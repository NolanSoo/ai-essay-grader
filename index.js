    ESSAY: "Unmasking the Face on Mars\n \n \"Come over here quick!\" As I told my NASA crew members, I told them that I had found something. Hi i'm a scientist at NASA diccusing the face that another scientist thinks it was created by aliens. As i told them they all came and was wondering what I needed them for and if I found clues. \"I think I found parts of the face that is not an aliens.\" states one of the scientist at NASA. We didn't find anything unusual, except that there may be more than one of the faces.\n \n Many of the scientist are starting to wonder if this face was created by aliens. Scientists have tooked camera over and there is no alien monument after all, But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied. The face on mars is located 41 degress north latitude. The camera they had been using had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. They said the aliens marks may have been hidden by haze but some didn't even think that their were aliens marking and said that it is just a natural landform, but then again how could they prove it.\n \n April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time ever. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal photos. Many anxious web surfers were waiting for the first image to appear on their screens. All they got was a natural landform no sign of alien transformation.\n \n Lastly, NASA had many images for web surfer to see. The caption that they had noted underneath was huge rock formation. Which is resembles a human head. It is formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose and mouth. The authors reasoned that it would be a good way t engage and attract the public attentions to Mars.\n \n What the picture was actually showing was the martian equivalent if a mesa or a landform. Which was common around the AMerican West. It reminds many people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idoho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same size as the face on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.\n \n The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.\n \n Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.",

Haha,..nope just a natural landform.\n \n Only a few scientist thought that the face was an artifact, but as soon as NASA heard this the made it a priority to go back and photograph Cydonia once again. Jim Garvin says \"We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" (Paragraph 6) This mean if it was an alien artifact NASA would have made money and benifited from finding this.\n \n However, when Michael Malin went back and photgraphed this again it revealed only a natural landform.(Paragraph 7) Later when others went back again to photograph it they were fortunet enough to get close enough to get a clear picture. (Paragraph 10)\n \n The picture acutally only shows the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.(Paragraph 12) Too bad for all those scientist who thought this was an alien artifact.

    ESSAY: "When the face on Mars was first descovred from a region of the planet called Cydonia first found in 1976, many people thought it might have been created by aliens. However this is not true, the face on this planet is a natural landform. The face is a natural landform because it is equivalent to a Martian mesa, there were no ther objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.\n \n The face on Mars is a mesa. A Martian mesa is commen around the area of Cydonia. The mesa is only seen as a face because it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The shadows give the rock formation the ilolusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.\n \n There were no other objects seen in any of the pictures that had been taken. Michael Malin's team captured an extraordinary picture using the camers's maximum resolution. \"As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size\" Garvin explaned. So if there were any objects in this picture such as airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even a small shack it would have been seen in the pictures.\n \n There was no alien movement detected on Mars. If it was aliens that created this face the camers's would have picked up the movement and captured pictures. On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed a natural landform proving there was no alien movement.\n \n The Face on Mars is a natural landform that looks like a face becasue of the shadows it was formed by. The Face is a natural landform that was not created by aliens because it is equivelant to a Martiam mesa, there were no other objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.",

    ESSAY: "This face landform stucture found on Mars was not made by any living source. I belive nature took its course and it so happened to look like a face. Eyes, nose mouth it looks like a face no doubt about it, but it cannot be stuctured by living substances. Most scientists have been saying that this face was made by aliens, but I have to disagree. It just simply can not.\n \n I belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times. There is basically no evidence that aliens have built this landface.\n \n Well If you still do not belive me and still think aliens have built this landface than I think you are insane because I gave you a bunch of reasons why there is no way and there is no evidence that aliens have built this landface. Everybody should be on my side and say mother nature has built this face, but untill there is prove aliens exist I don't think aliens should be in the topic about this.",

    ESSAY: "The face on Mars is just a natural landform. Their's really no existense of aliens, because theres no proof of them. The face is just a landform that was created with Mars. On Earth we have landforms that look like faces and other things that were created with Earth. There's also no proof that there's life on Mars, becuase there really isn't life on Mars.\n \n The existence of aliens is false, humans and animals are the only life forms out there pretty much. If there were proof of aliens then why arn't they on Earth then? Aliens never made that on Mars, that face was created when Mars was. NASA just used the face to get money, because this face was starred in a Hollywood film, it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store check out lines for 25 years. Then after that they really didn't care for the face anymore. Everyone was not really satisfied with the face on Mars.\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-- landforms common around the American West. Garvin a scientist even says that it reminds him of the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also says \"That's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n As you can see the face was never created or made by aliens. The face was created with mars. In the story, it even says that the landform was basically created with Mars. So in fact there is no existence of aliens and there is no life on Mars.\n \n In the ending of the story, it basically says the face is just a landform, it tells the height and everything about it. They even say that they don't pass over the face that much anymore. So it's just a true fact that the face a landform, they even said it was just a natural land form.",

    ESSAY: "Do you believe that the face on Mars is made by aliens? I know my opinion doesnt matter, what matters is whats real. I know you are also thinking that this is crazy, because we all know aliens do not exist. There is no proof of aliens.\n \n It has to be a natural landform, because in the 12th paragraph Garvin said it reminded him of Most Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. Our universe can create anything, just because something look like it was made does not mean it is. There could of been rocks there, and the dust just blows around them. Making it look like it was made, by something or someone. The very most obvious thing is aliens do not exist, there has been no proof of alien. Even to this day in 2016 there is still no proof of aliens.\n \n In the 3rd paragraph NASA even mentioned it as a \"huge rock formation\" scientist are very smart if there was other such thing that made it, it would have already been discovered. Also the face on Mars was a good way to get attention, like paragraph number 5 said so. The face of Mars turned into a famous pop icon. It was on Hollywood films, all the way to Haunted grocery store check out lines. If people could get the public to think that it was aliens that made the face, it would have maybe become way more popular. Plus most people do not believe in such thing as aliens, if they do not have real proof.\n \n My very last example is , if NASA found out was aliens they would have already told the public. It would be huge for NASA to discover aleins. There is no way they would hide the proof that aliens are real. It would help their budget, if they did discover an ancient alien civilization on mars. As it says in paragraph 6 scientist started hunting for more information. It became a priority for them. All the pictures they took revealed it as a natural landformation as it says in paragraph 7.\n \n There is no way it is related to Aliens. So if someone says that NASA is just hiding it, it would be false. NASA would surely reveal that there is aliens on another planet. Just imagine how much attention they would get if they actually discovered it. They would probably be one of the richest people. It is positive that a face on mars, made by aliens is not real.

    ESSAY: "Now there hasnt been real information on the existence of aliens or any other lifeforms of that kind. Stories behind those creatures are usually made up by many people. We dont have any evidence as to seeing or taking pictures of any aliens or UFO's. So why would aliens be on Mars?\n \n Due to the fact that researchers have identified that the \"Face\" is juast a mesa, I think is safe to say that there are no alien life forms on mars and there never was.\n \n Nasa has very good cameras that are way better than the ones in 1976. They can zoom in way more and take 3-D images as well. if there were aliens living on there you would be able to see UFO's and a whole lot of aliens on the planet. And if there were Egyptioan style pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see them to. The \"Face\" is a martian equivalent to a butte or mesa as scientifically proven by scientist.\n \n Another reason as to why the mesa on mars is a landform and not some alien made artifact is that in the article it said that there were shadowns giving off the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. \"Its a good way to enage the public and attract attention to mars\", as said in the story. Also making the Face a pop icon also would make more people think that there really is life on mars without any real evidence. The face appeared on movies and magazines, which made more and more people follow this trend of life on mars.\n \n The final reason as to why the object on mars is just a landform and not an alien made thing is that on a cloudy, wispy day, the photo was taken. Making it seem like the aliens did it on purpose. But, scientist took the photo again on a less cloudier day and found out that is was just a landfrom after all. when they shot it with their better camera, it showed that is was just made by mars just like earth makes its own lanforms sometimes. So it seems as though technology from back then just wasnt updated enough to get the job done.\n \n Ultimately, the reason that evryone thought that there were life on mars is because technology wasnt as evolutionized as it was in 2001 compared to 1976. With the technology today, we would be able to find out right away if there were actually life on mars. So in conclusion, there is not life on mars and there never was.",

The picture shows a Martian like butte or mesa.\n \n After all the research Garvin says, \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" By saying that its pretty clear that is was any of what you may be thinking. Before all the research I though it was an alian or a creture too . Now there is nothing to worry about is just a natural landform just like Earth have some too.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as \"The Face on Mars.\" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.\n \n Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.\n \n On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.\n \n Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was. Now NASA had proved that this brilliant \"face\" was only a landform.\n \n NASA did endless amounts of research in hopes of finding evidence of martian life, so why would they hide something like that? Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform. The research NASA has put into may not have given them the results they wanted, but it may later benefit them in finding life on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist I had to discusss the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation of the face on Mars giving the mosts reasonable and lucid -something clearly shown- ideas. There is many reasons why this \"face\" was not made by aliens. As a scientist I had to explain some evidence that would show what this \"face\" is classified as. Also I had to show the main ideaology on these speculations or conspiracies that \"know\" what NASA is doing. My main job as scientist is to observe, study, and explain many mysteries but I had to use clearly expressed qualifications for the face to be created by aliens.\n \n For my first reasoning on this topic I had to discuss this person how this landform is classified as mesa or butte which occurs normally in many environments. Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, \"It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\" showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!\n \n After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.\n \n Another type of reasoning this \"face\" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this \"face\" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the \"face,\" shows that the \"face\" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a \"face\" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.\n \n Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.\n \n So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the \"face\" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the \"face\" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "The \"face on mars\" is not a real face. The face is a mesa or butte that looks like the ones found in the American west. It looks like a face by the shadows that form on it. The camera that found the \"face on mars\" was old and later a new one took a picture that can clearly see the surface. The new camera cannot be argued with because it is the latest and clearest. Also why would NASA try to hide the fact that there was aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them alot.\n \n The mesa or butte on mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kindof sounds dumb. If you think about it in the way i do it would be lke an alien race looks down on our planet saw a mesa that looked like a face and thought we knew he was there and wanted look at him/her/it.\n \n Also dont you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the \"face\" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock.\n \n If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they was going to wait for a clear day too so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine,and the image is completely real too.\n \n If ther was really aliens on mars it would benefit them alot. Think about it why woul NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollors to study them. Also if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way,because what if they had technolligy we didn't wouldnt we already have it? If there were aliens wouldnt they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war.\n \n The \"face on mars\" is totally fake. Now that ive bestowed upon you my knowledge maybe you can pass it on to other conspiracy theorists. Then maybe the \"face on mars\" thing wil finally blow over. Next time something like this happens you can probably look into that further too. Also maybe just maybe conspiracy theorists might come to an end.",

They could've ruled us by now. The Face is a natural landform on Mars.\n \n To prove that this was not caused by aliens, NASA reported,\" Huge rock formation which resembles a human head that is formed by shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It is all just an illusion.

    ESSAY: "This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.\n \n The only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says \"Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all\". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?\n \n Scientists say that in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West\". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.\n \n But, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. \" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze\". So right now it shows that there could be a possibility that aliens could have made the Face. This one piece of evidence could be the evidence they are looking for.\n \n In conclusion, no one knows what made this interesting Face on Mars. But we do have a lot of information about what could have made it if it wasnt aliens. When we don't have a lot of information here, we can not really think what this Face was made by.

So we decide to send the picture back to NASA to see what they had to say about it. There replies where so shocking to us we could not belive it they that the face had been created by aliens.\n \n Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this.\n \n Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this.

    ESSAY: "If I were a scientist at NASA and I was disucussing the Face with someone who doesn't think the Face was just landformation I would say, it is because of what other scientist in NASA believe it was a landformation that looked like a real human face.\n \n The Face was just something formed by the planet because the artical says, \"huge rock formation... which resemles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Which means that is was just a rock that was formed a different way to look like it was a face. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but there were more scientist to prove them wrong. Another piece of evidence was when they were taking pictures Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. This evidence goes with my argument because if it was some type of alien siglnal the camera would of picked it up and they would of seen what it really was, but they didn't all they saw was a landform like the ones around American West.\n \n In conclution it was not an alien signal, or artifact, it was just a piece of land formed differently. Now you all know it wasn't from aliens. All it was, was an illusion that looked like a real human face with a nose, eyes, and more. Don't assume everything on other planets are always from aliens because for now we don't have proof aliens exist.",

    ESSAY: "The fae on mars is just another landform. I think this becasue there are land forms that form exactly like it on earth, and why would the government let us see pictures of it if it was an artifact from some alien civilization.\n \n The face on mars is just a messa. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" So infact it is not an artifact of a alien civilization because there are landforms just like it on earth from domes of lava that take the shape of an isolated mesa.\n \n If this was an actuallly conspirasy than why is it not being hidden from us. \"Although few scitests believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the REad Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.\" They did not take more pictures becasue they believed that there was some kind of alien artifact, they took mare pictures because the pictures they had from before were eighteen years old. So things on mars could have changed during those eighteen years.\n \n After all of the proving that it was not an alien artifact there were still some skeptics. \"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze.\" Then NASA took more pictures on a clear sunny day and used a really high pixalization to show people that if there were peryamids on mars they would be able to see them in the picture.\n \n This just shows to prove that the face on mars is just in fact a landformation and not an alien artifact. NASA has proved many times again and again that this mestry face is not mare that just a mesa that formed on mars. Skeptics will keep tring to prove NASA wrong but there is not another logical explainization than the Face just being a landform on mars.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars is not what everyone thinks it is. Hollywood shows, magazines, and radio talk shows can exaggerate to make the landform sound like more than what it truly is. As a NASA scientist, I believe that you should know exactly what this historic landmark is, so you know the correct story for years to come.\n \n First, you never know what publicity will do with the next big story. Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. \"Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.\n \n To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. \"....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.\" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.\n \n In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",

    ESSAY: "Why do you believe the face was created by aliens? When looking at this image, you can think about that at first but if you believe it immediately, then there is something wrong about that. I will explain to you why the face was not created by aliens though i will also explain why someone may believe that.\n \n The face is an image we found in 2001 that was taken by our Viking 1 spacecraft that was circling the Mars. The face is an area of land on Mars that has the illusion of a face. The illusion of the face comes from the shadows making the land look like it has a nose, eyes, and a mouth that resembles a human face. It was a surprise for most people here at NASA but we didn't believe it was alien works immediately because we didn't have any real evidence of it. It just so happened to be a patch of land that looked like a face.\n \n We couldn't say it was made by aliens because we needed proof of that and we haven't studied Mars' enough to prove that aliens made the face. We know Mars is similar to Earth but it's still a different planet in our solar system. Although we hoped it might've been an alien civilization, we studied the face more and it was simply a landform similar to a mesa or butte of our world.\n \n Even though we know it was just a landform, there are reasons we could see people saying it might've been made by aliens. We know Mars is able to sustain life because of it's conditions and there has been few deposits of water found there, but we have never found an actual living species on the planet itself. We as humans still don't know if aliens live on Mars or if aliens from other worlds exist at all. Many people believe there are aliens from other planets and some don't really care about the subject at all but it is possible that there's life on other planets.\n \n Because we haven't figured out if Mars has life, people believe the strange and convinient findings on Mars (like the face) are works of alien beings. Although we have confirmed the face was not a work of aliens, we still don't know if aliens exist. We can conclude that the face is not the work of aliens but there just might be unearthly beings on our neighboring planet, Mars. Before we can confirm there are alien beings on Mars, we would need evidence to explain they do exist at all. But we can conclude, the face is not made by aliens.",

According to the text it states,\"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible.

Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too.

    ESSAY: "Have you ever wanted to be apart of NASA or a scientist? Scientist get to explore many parts of the world, even outer space. Have you ever wanted to travel to Mars known as the, \"Red Planet?\" Mars has a long history, however some NASA scientists say that in 1967 they saw a face on Mars and some people thought that aliens created it.\n \n Twenty-Five years ago from this date May 24, 2001 a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars taking pictures of possible landings for the sister ship named Viking 2. As the spacecraft was circling around the planet Mars, it saw something very odd which was, shadowy likeness of a human face with and enorumous head nearly two miles from the end it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on the red planet called Cydoina. Soon scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, however this one had unsusual shadows which made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n As NASA looks at the images the caption said \"huge rock formation.\" The Mars then started to reveal images of a face such as the, eyes, nose, and mouth. Mars has now became a famous planet. The planet Mars has starred in Hollwood flims, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery story checkout line.\n \n The agurment now is weither or not the face was made by aliens and the answer is NO. In passage seven, it says, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orgional Viking photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landfrom. There was NO alien monument after all.\n \n I believe if I was in the NASA or if I were a scientist I would use passage seven to back my answer up. It gives all the details about why the aliens did not make the face on the planet Mars. Even though everyone would not be satisfied with my agurement, I now have proof that it was not created by aliens.",

    ESSAY: "Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.\n \n First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people.\n \n Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.\n \n Of course, people still weren't satisfied. Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face. After extensively studying the pictures, Jim Garvin states that it \"is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\". He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West. The Face is just a regular landform.\n \n In conclusion, that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Almost 30 years of research went by until they came to their conclusion. The Face is only a meer mesa. It was created naturally, and not by aliens. No one can argue with facts!",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist of NASA, I can say that \"The Face\" is in fact a landform. We made this conclusion when we first snapped a picture 10x faster of the face, we also took a second look and picture, and it has simalarites like a natural landform from the Snake River Plain of Idaho on Earth. But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory.\n \n In 1998 on April 5, for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. A picture was captured 10x better than the orginal viking photos. they were later posted on a website for the public to see but for the people who thought it was a sign of life on Mars, they were wrong. Scientist's said it was just a natural landform.\n \n For the second time, the scientist could yet again reach Cydonia once again to turn their conspiracy theory to fact. Others back on Earth said it was too windy and it made the clouds affect the picture. This time researchers used a maximum resolution camera to prove the theorists wrong. Yet again Garvin said, \" If there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were.\"\n \n Scientist said that the \"face\" was equivalent to a butte or mesa. They made this staement because there is something similar to it on Earth in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These are found around the American West. Garvin said, \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the \"Face on Mars.\"\n \n On the other side of things, there were many conspiracy theorists that questioned NASA's claim. Everyone wasn't satisfied with the pictures that were first taken people said it was during a cloudy season, that's why there was another trip with more advanced equipment. They also stated that the camera on board had to go through the clouds and dust to see the face so the picture couldn't been shown clearly. Another claim they made is that since there were wispy clouds the alien markings could be hidden in the haze and scientists just didn't look hard enough.\n \n In conclusion we have the facts that we need to prove that \" The Face\" is just a natural landform. We have provided the public with two pictures. Plus we also made observations that it looked like a landform from here on Earth. As NASA, we would like to see the conspiracy theorists prove us wrong then they could state the facts for once.",

    ESSAY: "So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.\n \n My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.\n \n My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?\n \n The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. \"It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Garvin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.\" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.\n \n My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?\n \n This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.",

    ESSAY: "Many people, including nasa, believe that \" the Face\" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.\n \n First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.\n \n Secondly, the only reason it \"has\" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.\n \n Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.\n \n Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.\n \n Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",

    ESSAY: "Is There Really a Face on Mars???\n \n The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).\n \n When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.\n \n Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).\n \n Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.",

    ESSAY: "I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there.

    ESSAY: "The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.\n \n The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.\n \n Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.\n \n The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",

Very few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian Messa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" However, people thought it was a real face. When the picture went online or on TV, people thought it was \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Even though some people are defenders of NASA, we still shouldn't give them money to see if there is an actual ancient civilization. If we do we could possibly be putting that money to waste. We should think about if the pictures are real or if they were photoshopped.\n \n However, NASA has confirmed it a messa. Which is a natural landform. Since it is windy or cloudy on Mars this messa could have been pushed around to make it look like a face. Even though we got pictures we would still be able to see things like airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks. We could have actually seen those on the ground. NASA dosen't even pass over the face that often. In contrast, we would not be able to get much information on it. So we should not even worry about how to figure out what it is.\n \n Therefore, when scientists Jim Garvin says it reminds him of \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" we should think about how is he right. When a scientists says something big and important we are listening and comparing something on Earth to Mars means that it could have been caused by erosion. Even though we are just getting pictures of it isn't enough. We could have better pictures now then they did back then. In conclusion, erosion and plains on earth come naturally. We have no idea what that could be made of it could be made of, sand for all we now.\n \n Therefore, we may have confirmed pictures it is a face. But do we have pictures that it is not just darker sand. The face could be anything on Mars. Because their pictures confirmed it a messa, it is a natural landform. In contrast, it formed naturally. Just like how it looks like Middle Butte in Idaho. Which was formed naturally. If this gets people saying that their could be life on Mars we probably would have found it by now.\n \n All in all, if the face was real then why don't we have more advanced pictures of it. NASA only has older pictures of this so called \"Face\", it looks like a natural landform in Idaho. So next time NASA gets people crazy about another ancient alien civilzation, think about how they need to prove it.",

    ESSAY: "Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.\n \n First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?\n \n NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.\n \n If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.\n \n Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",

    ESSAY: "I know this wasn't created by aliens in many ways. It is just a naturally created landform that looks like face. If it was created by aliens then NASA would benefit from discovering life on a different planet, so that shows that everyone in NASA is sad that we didn't find life. Landforms created from nature shouldn't be lied about just to get attention. That is why we don't tell other people a lie when it is just a landfrom like the Grand Canyon. Here are also reasons how I know it wasn't created by aliens.\n \n Some rock formations on Earth are created by wind chipping off peices until one day the rocks are completely gone. We didn't have any control of the winds that created the rock formations, so that shows that nothing living created it. Around the face is other landforms that were created the same way the Face was made. The Face is the only one that people pay attention to becuase it looks like a face, but if you look at the entire picture you can see that other landforms are there that might not look like a face, but they show that landforms are created naturally there.\n \n These examples show us that these landforms were not created by aliens, but by the weather that accurs there. That is why we shouldn't lie just to get attention and make everybody believe something that isn't real. This concludes that the Face was only created by weather like the landforms on Earth.",

    ESSAY: "I know people think the face on Mars is something that was created by some kind of life, but really it is not. This is acually just a landform. The face was found in the region of the red planet called Cydonia. It is very hard for NASA to get the picture because they have to angle the satalite just right. I am not trying to be pestimistic but, NASA has seen landforms on Mars before and the article says,\"the mouth, nose, and eyes are allusions caused by shadows\". The facts just dose not add up to their being life on Mars.\n \n This face is just a landform. There are many ways this landform could have happend. For example, a duststorm, astroids crashing on the planet, or underground volcanos. These are all examples of how the face could have been created. The article says it was caused by butte or mesa. Time for everyone to come up with a new theory!\n \n This face was found in the area Cydonia. One day the aircraft Viking 1 was circaling the plant and found the face. Could you imagine the scientist face when the aircraft reported it back. A few days later they released it to the public. Lots of people were confinced that it was caused by some kind of lifeform, but really it was not.\n \n It was hard work for NASA to get the picture because they had to rotate the aircraft at 30 degrees. This was not easy because if they went to far Nasa would miss the face. If they did not go all the way around Nasa would still miss it . It had to be perfect. It could have been 29 degrees, one of, but it did not matter it would still miss it. It had to be perfect. NASA finnaly got the picture and proved that there was no lifeform.\n \n The nose, mouth, and eyes are caused by shadow illusions. They might have been formed by astroids crashing there, but are most likely shadow illusions. These illusions are caused when the Mars acsis are tillted a certain way and the sun hits it. This is most likly how the shadow allusion happened. This is what scientist says caused the illusion.\n \n In conclusion there were many ways for this landform to happen. Do not think this was caused by some kind of life form because there is not enough proff. There are many ways this could have been formed. For example. A dust storm, or underground volcano the list goes on. It may never be solved what caused it. Just face it it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars is a very mysterious thing, but it's only been caught on camera, clearly, once, but that was in the 1970s. The cameras in 1976 were not very clear, as you see they have a 43 meter span per pixel, which makes the picture a whole lot more blurry. Even though it's been seen all over the world as an unknown landform or an alien artifact, the evidence has been seen through, and the face, is, well, not really a face at all.\n \n The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars. Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001. Yet the picture doesn't depict an Egyption face staring back at you, but a standard, normal, everyday, Mars mesa. The pictures of the face in 1998 showed clearly that the face wasn't quite a face, with a camera 10 times sharper than the original Viking camera, yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars. Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time. The cameras' span was 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the Viking's 46 meters per pixel, and the planet of Mars was as clear as the eye could see at that time, but there was no unnatural objects to be seen. Yes, it is hard to prove that the famous mesa isn't man-made, you would have to be on the planet to do that, yet the facts and research is all here and it's time to let go.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars has been very iconic on what it has done to the people, and the world as a whole. It's been analyzed and researched over, over, and over again. And it all comes down to the cold hard facts, which all points to the intriging rock of 1976 of being just a rock formation that was, well, lets just say, for now... misunderstood.",

Many people like to make theories about subjects but nobody knows about the real information. Not unless we share it to the public, we will not share things we want to hide from everyone. The picture was not made by aliens and we explain why it is just a natural landform.\n \n If I were to be a scientist at NASA I would tell the person that the Face is just a natural landform. There are many conspiracy theorists that claim we are trying to hide something, such as saying aliens made the Face. In the article it says\n \n \" evidence that NASA would rather hide \" , that is correct. If the aliens did make it then we wouldn't have showed the public the photos. We would want to keep it out of newspapers, magazine, tv shows, and movies.\n \n NASA would also never want lots of people to see the picture of the Face if they were to hid something. We would make the picture an enigma to the citizens of the world. Scientist in NASA have studied these for years and they have all the information. Also in the third paragraph in the article it tells us that there are some shadows that make the the Face get the illusion of having eyes and a nose. The third paragraph says \" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. \" which is telling us that they want people to know more about Mars so we obvisouly wouldn't be showing the pictures if the aliens made it.\n \n Although there were few scientist that believed the Face was an alien artifact, in paragraph seven it says\n \n \" ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. \" , NASA scientist take their jobs very serious. People continued to say the Face markings were made from aliens but the NASA scientist said it was just a natural landform and some of the pictures were made from the shadows. On April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer in Cydonia, Malin's team got an \" extraordinary \" picture of the Face because many people such as the theorists said maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.\n \n In the second paragraph NASA was excited to see if the Face was something sensational and the article says \" Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. \" the only thing that made this one stand out was it has shadows that give it facial features such as a nose, eyes and a mouth. NASA soon showed the picture for all the people to see with a caption telling them what it was. NASA would not show the picture and make up something if the Face was really created by aliens.\n \n In the very last paragraph the article tells us what the picture actually shows from what the scientist at NASA have gathered. Paragraph twelve says \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. \". The scientist are telling us that the Face is just a landform, as a NASA scientist there is a lot of information about the Face and it was not made by aliens.

I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.\n \n First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.\n \n Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts.

Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.\n \n Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there.

    ESSAY: "For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, \"aliens\" have done so.\n \n In 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.\n \n To conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform. But in reality, no one has the facts to prove that an alien life-form had created this landform. No one has the facts to prove there are alien civilizations on Mars. I only say this because there has not yet been facts, or any information involving alien-life forms or ancient civilizations on mars. Maybe in the future, there will be signs of some type of life-form on Mars, or very odd, peculiar objects that we may find somewhat weird, or, out of the ordinary.

    ESSAY: "I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the \"face\" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.\n \n The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.\n \n Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing.

You can't see all the details.\" At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural.\n \n This Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientists have even compared it to buttes and mesas here on Earth. An example of this comparison was by Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. He said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho stating, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\" Also, Mars is known for being a very dusty and rocky planet. It would be very easy for the formations of Mars to erode together and make such a landform as this.\n \n In addition to it just being a natural landform, there is absolutely no evidence of life near this area or anywhere else. This goes to show that it can't be man/ alien made. The NASA scientists, are using the highest quality cameras in technology today. They zoom in to 1.56 meters per pixel, allowing them to see every little detail. After doing this they found no shelter, no water, no life showing any forms of a civilization. There has never been any life, outside of maybe bacteria, found on Mars, and even if there was, NASA would quadruple their funds after that kind of discovery giving them no reason to hide it.\n \n The Face of Mars is simply a natural landform similar to a butte or mesa similar to those on Earth, with no alien interaction.

    ESSAY: "In the Story \"Unmasking the Face on Mars.\" The face on mars has apparently been founded in 1976, NASA claimed the the face was formed by a alien, Here is were I come in, The world had made a bunch of movies including aliens from mars, Mars, for hundreds maybe thousands of years have been the 'Aliens home'. Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Â“MalinÂ’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameraÂ’s absolute maximum resolution.Â”\n \n That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.\n \n Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â”\n \n This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. Â“huge rock formation....\" It basically says that the rock is a formation \".......giving the illusion......\" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth. I clearly gives out that opinion that if you put it together you get \"A huge rock formations giving the illusion.........\" and so on.\n \n I also think that The 'face' Is just a rock the looks like a face, clearly I stated that. Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...\"over time it transformed .....\" in the text... \"Huge rock FORMation.\" It is just a rock thats looks like a face, and just because it's on mars don't mean a thing.",

    ESSAY: "Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a \"shadowy likeness of a human face\". Shadows on the object give \"the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.\n \n In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.\n \n The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.",

    ESSAY: "There are a variety of perspectives and opinions related to the Face on Mars. Many say that it's simply a lava dome, or that it could just be a strange rock molded in such a way where it may appear to be a face. However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.\n \n This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures. They thought of many different possibilities to why this was formed in a way that reminded us of an Egyptian Pharaoh such as the possibility of the camera's angle, the shadows covering it. Basically we thought of everything minus the chance that it may have been the works of such \"aliens\".\n \n Aliens have been the illogical reasoning to many things we find on the various assortments of planets so hearing that this recent discovery was blamed on aliens isn't very shocking. We spent a few days deciding whether or not to show the images captured to the public, but in the end we decided to do so. The Face on Mars instantly became a well-known subject all over the world things such as movies, magazines, and even radio and tv talk shows all spoke of the mysterious Face on Mars. Many considered this discovery as the new pop icon. During this there were many conspiracy theorists who began to state that the Face on Mars was the work of aliens. However that's the thing, there are no statistical facts simply a load of different conspiracies made from people who strongly believe in such things! Considering there is lack of proof on even the stance that aliens are real the \"case\" was never thoroughly thought through.\n \n There can be various reasonings and opinions about the Face on Mars and though they may be very amusing or interesting to hear, the reality of it is really that it is simply an isolated lava dome. This isn't the first time that natural landforms have represented such things as faces or even common artifacts. There is still research going on about what's casuing these strange formations, but you can be sure that it's not the work of aliens.",

Some conspiracy theorists believe that a face found on Mars from a photo taken by Viking 1 - a Mars Global surveyor -\n \n was created by aliens who lived on the planet over 300 billion years ago. NASA released information and a picture about the 'Face on Mars,' to the media, with the caption, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head.\" The face believed to be found on Mars is nothing less then a rock formation, and was not created by aliens.\n \n Mission controller Garvin says, \"It's not easy to target Cydonia.\" He also noted that his crew does not pass over the Face very often. This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years. Over time the wind and atmosphere has shaped the rock into the form of what looks to be a Face.\n \n NASA leaked evidence about the Face on Mars when they unveiled the image for the public and media to see, stating clearly that the Face was formed by, \"shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see the image on a JPL website, the text in fact quoted, \"It was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n The people that do believe that there was alien life on Mars, think that the aliens markings were hidden by haze, and believe the Face is \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Contarary to what skeptics and other theorists think, there is no actual piece of true evidence discovered by NASA to prove otherwise.\n \n Garvin and his team said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyarmids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" So this actual NASA evidence that the mysterious \"Face\" found on Mars was nothing but a simple landform.\n \n The NASA Space Program has been around for decades. NASA has not yet found evidence to consider the Face on Mars was alien artifacts. Even with NASA's best cameras, there just isn't a theoretical proven fact that this could have become an artifact from ancient aliens.

On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia.\n \n Back at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figures it was just another Matian mesa, around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.\n \n Some might believe that the so called \"alien artifact\" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth.\" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they \"photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it.\" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.\n \n As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the \"camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,\" and according to skeptics, \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that \" It's not easy to target Cydonia,\" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is \"bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.\n \n In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too.

These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976.

The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big.

I've thought about it and I have read this story called \"Unmasking The Face on Mars\" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.\n \n When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption \"...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth.\" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This \"face\" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.\n \n Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage \"It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.\n \n Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that \"the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.\"(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.\n \n After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars\" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all.",

    ESSAY: "The face on mars is not created by aliens this is a natural landform on earth there already were landforms that were created. We can't say aliens made those too. Such as vocanoes, rivers, and mountains we also couldn't say we built those because we didn't. If aliens really did build the face on mars how come their isn't any proof anything was on the planet? If there was any form of a living species you would have at least seen Egyptian- style pyramids or even small shacks.\n \n Mars is a planet that is know for having rocks on it, there is a possibility that this is just a huge rock that was carved into the planet already or the planet it's self got either hit by and astroid or had been forming it's self in some way. Aliens could'nt have build the face they would've needed soem short of unground passege or even shelter's, none of these things were found when we discoverd the face. We get the picture looks blurry btu even with zooming in you can't see any such thing as if there was an alien.\n \n Scientist has studied the photos the astronots had brought home we saw their were may rocks this could have been a mistake. How would an alien know what a human face looks like anyways? By our understand we could be looking at it and imageing it's a face when really it's just a rock that was formed to look like a humans head.\n \n April 5, 1998 when mars Global Surveyor flew oven the face he snapped pictures ten times sharper then the original Viking photos. Thousands of people anxious to have the photo appear on JPL web site by yet still came out with saying that it was just an natural landform. People were not satisfied, this bring's me back to the point were it was just our imagination maybe we're lookingat it wrong it's really meant to look like one thing but were making it look like another.\n \n We belive that if aliens really did make this face how come their wasn't any type of form in which we can tell their was any type of life form living on mars? Landscapes are usual to see on planest and this was one of them. If there was any type of life form i think Michale Malin would have already taken pictures of them if he had seen anything. He didn't which means this face was actually a natural landform.",

    ESSAY: "Do you think the Face on Mars is real? The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. If there was something that made this, they would leave tracks. But there's nothing.\n \n The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. Scientist says it's a \"mesa.\" Which is common in Mars in Cydonia. It also said that NASA said \"a huge rock formation which forms a head, eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" So everything is made out of bunch of rocks. Michel Malin and his Orbiter snapped the picture ten time bigger than the original picture in 1998. So then it revealed a \" natural landform.\" Theres nothing special about. It's was just land. Later on, Malin's team did a second picture but bigger in 2001. Gavin said there were other objects like shack, airplanes, pyramids, etc. They were all made natural. Also, in Earth, there are many landfroms that looks like things. Like Middle Butte in the Snake River. And it is almost the same size as the Face on Mars.\n \n Just because it's on Mars doesn't mean it made by aliens. It's made out of natural. Sometimes strange objects appear around the Earth. Thats because it's normal to the us and enviroment. It's just a natural form. Its just the lack of conspiracy theorist.",

    ESSAY: "The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.\n \n The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of \"The Red Planet\" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.\n \n The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. \" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken.\" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.\n \n Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.\n \n Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity\n \n My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa. The mesa on the planet is only a natural landform that happens to look like a face. Nothing more and nothing less.",

Lastly, their camera would have caught any glimpse of alien markings. These statements are valid because looking at the evidence provided it gives you more facts that any skeptic could.\n \n The passage states that the Face is just the shadow of where the camera was, then creating the affect of the eyes, nose, and mouth that you see in the pictures.

That is not true because in paragraph 11 they state that they can make a pixel 3 times its size.

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1 snapped a photo of what looked to be a Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA released the picture to the public. The \"Face on Mars\" became a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people still believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is the work of aliens. I believe the \"Face on Mars\" is not the work of aliens, but a natural landform.\n \n The article gives good evidence that the \"Face on Mars\" is just another weird natural landform on Mars. In paragraph 5, conspiracy theorists claim the \"Face on Mars\" is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide. In paragraph 3, NASA unveiled the image for all to see in 1976. The caption noted, \"a huge rock formation...which resembles the shape of a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars; which it certainly did just that. The authors of the article wanted to attract attention towards Mars and NASA even claimed that it was a huge rock formation in the caption. Later, stating that shadows gave the huge rock formation the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper and clearer than the original Viking photos. The picture taken in April of 1998, would most likely not have shadows to give illusions of the face, nose, and mouth. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. NASA again stating and proving that the \"Face on Mars\" was just another out of place natural landform on Mars. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Here again we can see NASA trying to prove that the \"Face on Mars\" in still just a weird natural landform on Mars. Someone who stills believes that the \"Face on Mars\" is the work of aliens might say something like this. The \"Face on Mars\" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim. However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001. The photo taken in April 2001, the weather was perfect-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The photo taken that year still looks like a natural landform on Mars.\n \n The excellent reasons stated above prove yet again that the so called \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural landform.

There are also lots of different holes around the landform which means more have must have been formed close by the landform. Also im sure if there was someone or something on Mars when this happened NASA would have saw. The NASA also had said that \"There was no alien monument after all.\" Which means that there must not had have been aliens on Mars after all. So the landform had to just be a natural landform. I honestly don't even think that aliens are even smart enough to know excatly how to prcocess this landform. The landform doesn't look done with any kind of tool or anything so therefore I think that yes the sculpture is a natural landform even though that's kind of weird & the article actually shows that as the years go by the landform starts to form even more.

When our Viking 1 was scanning the planet to find a safe place for the next space craft to land, Viking 2, Viking 1 suddenly \"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" The scientists at first, were excited, but then we realized that it was probably a common Martian mesa. We just assumed that \"this one had unusual shadows.\" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.\n \n Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.\n \n Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was \"winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.\n \n Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a \"cloudless summer day.\" \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,\" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution.

So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin stated.

    ESSAY: "Why does NASA consider the \"Face of Mars\" to be a natural landform? They claim that the \"face\" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.\n \n Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed \"haze\" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.\n \n In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called \"alien face.\" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the \"alien face\" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.\n \n On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure \"resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face of Mars\" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",

When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.\n \n Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up. Landforms can have all kinds of shapes and the face of Mars just has a very unique shape. In conclusion, the face of Mars is just a odd shaped Butte.",

    ESSAY: "Do aliens really exist and are they capable of doing something like this? I don't think they could but if they were capable of doing something like this. We will need some proof to stand with this. There is 3 reasons why this is just a natural landform. They can just be like any landform on earth, a face like this can happen anywhere else, and if you believe in aliens are they really capable of doing something like this?\n \n The first reason why this is just a natural landform is because it can also happen on earth. For example, this can happen upon natural sources. Such eratation and it can just be a mesa. Another example is, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough round Cydonia\"(2). If this is common than most likely it wouldn't be made by any alien. My last example for this is, most landforms have ways it can look. The landforms can happen anywhere and that wouldnt mean it was caused by an alien. If something like this happened on earth most people would think it was caused by natural thigs like the weather.\n \n My second reason is that things can happen anywhere. For example, another planet my have this but that doesnt mean an alien went and left it there so we could find it. If an alien did this we would be able to find something almost the same as this face. Another example is, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars\"(5). This can be true but if it was an alien wouldnt they do a face they new or reconized. Lastly, in the passage it states that \"There was no alien monument after all\". The picture clearly showed a landform not an alien made monument. In conclusion, things like this can happen in different forms but nobody has proven it was made by an alien.\n \n My last reason for why this is not an alien made monument is because there is no proof that aliens made it. For example, have aliens been proven to exist. No proof was every made that aliens exist in the planet mars. Secondly, how could they build such a thing. if aliens built it than there must be a great amount of them that we did not know about. Lastly, if aliens aready built a Face on Mars why can't they do the same thing on Earth. there is no explanation of they wouldn't be able to do this. In order for the aliens to make something like this that would mean they are capable of this and more but they still haven't been proven to exist.\n \n In conclusion, the face could have been made by something other than aliens. The three reasons explaining why it couldn't have been aliens is it could have been done by nature, it can happen somewhere else, and are aliens capable of this. This can prove that aliens didnt build it, that it could have been made by different things.",

    ESSAY: "The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.\n \n There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.\n \n If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.\n \n They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.\n \n While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.",

    ESSAY: "I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform. It may look like a face but it is really not. What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away. So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad. It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.",

As a scientist we are constantly getting information from people about their thoughts on the Face on Mars. We get many suggestions, such as the face being created by aliens. Well as a scientist I'm here to tell you it was not created by aliens.\n \n This face on Mars was not created by aliens, but was created by nature itself. The Face on Mars is a natural landform. I know this because as a scientist of NASA we believe this face is just a huge rock formation. This rock resembles a human head. The human head formed by shadows, giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and lastly a mouth. Many authors that have researched on this topic believe it will attract more attention to planet Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars has became a very big deal. It has played a role in movies, showed up in magazine articles, and has been a topic on radio talk shows. Many people have come to conclusion that NASA would rather hid information about this such thing. But NASA just wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\n \n Many people still believe that this artifact came for aliens, but few scientist and have come to believe this is true. NASA takes pictures of the Face on Mars but many aren't satisfied by the quality of the pictures. As a scientist at NASA it is very challenging to capture a good photo because this face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude. This means that the camera has to peer through many wispy clouds to catch the face.\n \n We scientist at NASA have come to conclusion that this Face on Mars isn't created by aliens because of those reasons. Although many others may disagree and believe NASA is hiding information on this artifact. As a scientist that works for NASA, we will continue to look more into this specific topic and hopefully be able to know for a fact that this is created by landform and not aliens.",

According to the text, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,\" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.\n \n Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said \"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars, is it really what NASA says it is? The Face on Mars is really what they say it is;a face on Mars. Most belivers in the alien world believe that aliens did do it, while most scientist do not. I am a scientist at NASA working on the \"project\" and most scientist believe that it was just a giant mesa or a \"mountain\" or something that was formed by natural effect.\n \n I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that. In April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia, for the first time ever, and snapped a very \"sharp\" picture of the \"site'.\n \n Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.\n \n The belivers in aliens were still not satiisfied on the image they had seen on the internet due to the weather that day. Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the \"reasearchers\" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.\n \n After they had gotten the second picture they \"blew it up\" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids. The picture acutally showed that it is the, Martian equivalent, size of a buttle or (a. k. a. a mesa) which are landforms most commonly made by nature in the American West.\n \n \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Gavin. \"Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n I hope this has convienced you to believe that the picture is real and that aliens did not build it and that the pictures and people that have spoken told you that it is just a natural landform that was created by \"mother-nature.",

There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.\n \n After studying the \"face\" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the \"face\" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the \"face\". There are many other theories of what the for may be.\n \n I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the \"alien head\" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the \"face\" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the \"face\" was real, but can you always trust magazines.

    ESSAY: "Twenty-five years ago a photo was taken of a natural landform that appears to look like a face. Many people will argue that it isn't a natural landform but, more of an alien artifact. While the two sides still don't see eye to eye they both have evidence that could support their belief.\n \n While, some people think that the face on Mars is \"bona-fide evidence\" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was \"important to the taxpayers\" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.\n \n So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.\n \n While NASA hasn't changed there opinion because it is in fact just a landform. Many people still want good proof that it could quite possibly be acient civilization. So, they prepared to send up another. This time they sent it up on a cloudless summer day so that no-one could argue that the weather affected the pictures. NASA was right again. This time they took up a camera that zoomed in the structure and it didn't show anything new that would have meant that there has ever been any life there.\n \n All together, these facts prove that it is just a landform. A scientist named Garvin was quoted saying \"That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The face is indeed just like a landform that we have here on Earth. Although the other side of this long running debate did have some evidence that might have made NASA think twice, there is still more proof that it is a landform.",

    ESSAY: "Face The Landform?\n \n Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.\n \n First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that \"face\" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.\n \n After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.\n \n Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.\n \n So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.",

    ESSAY: "In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the \"Face on Mars\". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.\n \n When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that \"the Face\" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that \"the Face\" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.\n \n Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture \"huge rock formation...\" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of \"the Face\". The articles states the the image was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\". This image proved that \"the Face\" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph \"on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look\". It also says \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says \"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West\". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.\n \n The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that \"the Face\" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars. Who knows?",

However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.\n \n First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.\n \n Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,\" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.\n \n Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,\" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Also, paragraph twelve states,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West.\" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.\n \n In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",

    ESSAY: "Mesa on Mars\n \n Who or what created this \"face\" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say \"the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This \"face\" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.\n \n To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it states, \"...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos.\" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...\" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.\n \n Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this \"face\" for what it is?\n \n Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars.\" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.\n \n Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the \"face\" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and \"sunny\". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been \"obducted by aliens\". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that \"scientists don't believe there is a chance of this\" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.\n \n All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa. All of these things proove that not only was \"the Face of Mars\" just a natural forming landform. Will you know the real cause of something like \"The Face of Mars\" next time you see one?",

But a big percentage of those people said it looked like an aliens face which was a Huge rock formation but they kept defending their statement. But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.\n \n Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so. The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement. On Mars there is that to, the only three things Mars dosen't have is oxygen, water, or any subtance of food or plants that make oxygen. The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars. The thing is that no one really could of created that without any food or water.\n \n I think after all the research NASA has done and the studying of the natural landform on Mars that was created by Rock Formation turns out to be ture and for evryone that thinks that me and my team at NASA are wrong well no i don't think i am wrong i think i am way beyond positive that we are right because NASA has done everything they can to bring the people the right information. The people that think the natural landform was created by alliens need to join NASA so they can come along see that NASA brings only the truth noting but the truth to the people. But NASA always trys to do there best to convince people to know the right information and to have the correct facts in hand.",

    ESSAY: "The face on Mars is just another fake thing happening in this world. Honestly it is just another natural landform. Scientist might have been shocked when they saw it back in 1976 but know they are understanding and learning that the face is just a natural landform.\n \n The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.\n \n Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.\n \n This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.\n \n This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.\n \n The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.\n \n Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.\n \n When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.\n \n This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.\n \n The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.\n \n Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.\n \n Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.\n \n Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.\n \n This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.\n \n If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face.\n \n The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Scientists made a discovery on Cydonia,a region on the Red Planet. NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of the area, looking for sites for its sister ship, Viking 2. While it began to take pictures of the region, it spotted a human-like face. Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.\n \n It has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos. There was no alien monument, only a natural landform. Finally, they gave up.\n \n After eighteen long years of investigation, many researchers gave up on the Face. Many natural landforms disappear over time which is why scientists and researchers can no longer find it. Although, some researchers are still on the look out for the Face, hoping to find it again soon.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1 took a picture of what looked to be a a human face on Mars. A few days later the picture was reviealed to the public eye, and it was starred in hollywood film movies, books, magazines, and talks shows. But in 2001, new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it was only a mesa. Though there are many credible reasons to believe that it was only a mesa, some people still believe that is an alien artifact.\n \n Yes, one might think that the mesa looks like a face from an egyptian Pharoh, but after closer examination, it was only a natural landform. We are able to prove this because on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Sureyor flew over for the first time, a picture was taken that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that showed only a natural landform. When the picture was unveiled to the public eye, it had a caption that told people it was a mesa that resembled a human face only because shadows that were on the rock gave an opticl illusion of eye,nose, and mouth. Also on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enogh for a second look and used the cameras absolute maximum resolution to take an even better picture that again showed that it was only a mesa. From these pictures alone you can tell that there wasn't a face on Mars and that there isn't any extraterrestial beings living on Mars.\n \n in conclusion, the \"face\" on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform that you can probably see on Earth. Also if there were to actually be life on Mars, it would be a major break through that would help better fund NASA, so what would be the piont in trying to hide it from the public that funds our research?

    ESSAY: "So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?\" the man asked. \"I'm not buying it.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" I replied, \"and I'm about to show you why I'm right.\"\n \n The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, \"I'm all ears.\"\n \n The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\".\n \n To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the \"face\" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.\n \n \"Whatever, geek!

This figure is probably a fake because how often do you go to a planet and just find a random rock that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up.

It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.\n \n First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This \"alien created object\" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?\n \n Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.\n \n Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this \"plain\" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.\n \n It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.\n \n Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this.

    ESSAY: "Face\" the Facts\n \n The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the \"truth\" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the \"Face on Mars\" is nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" it says \"...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.\n \n Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.\n \n Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.\n \n To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to\n \n In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.\n \n - E.M.",

NASA has sent numerous things into space but one in specific has caused a great deal of curiosity through out the world. In 1976, a NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, took pictures of Mars and something unusual happened. A face apeared in a picture. At first NASA thought of the possibility of it being a foreign life form. But that possibility was stopped when scientists found out that it was just another Martian Mesa. A common landform on Mars. When the pictures were released to the public, many thought that NASA was lying, especially conspiracy theorists. They thought that NASA didn't want the public to know about an alien life form. That was very irrational.\n \n Many people don't like the idea of space exploration because they say it's a waste of money. If NASA encountered foreign life forms, it would only be benefitial to tell the public because then NASA would gain popolarity and skeptism of the program would decrease. Many people would be curios about it and would want to know more about the race. Therefore NASA would have a better reputation and be more popular because of their discovery.\n \n Secondly,technology has changed significantly since 1978. The original picture looks more like the face than any other one because of the old technology. In 1998, the picture looks more detailed. In 2001, it looks even more detailed. In 1976 the camera that took the photo only captured 43 meters per pixel making it much less definated compared to the picture taken in 2001 that captured 1.56 meters per pixel. This technology makes it less of a face.\n \n Finally, because of the newer and more advanced technology, NASA's scientists could look further in to the so called alien face. After studying it, the scientists concluded that the \"face\" was a mesa. A mesa isnt't only found on Mars. It can also be found on Earth. There is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it even has the same height as the Face on Mars. The \"face\" is more of a natural landform than anything.\n \n New technoogy, comparable lndforms, and the explanation of how alien races would benefit NASA helped the space program prove conspiricy theorists and the public wrong. All of these supports are hard evidence that the face was a mesa in disguise. Although the finding of an alien race would be revolutionary, it's safe to say that the \"face\" isn't the discovery of one. We'll just have to wait until the future to encounter a race that isn't our own.",

    ESSAY: "Since we had sent surveyors to Mars we have found many interesting things. We learned about much of the landscapes there and compared them to what we have here. Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa biom. The face in the area of Mars know as Cydonia is a mesa biom, so natural formations accur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa biom.\n \n The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not a alien structure. As it said in the article, \"Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact.\" They are the ones that truely study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique stucture that was naturaly created.\n \n The second reason is that the first image was burry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were cearer and prooved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.\n \n The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa biom. Things like this form all the time and should not be thought of a being made by anything other than nature. Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to accur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.\n \n There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa biom so this is natural.",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist at NASA I strongly believe that the \"The Face on Mars\" is simply a martian from of a mesa, which is commonly found on Cydonia. According to the text \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This was of course after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydonia and captured a higher resolution image of \"The Face.\" In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.\n \n Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.\n \n In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon \"Mars martian face\" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere. There was no need for all the chaos and random conspiracy theories, all it need was a little bit of science and hard work.",

On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.\n \n First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the \"facial features\" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.\n \n Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.\n \n Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the \"face\". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.\n \n In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point.

    ESSAY: "I can see why you can think that \"the Face on Mars\" is some form of proof that either alien life did at one time or is still cuurrently on Mars . The human mind is meant to think, imagine and wonder \"what if\". Let's say these \"aliens\" are in fact real and constructed \"the Face\" in order to communicate with us. Carving a giant face has got to be one of if not thee least effective way of dong so.\n \n These \"aliens\" very well could have simply just put a peice of shiney metal on the surface and the MGS would have seen it and we would probaly think \"hey, this unknown element is here on the surface of a planet where there are no metals\". Not only would it make us think that there is indeed metals on Mars but then we would think \"hey metals most usually form deep undergroud so there is no reason for this to be on the surface\". THAT would be a valid way of letting us know \"hey, we exist\".\n \n Also another thing, if \"aliens\" made \"the Face\" how is it no footprint s were found. And there's no wind on Mars they coulnt have blown away. Seriusly, that's a big project so you're gonna need a lot of your alien buddies to help you out with it and no footprints....hmm. Well hey,maybe they have got giant eagle wings and fly everywhere. Yeah, on a planet that HAS NO GRAVITY!\n \n Let's face it though (ha, face, get it?) everybody loves a good \"supernatural \" story. I believe that this is nothing more. \"Once in 1976 a NASA spacecraft was looking for a place to land, and there on the surface they found... a huge human's face carved out of the surface Mount Rushmore style....wooouuh\"\n \n In conclusion, The very thought that \"aliens\" somehow carved a face onto Mars is ridiculis . And the final nail in the coffin? When you hear \"conspiricy theorist\" you think of a frail, usually middle aged, pale becuase he hasn't stepped out of his trailer in weeks, guy with a aluminum cone on his head and always taling about how\"The Man\" is out to get him.\n \n Also he is dirty becuase hasnt shaved or showered in like a year.

When NASA unveilde the picture for everyone to see they specificly said in the caption that it was a huge rock formation that resembled a humans face, but because of the shadows it gave the illusion of a human face because of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Which is not really possible for the people to believe that Aliens had created this because of all the pictures that where taken there was no picture with a alien life form. Another reason for this is that you can see things in the digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. That way if there were other objects on Mars than you would be able to see that they were.

    ESSAY: "Many people still believe that the Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it's to hard to really know what the object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.\n \n Based on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn't mean it is that.\n \n Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west.\" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.\n \n The first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, \"the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze.\" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.\n \n Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, \"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.\n \n Based on research, and facts from, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars\"\n \n On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.\n \n Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.\n \n The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA\"s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.\n \n In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",

NASA was confident that it was a formation as well after posting it on their website they captioned \" A huge rock formation\" this shows that the majority of NASA believe this as well. I know no aliens know what we look like because we never seen any aliens orbiting or trying to take a photo.

Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.\n \n Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars. Usually the crafts land on 3 or more legs. The craft could have possibly marked a dust mound. Wind three or more legs, you could form the face on Mars' surface.\n \n What NASA needs to do is send more crafts and robots.

    ESSAY: "The face is just a natural landform and not evidence of an alien attack. There are many reasons why this landform is only natural and not any type of alien proof. One of those is that if NASA found a secret alien civiilization they would tell us because it would help increase their budget. Another reason that it's just a natural landform is because it is just like some other natural landforms on Earth and other mesa's on Mars. The last reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that NASA is scietifically trained and would know if it was proof of alien's existence but the conspiracy theorists aren't scientifically trained and would be less likely to know exactly what it is.\n \n The first reason that it's just a natural landform is that NASA would tell us if it was proof of an alien attack. It states in the text that \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" which shows how it would help increase their budget. Since the Face is so popular and has even become a pop icon if NASA were to find out it was proof of an alien attack they would most likely tell us because since it is so popular it would give them a significant increase to their budget. That is just one of the three reasons that I will b talking about in this essay.\n \n The second reason that the Face is just a natural landform is because it is just like other landforms on Earth and around that area on mars. In the article it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West\". That passage from the article shows that there are landforms on Earth that look similar to that one on Mars so it couldn't be proof of an alien attack. The article also says \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh\". That shows that other landforms that resemble the Face on that part of Mars isn't uncommon. The only thing that made the Face stand out from other landforms was the shadows which made it appear to have a face that looked like an egyptian pharoah.\n \n The third and final reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that the scientists would know better than any of the conspiracy theorists would so we should believe them. NASA has no reason to hide the Face from us because even if it was an alien attack, as I stated in paragraph two, it would help increase their budget. Other conspiracy theorists believe NASA is just trying to hide the proof of an alien attack but if that was what they were doing, they wouldn't have released a picture of the Face at all. Also when NASA realeased a new high resolution image in 2001 and a 3D altimetry of the Face, the landform no longer reseambled a face, which is proof that it is just a mesa.\n \n Those 3 reasons are the reasons you should believe scientists and not think it is an alien landform. NASA has nothing to hide since it would increase their budget. They also are more trained in knowing what landforms on mars are than any conpiracy theorists are. The other reason is because there are many other landforms on Earth that resemble faces which could be compared to the Face. Those 3 reasons are why we should all stop trying to make conspiracy theories and just believe what NASA is trying to tell us, that it's just a mesa.",

    ESSAY: "Long ago, Vikings spotted a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. It was about two miles long and was located on a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some people are convinced that aliens on the Red Planet, but others would beg to differ. Most scientists agree that aliens are just a myth and they did not build the \"face. Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he \"face.\"\n \n For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the \"face\" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this \"face\" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face.\" Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.\n \n Still not satisfied with my argument? If not, listen to this. With all of the new technology these days, there is even more proof as to why there was no aliens who built the \"face.\" A camera took photos of the \"face\" with maximum resolution. With the high technology cameras, scientists could look at the photo three times as large as the origianl snapshot. Becasue the scientists can zoom in so much, they would have been able to see if there were any aliens on the planet. The picture actually shows Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, which are llandforms commonly located around American West.\n \n Most scientists would agree that there never was alien life on Cydonia. Thanks to technology, this point can be proven even further. Obviously, aliens did not build the \"face\" that is on the Red Planet.",

    ESSAY: "Do you believe in aliens? In 1976 the Viking 1 spacecraft of NASA discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face! Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.\n \n The first reason why this \"face\" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.\n \n Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\n \n However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.\n \n So in conclusion the \"face\" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.",

Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the \"human Face\". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do. Nasa even had qualified scientists to make sure it was't an alien face and even confirmed it. The third reason is because on April 5, 1998 when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped pictures ten times sharper and confirmed it was just a natural landform.

In the fourth sentence it says \" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo\". Earlier in the paragraph it talks about the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, meaning the camera NASA has aren't cheap, they are high quality and could see anything that could resemble any alien life, which will be disccused next.\n \n Secondly, in paragraph 11 it talks about the cameras ablity to see anything on the ground such as shacks planes, as is I said in the previous paragraph with the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, this paragrah also says \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he added.\"So, if there objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground Egyptian- style prymaids or even small shacks, acould see what they were!\" Which brings us back to the camera being its best of class,if the camera is able to see anything on the ground that would not be visable to the naked eye, then why didn't it see anythng .\n \n I know most of you would argue that they are storing equiment in the face. But, in the picture the only holes are the eyes and the camera could of seen any other entry point at this angle.\n \n Lastly, paragraph 7 revells the picture of the face on mars, this paragraph talks about the research, and the release of the picture. Yes this eariler in the story but it all falls into place, they state they snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original picture, the image was first posted on the JPL webstite showing a NATURAL land form, no alien momument at all.

I will support my claim why I think this, and maybe you will finally believe, that there are no such things as aliens.\n \n There are many reasons why the Face is just a natural landform. On the second sentence paragraph, it says that we scientists have figured that the Face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only that this one had unusual shadows, which made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. The reason some people think it look like an alien, was because it looked like a real face, but it looks like a face, because the shadows formed on the rock give off illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth. On paragraph 7, it is said that Machael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the origninal Viking phots. Later on, thoughsands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appear. When it finally did, the site revealed a natural landorm. People were not satisfied, because it was a cloudy day on Mars. The scientists decided to prove that it was just a landform, so when it was not cloudy, they took another picture. In the final paragraph, paragraph 12, it says that what the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a btte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. A man name Garvin says, \"That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The lava dome is most of Middle Butte in the Snake Riber Plaint of Idaho.\n \n So, in conclusion, if you first thought that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, than I hope I have gave your enough information, and persuaded you that it is really just a natural landform. I am sorry if you thought it was made by aliens, but it wasn't. I hope that you could understand, and see that it was just the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.",

Other people say it was an ancient civilization on Mars. Even though only some scientist think its an alien artifact NASA made it their top prority. As they as they could they were going to gdet another photograph of the face. On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia.

Garvin sasy it reminds him of the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

    Essay: "Unmasking the face on Mars\"\n \n \"Big News\" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling\n \n Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.\n \n The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows. The (MOC) has finally released the newest picture which is 10 times sharper than any picture the Viking spacecraft could have taken, and the JPL web seach has revealed tht the face on Mars is actually just another rock formation.\n \n Even though NASA has put the picture out there that proves that the face on Mars is not acually a face but just another land formation, there are still some skeptics out there that think taht the theory is true. Skeptics have said that perhaps since on the day the picture was taken was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet that the alien marking were hidden by the haze. NASA had come to Mars to take a picture of the face at the wrong time and if they were to come another day they might have been able to see that it was an actual face and not just some rock formation.\n \n Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian. Could the butte or mesa landforms be know on other planets besides ours? We are able to get the right size because \" as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size\" so be comparing the actual size of the butte or mesa to right about the size of the Martian when we do the math. The land formation on earth reminds people most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho \" thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars\".\n \n In conclusion the Face on Mars is just another regular plain old natural landform. \" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a shack.",

    Essay: "The face is just a naturl landform by being a \" huge rock formtion\" (3) as they said in the story. They said that this is just a huge rock formation with shadows giving the illuion of the facial features. Also weater this was real or fake they still hoped it would be a good way to get mars in public attention. It most certainly did get the attention they wanted Mars to get. And if we never took those last photos what would of happen to this research project.\n \n As they told us in the story that this as probably just a huge rock formation with shadow giving it the facial feautures to make it look like a person. Some people stil dont belive NASA that that is what it is, they think alliens created that. But those people are probaly wrong becasue those people dont get close looks like NASA and dont get to go into space and look at that these things like NASA gets to do. Also no aliens would just go out on mars and make a random face there for everyone to look at. It pretty much is just a huge rock if you look at it from the pictures and you can tell that the shadows are giving its facial features.\n \n Next, this was all to hopefuly get Mars into some publicity with us and make us pay a little bit more attention now that they hade what some people think is a faec on Mars. And for everyone to try to get Mars this public attention they succeded because everyone started talking about Mars a little more. By the people talking about Mars was not just people it was Hollywod films, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunting grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. When Mars got onto the talk shows and the Hollywood films it strted to get bigger and everone start talking about it even more than they already were.\n \n Also when the Viking missions were over and the talk started to die down a little NASA went back and took more pictures of that so called face again and more closer this time. When they took the photos the first time it was Mar's cloudy month and you couldnt see the \"face\" very clear and good to get good looks at it. And that wasnt the last time the took another picture of it because on April 5, 1998 \"Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\"(7). Then after taking the such good photos they were going to upload them to a JPL web site where they had thousands of anxioius web surfers wating to see the image(7). Once they posted it and everyone got their look at it on the web site they said \" a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all\" (7).\n \n Last, after all the people though that it was a alien and NASA\n \n thought it was just a shadow NASA was right. Also maybe if we never gave Mars all the public attention you would never know if ths would happen either. And if that last picture that had been ten times better than the originals not been taken then we may not of never knew if it was a alien or the NASA research of just being a shadow.",

    Essay: "On the 24th of May in 2001, Twenty Five years ago somehting had happened around Mars. NASA sent Viking 1 to circle the planet to take picture, record data, and searching for possible lasing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. But on it voyage it spotted a figure shaped like a human face. This was a start to see if life on mars was even possible.\n \n As NASA did research on the figure they ran tests, and did many other things to collect data form the subject. They unveiled the image for people all around the world to see. And that wasnt exactly a good idea. It caused many complications and conflict. But that didnt stop us from doing more research with the figure. Yes, some scientists believed that face resembled or was an alien artifact. But our proof, such as pictures, data, and many other things object that matter. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a picture of the human faced shaped object, in the article it states\n \n \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" Thsi revaeling that NASA,\n \n The Mars Global Surveyor, and many other people have proof to disagree with the argument. But everyone has a right to have their own opinion. Even though another pitcure was taken proving that the \"artifact\" found is the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" As many other scientists have figured out.\n \n In addition to the stated proof above, many people disagree with us. The scientific facts are not enough for people to believe. So even after the pictures were taken and the evidece was proven Many were still not satistifed. Only becasue The face of Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April, producing a thin wispy layer of clouds that you had to peer through to see the face. So others controdicted and thought \"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" But they have a right to think this. But NASA and many other scientific people have took the time to find the answers. They came up with reasonable, testable answers that can be proven to be right. The face is in deed just a natural land form. I hope that the peope who are reading this can take time to reconsider the other outcomes of this shadowy human shaped face figure and think about the data and answer that were found and see what others went through to prove that their case was a true form of evidence proving what they think this figure is. Thank you. and Please reconsider, and give an effort and try to understant that the Face is just a natural landform.",

    Essay: "The \"face\" on Mars is just a natural landform. The face on Mars is nothing more than a huge rock formation and is definatly not created by aliens.\n \n The face is an amazing discovery that NASA has made when they went to Mars. The face is just a landform that can have the illusion of a face. The illusion is created by shadows giving the look of eyes, nose, and a mouth.\n \n On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture of the face that gave a much sharper look of it than the first pictures ever taken. That's when they truly discovered that the face was not a alien monument. Later they have got an even better picture. The picture shows is landforms that are like the ones around the American West.

    Essay: "Some people think that the Face is an artifact from aliens, but the fact is, it's a natural landform. Natural things happen everywhere, so seeing something that happens to look like a face should not be automaticlly assumed to be from aliens. After all, Earth has some things that look odd or familiar to our daily life! NASA is sure that this phenomenon is not from alien activity. Wouldn't you think NASA would tell us if it was?\n \n The Face is just a huge rock formation from the Red Planet. The shadows from at the angle it was taken gives it the effect of human features (3). They released the photo to \"engage the public and attrack attention to Mars\" (3). People have just gave it such an off turning idea that gives it even more attention than intended. People made such a huge deal out of it that more and more people think that there is aliens existance on Mars.\n \n For the beliefs that the fog that appeared in another photo was due to alien activity; fog happens on Earth too. If we take this even farther, it could have just been that the lens were fogged up, or the area was getting something like precipitation. I do not know for sure, but NASA has been said to have some of the most high quality equipment. I am more willing to believe that it is a fog and not a problem with the equipment (7). Although anything could break at anytime, I beileve that the fog was just a natural thing and not something overall crazy.\n \n NASA's equipment is probably more successful than many would think. If you look at one of the older pictures of the Face, you can obviously see that it is not, whatsoever, the most high caliber evidence. Looking at a recent photo may help you or others see that it is indeed a natural process happening. I believe that most who have a say in what the picture looks like, did not see what was happening in that moment in which the picture was taken. Therefore, making the guess that the lens may have broke, or the foresaken fact that it is just fog (10).\n \n In conclusion, I beilieve everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I like to think the more logical side of this debate. More and more people can do as much research as they please, but with facts know that; the Face is just a landform, that fog can happen just about everywhere, and the fact that NASA has high caliber equipment. I would like to hope that if there was a signal of alien activity, that NASA personal would tell us so we would know how to address the problem.",

    Essay: "In 1976 there was a mysterious face found on the planet Mars. I'm a scientist at NASA space station discussing some accusations about this face. Some people are beginning to believe that the face was created by aliens. However, that is not the case here. This mysterious face was simply created by natural causes and happens to just have distinct features of a human face.\n \n My first reason as to why this face is a natural landform is because there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed on Mars, or anywhere else. If there is no proof of these aliens living then how could they have possibly been able to create such an artifact. Plus, believing that this was caused by natural causes is way more believable then relying on unproven research that aliens once existed.\n \n My second reason to this being just a natural landform is scientists believe the nose,eyes, and mouth of the figure are created by shadows giving it an illusion of a human face. This attracted the public which is exactly what NASA wants. So, NASA is using the illusion of this human face to attract more attention to their program and Mars itself. By doing this it is making most people believe the face was created by aliens, which it in fact wasn't. Evidence of this is when the article, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\"\n \n My third and final reason this mysterious face is just a natural landform is that is resembles features of landforms common in American West. For example, Garvin states, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,\" Garvin also says. If this face resembles American Western landforms so much then it must be a natural landform itself.\n \n Although there are reasons this face wasn't created by aliens there are some conspiracies involving NASA. One is that people believe NASA has already found traces of life on Mars and would rather keep that sceret from the public. This is believable because NASA wouldn't want to alarm the public of extraterrestrial lifeforms and create panic. Although it could create panic, NASA should want to inform the public because it could cause support of NASA and thier findings instead. For example, people could start donating money to the company to help with further research and have more knowledge about what they do.\n \n This mysterious face on the surface of Mars is no more than a natural landform. It was not caused by aliens because there is no scientific proof. NASA wants the public to believe it is a cause by aliens so they could get more publicity for it. I mean, this face has already starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. It's had enough publicity and does not deserve anymore because of the fact that it is just a natural landform caused by natural changes, not aliens.",

    Essay: "The\" \"Face\" may look like it's a human face but it's not. Anything can make anything look drastic or cool. But there is no way that it could be a human inside of Mars. It's way to sketchy for it to be like that. So I'm gonna go ahead and tell you why I think this is why I don't think it is a human at all.\n \n The face structure hasn't changed any of those pictures. If it was human, in a couple of months or years (maybe), your body becomes rotton and turn into nun but bones. If it was human, then it would have body parts along side with it. There's no body parts near it except rocks and holes. Besides, the picture look like it was taking from a pretty far distance for the head is bigger then that boulder next to it.\n \n The fact that I know that it's not a face, notice how by years go by, the face starts looking like an sand temple. The thing with it is that on the top of it, it looks like another face on it, like a rebuilded electronic robot. But, when 2001 came by, it started looking like an a map or a super hard shell. All of these things that were on Mars looks different by the years. Now, in 2016, I bet it looks like a guided map to wear it started to wear it landed at.\n \n There's no doubt that this is just some random structure because there were no oxygen, nor water, on mars, in 1976. It's pretty much impossible to live there unless, your from NASA. Then again, there still are rumors about alien's existing. So what if there was a alien who killed an human and left it there? If you notice now, the structure of the \"Face\", how it fades away, it starts looking like an cracked shell.\n \n I want to believe that there is life on Mars, but the thing is that Mars \"probably\" have alien's there. As no one has thought about it, alien's could be legit. Just because we see a face on Mars means one thing, but the fact that it's whole entire bottom half of it's neck-to-bottom part is gone. Just because it changed up doesn't mean,\"Oh, it must have cleared up since it's been there for a while\". I doubt that because, no human being can walk on Mars with no protection on that can keep him/her alive. If your going to Mars, make sure you need a quite bit of protection. But, if you actually do see an alien, just run, because it's best staying alive instead of wind up dead in the middle of no were on Mars.",

I know that the Face of Mars didn't come from an alien because it was a humans face, they said. Aliens don't have human faces, so thats how it is a natural landform.

    Essay: "For over thirty years, the question about the Face on Mars has been posed; alien life or natural landform? Although scientists have been grilled by the media, there is only truly evidence that the Face is a natural landform, much like a butte or mesa, landforms common around the american west, despite what conspirasy theorists have to say.\n \n NASA's Viking 1 first photographed the formation in 1976, the formation described as \"An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end.\"\n \n When NASA reavealed the image to the public a few days later, claims of alien life began surfacing.

Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" The media blew up at the idea of the Face being signs of intelligent life forms on other planets, despite what the scientists had to say about what the face truly was.\n \n Eighteen years after the Viking missions ended, the Mars Global Suveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time (Cydonia is the area of mars where the face was discovered) a mars orbitor team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a matural land form, not an alien monument at all.

It is very hard work to even get a picture of the face. As it said in paragraph 9, Â“ItÂ’s not easy to target Cydonia,Â” says Garvin. Â“In fact, itÂ’s hard work.Â” Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. Â“We just donÂ’t pass over the Face very often,Â” he noted.\n \n These conspiracy theorists are looking over pictures and information that NASA discovered. It is simply illogical for someone to believe another who has made up a theory that completely goes against what NASA is putting out there. If they are smart enough to come up with a theory that is true then they would work for NASA.\n \n You cannot believe everything you read, especially online. If you are looking for solid information, go to certified websites. Let's say you do want to figure out information about the face on Mars. You go to NASA's official website. That goes for every topic. You want to look for the right information so you can be informed correctly.\n \n I hope I convinced you that the face on Mars was not created by aliens, but is just a simple natural landform. I also hope I convinced you to look for the right information for anthing you need.",

    Essay: "In 1976, the so called \"Face on Mars\" was first photographed by Viking 1. Scientists were initially surprised at the appearance of the Face, but soon concluded the it was nothing more than a Martian mesa. Some conspiracy theorists deduct that the Face signifies alien life on Mars. Life that NASA has decided to keep secret. This is incorrect. NASA would have no benefit from hiding evidence of life on Mars. The expeditions to survey the landmark cost severely. Furthermore, in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor captured a detailed photo of the Face, showing that the mysterious landmark is nothing more than a Martian butte or mesa. Also, the landmark resembles that of landforms common in the American West.\n \n The \"Face\" found on Mars lead many to conclude that Mars can in fact support life. Many also believe that NASA would rather keep this life secret. Both of these claims are false. If there truly were life on Mars, NASA would have no motivation to keep it secret. The expeditions to survey the landmark require heavy funding and millions of dollars in assets. NASA would have this issue concluded, rather than to continue to spend millions to survey the Face. There is also conclusive evidence found in pictures captured by Mars Global Surveyor that show the Face to be nothing more than a Martian butte of mesa. The photos depict the landmark as nothing special. In fact, Earth has similiar landforms found in the American West.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" is not evidence of alien life. NASA would not lie to protect evidence that could save them millions of dollars. Furthermore, the Face is simply a naturally occuring landform found on Mars. And is simliar to those in the American West. In conclusion, the \"Face of Mars\" is a naturally occuring phenomenon, not a sign of alien life.",

The article states that \"Conspiracy theorists say that the Face is evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" The thing that they do not realize is the fact that they have no proof of NASA \"making up\" a story like this.

The Martian landform is clearly a natural mesa, not an ancient civilization created by aliens, since it resembles occurances that are common in Earth's natural structure.\n \n The Martian landform is a natural occuring rock formation, since there is photo proof of it and it looks identical to mesas, buttles, and lava domes on Earth.

    Essay: "The Face? Created by Aliens or just a landmark?\n \n Did you beieve that the \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" was just created by aliens. NASA has given us many reasons to believe what they say, and not many reasons for us not believe them. I am a NASA researcher and I'm telling you why the \"Face\" is actually just a landmark.\n \n There are many reasons why the \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is a natural land form. The first reason is that NASA took three different pictures, one picture was in 1976 in the picture you can't really see anything. Scientists just thought it was another Matian mesa. At this time the cameras weren't very 3D like. So how do we know it's an actual face?\n \n The seacond reason it is a landform is because NASA\n \n sent another crew to take more pictures of the \"face.\" The crew took ten pictures that were sharper than the first one in 1976. In this picture you start to see something appear. They even say \"when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. People were not very happy when they heard it wasn't a alien monument.\n \n Another reason is that they thought alien markings were being hazed. So, when they went back it was a cloudless summer. In the text they say \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That is a huge difference from 1976. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.\n \n If you really think about it though, how come they jumped to conclusions so fast? In the passage it says it would be a good way to engage the public to Mars. Wouldn't it just attract more people to NASA to though?\n \n In many ways there are more reasons to why this \"Face\" is more of a landmark than anything. From the different years they took the years, to the landmarks being hazed. You could probably think of a lot of questions to ask NASA about the photos and what the scientists are saying, but until you go up to Mars we will only know what they are telling us. Which is that the \"face\" is a mesa. They clearly say many times in the passage for people to believe that they are not trying to trick you.",

At first this was a very succesful and popular image, a section from the article states that \" The Face On Mars has becoma a pop icon, that starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk show and even haunted stores for 25 years\". this states that this photo was a clear sign of Extarestrial life, at least at the time.\n \n Although many people beleived this theory was a Alien artifact it was eventually disproven on April 5, 1998 as shown on the article \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

NASA says that it is just a rock formation that happend naturaly. There are many arguments for both sides. I'm going to tell you the arguments from the side that says it is just a natural rock formation. This face on Mars is a natural rock formation because, if it were made by aliens than when they got close to it they would have saw things that would be unatural. Another reason is it looks like buttes and mesas that we have here in the United States. Lastly we have been studying this for twenty five years and never before has an alien came up and said, \"Hi I made this\".\n \n The first reason why I thin that this was a natural formation is that we have gotten realy close to the formation and never have we seen any aliens or even any buildings other than the face. On April 8,2001 it was a cloudless summer dday in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Â“We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,Â” said Garvin. Â“MalinÂ’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameraÂ’s absolute maximum resolution.Â” Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how close they got to the planet and they never had anything happen to the nor did they see anything. Thust proving my first point.\n \n Another reason this formation is natural is that there are formation in the United States that have naturlay occured. Buttes and mesas look very similar to the face on Mars. This is what NASA says about it ,what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West. Â“It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,Â” says Garvin. Â“ThatÂ’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.Â” This shows that there are very simmilar things to the face in our world today. Thus proving my second point.\n \n Lastly we have been studying this thing for twenty five years. NASA has been taking pictures of it for a long time now and they have not found any signs of life on Mars. Some people would say that NASA is hiding stuff. NASA would not hide stuff like this for many reasons. Here is what they say about it. The Â“Face on MarsÂ” has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showsÂ—even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on MarsÂ—evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Thus proving my third point.\n \n So in conclusion there are no signs of alien life on the planet. This is how NASA concluded there point. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This proves that even though several people think that there is life on mars there is no life and this is a natural formation.",

    Essay: "You may think that the landform that resembles a human face is proof that there is alien life on Mars, but it actually does not prove anything. There are many reasons that the mesa could be there, and alien life is the least likely. Mesas are common around the area that the face was found, and recent pictures have proved that it is just a landform. Even taking the picture on a cloudless, sunny day proved nothing. It is simply a landform, and nothing more.\n \n You might argue that it is unlikely that the landform is a mesa because it isn't natural, or that it looks unnatural. While it does look unnatrual, they are actually very common around the area that the face was found. Saying that it can't be a mesa because mesas aren't common simply isn't true. Cydonia has many mesas, the face included. There are plenty of mountains on Earth, and we all know that those aren't man-made. No one talks about one certain mountain that is man-made, while the rest aren't. Why should Mars be any different? They are all natural landforms, there isn't one that's just man made.\n \n You may also argue that the first picture was taken on a day that was cloudy, or that the picture was unclear. You would be correct, which is why NASA went back eighteen years later and took the photo again on a cloudless, clear and sunny day. The picture was taken in summer, which is generally pretty cloudless in Mars. There was practically nothing that might obstruct the view of the \"face\", and what did we find? Nothing. We found a landform, just like we had found eighteen years earlier. There was nothing to obstruct the view. That means that when we did look and find nothing, that there was nothing there.\n \n You still might not be convinced. You might say that we simply weren't close enough to find any strange alien markings, or that camera's quality wasn't good enough to see any of the strange alien markings, but that would also be correct. We took a picture of the mysterious \"face\" three times. Once in 1976, once in 1998, and finaly in 2001. Each time the picture was taken, the camera's quality was better. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters in the 1976 photo. With the image being that detailed, we would have been able to spot things as small as shacks next to the mysterious \"face\". We didn't, however. We found nothing except for the landmark, which proves that it is nothing more than an unusual landmark.\n \n In conclusion, there is countless proof that the \"face\" on Mars is nothing more than an unusal mesa. Mesas are common in Cydonia, which is where the landmark was spotted. We have taken three photos, the quality better with each, and each time nothing other than the landmark was spotted. We even went back to take the photo on a cloudless, clear and sunny day with our best camera yet, and we still found nothing. That is all the proof that I need, and it's all the proof you need. There is nothing on Mars other than an unusual landmark, that happens to look like a face.",

The face on Mars has raised the concern on whether there is life on Mars.\\ Most scientists believe that there is not enough evidence to show that there is infact life on Mars. Common people ,who disagree with scientists and other people who agree with the scientists, think there is enough evidence for life to be on mars. Life on Mars has been a very contradictory argument for many years. There has never been 100% true evidence of life on Mars. Many people just want to believe there is life.\n \n First of all, the face on Mars has never shown any pure evidence that there is alien civilization on Mars. No on has ever been on Mars' surface to check around the face to see if there actually is pure evidence to support alien existence. If life does exist on Mars, we probably would have more evidence than we do now.\n \n Next, for many years NASA and many other scientists, or even the common man, have been debating whether there really is life on Mars, or used to be. All of the pictures that scientists have now show no sign of life. If there was life, we probably would have noticed more structures around the face by now.\n \n Finally, The main reason there is a debate between common men on whether there really is life on Mars is that they simply just want to make themselves believe there is life on Mars. The convince themselves there is life. They still have no scientific facts to support their claim.\n \n In conlusion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. If there is alien life on Mars, then there is no 100% pure evidence that there is or ever was. These are the reasons why life on Mars does not exist as we know of at the moment. But there could always be new evidence that says otherwise.",

    Essay: "My argument is about how the landform is just a natural occurance. I may have proof to why it may just be another hoax N.A.S.A. may be involved in. If you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the (Face on mars) and you think what!? is that true?. I do not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a increase in technology such as photography. If you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell its not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said.\n \n My personal opinion is that it was just something to get the community aroused and it did indeed. In the passage it said \"It even haunted grocery lines for 25 years!\" and also it played its part in movies and things like that. And only recently in 2010-2016 has there been ANY proof there has been any life or there may be any life there what so ever. The reason of that is they found a river or something I can't exactly remember. And also they (N.A.S.A.) don't believe that there could be any life there because the atmosphere is so hin and so hot they believe that it would be hard for something to grow and live on the planet mars. That is why I believe it was either a hoax or a mis-understanding. Thank you very much.",

One reason I think it is just a shadow is that in the comparison pictures from 1976 to 1998 and 2001 all look different. They all give a different look on the face. Another reason i think the face on Mars is fake is, if there were civilations on mars they would also on the 3D image. So if there are no homes or shelthers there, who made it? No one did. It is a natural formation. Just like the ones in the United States of America. In the U.S.A those types of formations form in the Midwest. The formation is actualy called a butte or mesa.

    Essay: "Do you believe aliens are on mars? I am a scientist from NASA and I am here to tell you that there are no alien life forms on mars. Recently we have discovered a landform on mars that has the appearance of a human face. Many believe the face is ancient alien artifacts, and some believe it is a landform known as a Mesa or a Butte. This article will explain why this \"Face\" is not an alien artifact.\n \n About 25 years ago a spacecraft oribting mars called the viking 1 was searching for landing spots for its sister ship called the viking 2. In 1976 Viking 1 took a picture of something that had the appearnace of a face, NASA could not explain it at first. After some research that mission controllers came to the conclusion that is was another martian mesa, they were common in the region of Cydonia on planet mars. A few days later NASA decided to unveil the image for all to see. The face on mars became a huge hit in pop culture it was featured in movies, books, magazines, and even on radio talk shows. Many people begain to think the face was evidence of aliens on mars and were confused because NASA would want to hid ethe evidence of aliens on mars. \"Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars.\" Although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, Photographing Cydonia became a tp priority. NASA took pictures of the face every chance they had. In 1988 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and took good pictures of the face. When the photo was seen it was proof of no alien life it was just a landform on mars. Many were not satisfied and wanted more proof so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take more detailed pictures. When the scientist got the picture it shows a martian butte or mesa and the scientist compared it with the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of idaho in the american west. When it comes down to it there is no alien life on the planet of mars and the face is nothing but a landform with the appearance of a face. I hope this article has helped you decide if you think it is alien or a landform.",

    Essay: "This argument of the face on Mars been going on since 1976. Many people and even some scientest believe it is craftmenship of no other than aliens. Their have always been stories about how so called aliens live on the planet Mars,or how there is life on Mars. I am here to ease your mind and tell you it is no more than a mesa.\n \n Their has been alot of talk about the rocky terrian we call Mars. First off this isn't the first case of where a face has been captured. On a nother part of the Red planet there is an area called Cydonia. Their was an image of a something that resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. That was just a shadow giving the unusal look of the pharaoh. This proves that not everthing is what it seems.\n \n Next after discovering that this unusal look for Mars was just a shadow creating the illusion of having a human face we were fasinated and had to indoulge ourselvs in more reaserch. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor had gone over Cydonia. Our magnificant team of reashers got a picture that was a wopping ten times sharper than the origional photo. We had thousands of people waiting to see what was on our Red Planet it was nothing other than... a landform.\n \n Then after that find we couldn't stop there. We were so close and we were desperate to find the truth. So we had studdied the pictures,and yet still nothing. The face on Mars was no different than your common landform on earth. We were sure right there it was nothing more than a lava dome that has molded its form into an isolates mesa.\n \n Now some might say that our picture we claim that is extremly crediable could be nomore than a fluke, and there could be aliens and a chance for a new civilization on Mars. Now for us we wish there was an acient civilization on Mars, but we can't hide the truth. Finally for our picture in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, and if their was any sign of life like houses,airplanes,or even Egyptian styled pyrmids you would be able to see them. This how we know our information is credable.\n \n Now it seames the whole \" Face on Mars\" in movies, books, magazines,and radio talk shows were all false. That whole franchisement was a total bust. Now that you know the truth and the face on Mars was nothing but fraud i hope that you listen to the people down at NASA. Now i hope i have eased your mind that there are no aliens running arround.",

    Essay: "The face on Mars wasn't created by aliens, in fact it has no connection to alien life form at all! When the face was first discovered no one had really known much about it so people started hopping to conclusions before anything could be proven or tested. That is until NASA started looking into this \"face on Mars\". The face is actually a Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â” That's it- simply a rock formation but the shadows casted upon the crevices gives the strange formation the appeal of a human face. When people began to become even more skepical, on April 8, 2001, NASA had the Mars Global Surveyor draw close enough to snap another picture of the face. The day was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. NASA's serveyor camera had taken a crisp photo of the face in highest resolution. \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel.\" so you can discern things in a digital images three times better than the pixel size. So NASA, and the rest of the world, had a more clear and better picture of the face everyone was talking about. Although the face may seem strange, it could be a rather common landform for Cydonia. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" Although this one may seem to stick out from the rest, it could merely be the shadows playing tricks on the human mind. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" The landform may very well be common around Mars, it's merely the shadows ghosting around the landform that causes it to look like a face!

Many thought it was evidence of life on mars while scientist thought it was just another a natural landform. After all it was just a natural landform that was shaped like a face and shadows that made the eyes, nose, and mouth.\n \n First, Scientist just figured that it was just another Martian mesa, common around cydonia, but the only thing that was unusual was that the shadows made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But, beside the shadows they still believe it is a natural land form. So they reveiled they photo for the world to see how cool it is.\n \n But, It was taken the wrong way. Even though the said it was natural landforms, others believed it was life on mars. It became popular quickly. It was in books, magazines and even Hollywood films. Since everyone thought it was life on Mars scientist had to prove them selfs and take it one step closer.\n \n Next, scientist had to go up in Space with Mars Global Surveyor to photograph Cydonia. On April 5, 1998 the Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Carmera snapped a picture the best they could. Jim Garvin said\" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a shot.\" After looking at the photo, JPL website revealed that....it was just a natural landform.\n \n However, that did not stop the people who believed that it was a sign of life on Mars. They said \" the Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98.\" Since it was cloudy around that time of year maybe you couldn't see all the alien markings because they were hidden by the clouds.\n \n Then, Scientist decided to take a better picture with no interuptions or anything in the way. So, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia in 2001,The Surveyor captured an amazing photo. \"Malin\"s team captured an extradorinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" said Garvin. \"Each pixle in the 2001 image spans to 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meter per pixle in the best 1976 Viking photo.\"(Unmasking the Face on Mars)\n \n In conculsion, The face on Mars is a natural landform.

    Essay: "The landform on Mars is very similar to the mesas or platues of the North America's Southwest. The Face of Mars is indeed a natural ocurrance. It has been proven with some very expensive and accurate technology that it is not an alien artifact. It would be in NASA's interest to share it if it is an artifact. The first 1976 Viking photo is not creditable.\n \n The credibility of the Mars Global Surveyor has been tested twice on the Face. It took its first picture of the Face in 1998. Sceptics blamed the weather for covering up \"hidden alien signs.\" Three years later, the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture of the Face. This picture was taken with optimul weather conditions and on the highest resolution possible for that camera. The clearity showed that the Face of Mars was mearly an amazing landform, not an alien artifact.\n \n If for some absurd chance it was an artifact of some ancient alien race it would have helped NASA. They could have recieved more funds to go explore and find remenants of the alien civilization. They would have told everyone. They could make a huge profit from it. NASA could get more money from investors and taxpayers. It would have been to there benifit.\n \n The Viking 1 photo is 40 years-old. The quality of it is not near;y the same as the Mars Global Surveyor. The Face of Mars may have only been seen because of weather conditions that day. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture ten times sharper than the already 22 years-old. The Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture that was a lot clearer but still not good enough for some.\n \n In conclusion, the conspiracy theorists have no reliable information. It has been proven by the MOC and the Mars Global Surveyor that it is just a landform. The 1976 picture is too old to be reliable. All it shows is a mesa with amazing shadows. NASA probably dreams it was an artifact so they could get a budget increase. All of these points lead to one obvious answer, the Face of Mars is just a mesa on Mars.",

So, the picture was taken by accident, with not the best camera that was available. It might have been the best one at the time but better cameras were developed over time. Second, when the mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab recieved these photos on their moniters they must have been surprised but they soon figured that it was just another Martian mesa, because it was common around Cydonia, only the mesa had unusual shadows to make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Lastly, few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, so getting photographs became a main priority for NASA, about eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. So, when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it gather a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. So for those non-believers of factual evidence, the picture was revealed to actually be a natural landform. Which is why the so called Face that was created by aliens, was not created by them after all.\n \n If you don't believe me still I'm pretty sure that I have showed you all of the evidence that proves you wrong. You could try to say that the second picture was still not close enough and it was cloudy. Well, the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look, and the third picture taken in 2001 had each pixel that spaned 1.56 meters compared to the Vikings 43 meters per pixel.

It probabbly is just a level hill with a few holes or dents that would make it look like a a faceof a human. But we know its not a human face because how would people know whatwe look like. If they would look like us they would more then likely function like us too. So that would mean we clearly could go to mars too. But we can not so clearly no human like creature would make this.\n \n In conclusion we know that it is a landform. People are seeing it from a bad view or looking at it the wrong way. In the future when we have a better picture and have a better view of it we will show the world it was a landform, but it was just seen wrong.",

    Essay: "A UFO lands in your front yard. Apart from the screaming, you hear beeps and boops. You turn to the side and see an Alien standing in your doorway. He opens his mouth and a loud alarm sound comes out. You open your eyes and then realize it was all a dream. That's the only reasonable explanation for you seeing a UFO or an alien. To this day scientist have not encountered signs of life on any other planet. So what makes you think aliens could have created the face on Mars?\n \n Two decades and a half ago scientist discovered a face like shape on Mars. It was about two miles long. Scientist claimed it was staring at the cameras, but there was nothing surrounding it. No power tools, or hammers, not even a few sculpting tools. How would aliens create such a thing? With alien-y tools? Magic powers maybe? No, because it was a natural formation. Scientist figured out it was just another Martian mesa, which are frequent around the Cydonia. According to the article the only thing different about this one was that it \"had unusual shawdows make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" Which made people go wild.\n \n When Mars' face started its fifteen minutes of fame it became a beloved \"pop icon.\" It was featured in movies, books, and radio talk shows. It \"haunted grocery checkout lines\" for years. That is when people, mostly conspiracy theorists, started thinking \"What if aliens formed it?\" Some scientist even started to believe that it was an alien artificat. So more research was done. Scientist took more pictures, which were ten times sharper than the first ones, and stutdied them. Discovering, the obivious, that it was a natural landform.\n \n There was dissapointment all over the place, not only for the people, but scientist too. It was a mesa, a natural landform. It was even compared to the \"MIddle Butte in the Snaler River Plain of Idaho\". Since then the popularity of the face has gone downhill. Maybe one day it'll resurface on the social media as a funny meme that teens will talk about for two weeks. Tragic.",

Either way I think it is a natural landformation.\n \n People many have a strong theory, but it many not always make sence. The Face on Mars is a total natural landformation. NASA's scientist have not found any signs of aliens on the planet Mars. The article states that not many scientists believe that there was an alien artifacts on Mars. Scientists also say that it is hard to track Cydonia and to get a clear image on the face.\n \n The face has to be a natural landformation because most of the wierd landforms on Earth may look like ancient aliens did it but it was not. Scientists have not proved that aliens are real and that all wierdly amazing artifacts are from them. Aliens are not real although there are shows about them being real, but those are all conspiracies. The conspiracies may look real and sound real but they are just trying to get people's attention to hear them out and to convice them that aliens are real.\n \n Scientists say that our minds are tagated to find faces in objects. We see all kinds of shapes in the cloudy skys because our minds are trained to do that. The Face on Mars is just one of the many things that we can find a face in a natural landformation. The article states that the landforms are also common near the American West on Earth. Garvin says \"It reminds me mosr of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n In conclusion, there are big conversations about the Face on Mars. Some many think it is an ancient alien formation, but others say it is a natural landformation. Scientist have a hard time tracking down Cydonia and also taking pictures of the face. Aliens have not been proven to be out in outerspace, so therefore it cannot be an alien formation. This Face on Mars is an natural formation because there are similar landformation on Earth near the American West and also in Idaho. Whether it is an alien formation or a natural one I am saying that the Face on Mars is just another natural fanominon.",

    Essay: "For years, many people have argued with scientists (at NASA) that the Face on Mars is alien made. Conspiracy theorists and most of the general public are set on believing that the Face is an ancient alien artifact. But, NASA has reliable evidence to back up and prove that the Face is just a fascinating natural landform.\n \n First off, you cannot argue with the pictures that were taken of the Face. Even from the first picture ever taken of the landform in 1976, scientists were able to conclude that the Face was just another Martian Mesa, that just resembled a human face, specifically an Egyptian Pharaoh. In this photo, there was no evidence of any alien markings on the structure.\n \n On the other hand, conspiracy theorists and skeptics argue that the picture isn't clear enough for someone to make out any markings on the landform. So, in 1998, another photo was taken of the face. It was ten times sharper than the original Viking photo, and it still revealed only just a natural landform. People still weren't satisfied and pressed on though, arguing that the picture was taken on a cloudy day and the haze in the photo blocked out any special markings or evidence. But then a couple years later in 2001, scientists got another image of the Face on a clear day with the camera's absolute maximum resolution, (and you would be able to see any objects or markings that was there) and there was still no signs of markings indicating alien interaction.\n \n Also, the face is just another Martian Mesa, a natural landform. I will say it is a fascinating landform, but it is still natural. The Face resembles natural landforms found common in the American West, like buttes and mesas. It especially looks similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that yes, it is possible to have natural landforms like the Face, and it is comparable to some of the landforms we have here on Earth.\n \n In conclusion, there is multiple credible sources to back up scientist's (at NASA) claim that the Face is just a natural landform. There are a few different photos of the structure, each photo having higher resolution and being easier to make out than the previous one. With all three photos, there is no evidence of any special markings or objects that would suggest or prove of alien life. Also, there are similar landforms like the Face here on Earth so it's not like it is a freak of nature that nobody could ever see how something so interesting was made; it's comparable to things here even in America. Even with all of the conspiracies, NASA has reliable and credible sources to prove that the Face is just a natural landform.",

A Martian mesa is like a sand dune it is mound of sand and dirt, so for this to be a alien artifact is very unlikely. These mesas are very common on mars, because it says,\"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.\" This shows that it was just another mound of sand and dirt that had a wierd shadow that made it look like a face.\n \n The second piece of evidence is that, the picture quality was not very clear in the first two pictures. In the first picture they did not have very high HD cameras like they did in 2001. In the first picture it is very blurry and not clear witch gave it the look of a face. In the second picture it was a cloudy day and the picture did not come in clear, still giving it the look of a face.

    Essay: "Many people may believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, but research claims it's something not as exciting. NASA has been researching this \"face\" for many years. Their studies and pictures have concluded that the Face on Mars is a huge rock formation. Even though scientists have proved this theory, people still believe otherwise. It all started in 1976 when NASA unveiled the image for all to see.\n \n NASA found a huge landform made of rock on Mars in 1976. The landform was found on a region of Mars called Cydonia. This landform came as a surprise to everyone. Large rock formations were common in this region of Mars, but something stood out to NASA when they came across this rcok formation. This landform looked like a giant face. Scientists didn't know if it was an alien artifact or if the shadows and the way the rock formed just made it look like a face. There was no way to tell other than the photo's taken from space. NASA had to keep investigating this to come up with an explanation for this \"face\" on Mars. So in 1998 they took another picture of the rock formation that was better quality. They still couldn't tell what it was because it was very cloudy on Mars the day they took the picture. They had one more shot to get a good image of the landform. In 2001, NASA took one last picture and they found out what the rock formation really was.\n \n Just as they had predicted, it was a mesa. Which was common for the area on Mars where they found it. Even though scientists knew it was a mesa, conspiracy theorists still believed it could be an alien artifact. There are many signs that prove that this rock formation is not an alien artifact. First of all scientists have ruled it out as an alien artifact. They have done research on this \"face\" for over 20 years and they have proved it's a huge rock formation. People have always wondered how and why the face appears if it's a mesa. Well the face is created by shadows. These shadows give the illusions of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Scientists have also told us that things in a digital image are 3 times bigger than their actual pixel size. This tells us that if there were some type of pyramid, alien object, or airplanes on the ground we would be able to see them.\n \n The Face on Mars will always be a controversy to some people, but scientists have proof of what the face actually is, a mesa. The pictures you see are actually showing a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. These rock formations are commonly found on Mars and on Earth. So even if you still believe the Face of Mars is an alien artifact of some kind, you can at least know Earth and Mars have something in common, huge rock formations.",

    Essay: "Certainly there are many different opinions about the Face found on Mars. Some people believe the Face was made by aliens, while other people believe it is a natural landform. I strongly believe that the Face is a natural landform because there is scientific evidence to prove that a landform could be formed on Mars and there are similar landforms like the Face on Earth.\n \n First of all, there is scientific evidence that proves landforms can form on Mars.\n \n For example, scientists have found that mountains, canals, and volcanoes have formed on Mars. Scientists have also found that Mars, like Earth, has tectonic plates. Tectonic plates cause many different landforms to form when they shift and move around. If tectonic plates create landforms on Earth that no human can, it should be reasonable to think that tectonic plates can be the cause of landforms on Mars.\n \n Secondly, Mars has similar landforms to the landforms on Earth. Just like Earth, Mars has volcanoes, mountains, and canals. Scientist have found that tectonic plates are the cause of many of the landforms we see on Earth today. For example, mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push against each other, trying to push the opposing plate underneath. If none of the plates budge, the plates will begin to push each other up tho form mountains. For canals to form, water would have to run over the land for a while and erode the rocks until a ditch forms. Even though there isn't water on Mars now, scientist have proved that water has once been on Mars. Since water and tectonic plates cause landforms on Earth, the same elements must cause landforms on Mars as well.\n \n Even though I believe that the Face is a natural landform, many other people will disagree with that statement. Many people with opposing viewpoints from mine will say that aliens built the face. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence to even prove the existence of aliens. Secondly, the pictures from the space crafts show no sign of any civilization near by the Face. On Earth, we may have ancient Pyramids that weren't formed naturally, but there were civilizations around those pyramids. Around the Face on Mars there is no sign of any villages or aliens living there. With a Bird-eye view, the face does't seem to have any human facial features. Only when there is a shadow, the features of a human being appear. This makes the Face seem like it was just a coincidence that it had terestrial features. With the lack of evidence to support the claim that aliens made the Face on Mars, it is hard to believe that such an idea could be true.\n \n In conclusion, I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because there are landforms on Earth that are the same as those on Mars and those landforms were made from tectonic plates and water. I believe that you look at the evidence provided to you before you draw any conclusions.",

Since the discovery of the form, it has been in movies, books, and radio talk shows. Some consipiracy theorists say that the form was actually created by aliens, but why would we want to hide the fact that there is life on Mars when in reality it would benefit here at NASA. The landform is Martian mesa formation much like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.\n \n The Martian mesa is the term used for the landform.

In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face. There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago. In the article it says that the camera that was used to capture the 1976 photo only had 43 meters per pixel, in other words meaning that there's almost no way in telling what the first picture was or resembled.\n \n In 1998 and 2001, you can see the picture more clearly due to the advancement in technology you clean clearly see that there is no outline or resembalance of a face. The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa. In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud. When the photographs began to be released online there was many observations but many realized it was infacr not a face.\n \n After all the questions blew over, Directors began putting images and shots into movies which again started raising talk. In movies or films there are special effects people that are able to enchance photos and clips. So most of the photographs and clips are not actually NASA recorded and theres a good chance most of them had been edited to make more money on a film or movie because people want to know more about myterious things like this.\n \n Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa.

Later on in the years it doesn look like a face but im gonna disagree on it wasnt created by aleins it is just a natrual landform.\n \n That was my argument on aleins did not creat the face that it is just a natrual landform. It formed into looking like a face but didnt right when someone first saw it so there for how could any know it was suppose to be a face like i said. It just shaped into one over the years. Then people wanna make an opinion that is on aleins creating it. I think it is just a natural landform.",

    Essay: "My friend Brynna thinks that the \"Unmasking the Face on Mars.\" was done by aliens, but the other hand I dont think it was. The first photos looks like an alien but they were taken long long ago, but the pictures today are way sharper and shows us more detail about them. On paragraph 7 it states, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all\"(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 7). Basically it was just a landform that looks like a face.\n \n Also the artical states that the weird looking mask looks like landforms common around the American West, it states on paragraph 12, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American west\"(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 12).\n \n Brynna states from paragraph 5,\" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA\n \n would rather hide, say conspiracy theorist\"(Unmasking the Face on Mars, paragraph 5).\n \n But you have to think about the citizens, would you really want to know if aliens do exist or not? Not knowing is stress free and just makes the world a better place. But if you know you'd freak out every day of your life thinking aliens can come down any day now. Not knowing everything is a good thing sometimes and not knowing what NASA is hiding is a good example.\n \n So knowing that the pictures they have are real pictures, it is a landform. My text evidence in my first three paragraphs will give you the reasons why \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" is a landform and not a face.",

    Essay: "Brock was walking in the woods along the creek. At the edge of the water, he saw something that made a body type figure. Brock went down to see if it was a body, but when he got down there, it was really hard to see if it was a body because of the running water. He went back up to where he saw the body, and he coud see it clearly again. He took a picture of the body figure and sent it to the Elkart County Lab. They went to take a look at it and they posted the picture sent from Brock online. Most of the people who saw it, including some of the scientist, thought it was some sort of alien figure. They dug it out and found it to be a rock formed into a body shape by the shadows of the water, and the erosion that has been done to the rock. I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it isn't an alien formation, you can see what it is made of, and there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real.\n \n One example that proves my claim is that the author explains in the excerpt that it isn't an alien formation. The author states that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed that it was just a natural landform, not an alien monument. The author also states that it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n Another example that demonstrates my claim is that according to the author, you can see what it is made of. The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, \"as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n A final example that proves my claim is that the author demonstrates that there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real. The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.\n \n Now I hoped I gave you enough information to convince you that the Face is just a natural landform, and not created by aliens.",

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens due to it's common landform shade.\n \n Mars Global Surveyor was used to take pictures of Mars. The picture showed the Face was the equivalent to the size of a butte or mesa. Butte or mesas are common landforms around the American West. A famous one is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\n \n Martain mesas are very common around Cydonia. Cydonia is a region of Mars. It is not uncommon for a rock formation to resemble something like a face. The shadows on Cydonia gave the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth on the natural rock formation.\n \n People who support that the Face was created by aliens believe that there is life on Mars and that NASA is hiding this information. This is not true. NASA wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Life on Mars would be great business for NASA and they would have no reason to hide it from the public.\n \n The first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Eighteen years later, Mars Global Surveyor landed on the Red Planet. The technonlogy was way more advanced now.

    Essay: "The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and does not prove that there is alien life on Mars. The Face was created simply by poor camera quality and an optical illusion. The later pictures of the Face taken in 1998 and 2001 prove this theory even further. If you look at the later pictures, you can clearly see that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation. NASA is also in support of finding alien life, so they would have no reason in trying to disprove that aliens are not real. So, the face is nothing more than an optical illusion, and not something created by aliens.\n \n The Face on Mars is nothing more than an optical illusion and a natural formation working together. If you look at the picture of the Face from 1976, then it is very convincing proof that the face was the work of aliens. However, the picture of the Face that was taken in 2001 shows that the Face is simply a rock formation with shadows where the eyes and mouth should be. This is also proven with the picture that was taken in 1998. Even though there is clouds over the Face, you can still tell that there is no alien creation in the picture. Garvin brings up a comparison of the Face to a \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" which is a \"lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" By drawing this comparison, it gives us something we can easily compare the Face to on Earth. People don't claim that the \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain\" was created by aliens, yet it is easily comparable to the Face.\n \n Alien life on Mars would support NASA. It would bring great attention to the space program, and more funding. If NASA were to find aliens, they wouldn't hide it from the public. Whenever the picture was first taken in 1976, NASA released it to the public only a few days after it was taken. Although the picture had a theory to disprove that it was the creation of aliens along with it, NASA still released it almost immediatly. This is proof that NASA is in support of finding alien life becuase they were not afraid to release something that could possibly prove it. Even after NASA ended the Viking missions, they still went back to take more photos of the Face. This would either prove the conspiracy theorists even more, due to advancments in technology which would allow for higher resolution photos, or it would prove NASA's theory that shadows were creating the optical illusion. The pictures helped the case of the latter. Because of how much clearer the picture taken in 1998 is compared to the picture taken in 1976, you are able to see much more detail of the Face, and can easily tell that it is just a mesa. Conspiricy theorists claimed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze in the picture, which would later be disproved by the very clear picture taken in 2001. So, if NASA were not in support of finding alien life, why would they release three pictures that could possibly prove alien life?\n \n In conclusion, the face was not created by aliens. NASA is also not trying to hide any evidence for alien life on Mars, so if this were the creation of aliens, NASA would fully support it. NASA released three photos of the Face, all which had the possibility of proving that it was the creation of aliens, yet they still released them. So, if NASA wanted to hide alien life, why would they release anything to hint at it?",

In 1976 it looked like a shadow face. 1998 it had a white tent to it. 2001 it had racks like a rock.

    Essay: "On May 24, 2001 something strange happened on Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft circled the planet, looking for possible landing sites for Viking 2, when it captured a human face lurking on the ground of Mars. An enormous head seemed to stare back at the cameras from Cydonia. The NASA scientists soon found out it was not an alien marking. The Face is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa.\n \n To begin, The Face natural landform is not the only Martian mesa in Cydonia. This region of Mars is actually quite common for having these weird Martian mesas. This mesa was different from the others with \"unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh(2).\" This information led to the research of an ancient civilization on Mars. The research found that there was not an ancient civilization, although many people wish their would have been.\n \n Since many people wanted to find an ancient civilization, conspiracy theorists hoped to prove NASA wrong. The theorists began to throw false accusations at NASA including, \"Some people think the Face is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists(5).\" NASA defenders stated that they wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars and that they would not lie. NASA flew over Cydonia once again and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the originial Viking photos. The picture proved that it was just a natural landform. This didn't stop the conspiracy theorists from pushing forward.\n \n To conclude, the theorists believed that since there was a haze on Mars when they took the photo, that the haze could potentially hide ancient Martian markings. This kept NASA pushing harder into their research. \"Neverless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look(10).\" NASA rolled the spacecraft to center the Face in the field of view. They took a picture with extraordinary resolution. If anyone could see anything they could see it. NASA concluded that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa- landforms commonly found in the American West.\n \n The Face is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. The trips NASA took around Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform commonly found in Cydonia. The Face is a giant rock plated with shadows for eyes, nose, and a mouth. Consiracy theorists still may believe that their was an ancient cicilization, but NASA indeed showed them wrong. The Face will always remain a great landform discovery on Mars.",

    Essay: "The face on Mars is not an alien artifact. I believe it is just a landform, and here's why, there has been photos that have been taken since the original 1976 photo that said that it was a face. What the 2001 photo has shown us is that it is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte or a mesa are common around the American West. JIm Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program had said that it \"eminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.\" Secondly, I believe that it is a landform because NASA has photographed this photo more than once to determine if it was an alien atrifact and after their second trip to Cydonia, they had enough information to say it is a martian landform. So in 1998, they had waited nearly eighteen years since the first photos of the face. The research crew took a new photo of the face that is ten times sharper than the 1976 photo. When it was released to the public, it had turned out to be a natural landform, not an alien monument. Lastly, I believe it is a nautral landform because in the 2001 photo of the landform, the Mars Global Surveyor took a new photo of the face using the camera's maximum resolution \"Each pixel spanned 1.56 meters, while the 1976 photo had spanned 43 meters. So, this abolishes the possibility of it being an alien artifact because if there were any egyptian style pyramids you would have been able to see them\" These are the facts that I believe determine that the face on mars is just a landform and not an alien artifact.",

    Essay: "We all know there are 7 wonders of the world, but could this be the first wonder of the universe. Nature can make some astonishing things. Many things in the world, or even the universe, are nature-made. They have been here since the beginning of time even though they seem to be man-made. The \"Face\" should be included in this category. This \"Face\" was created by natural processes.\n \n Similar to the \"Face\", places on Earth are nature-made. Even though sand dunes on beaches are kept by humans, they were first nature-made. Sand storms on Earth create higher dunes in deserts because the starting dune blocks the sand from getting across it. This may be what caused the \"Face\" to be created. There may have been an oval shaped dune at that spot, and, then, a \"storm\" passed by. The beginning dune blocked the Mars sand from exceeding that barrier, and the \"Face\" we see now was created. The shadows forming the eyes, nose and mouth were created on accident.\n \n Sometimes landforms are created when objects collide with planets. The \"Face\" could have been formed when a meteor crashed into Mars. Only this time the crash did not create a crater, but instead a protruding object that over the years got rounded out by storms. Evidence does not suggest that every single meteor strike causes a crater. The reason that craters are an effect on Earth may be due to Earth's atmosphere or it's magnetic field. This may just be the first time NASA has ever seen a mound created by a meteor strike. There could be more out in the universe that NASA hasn't observed yet.\n \n In April of 1998, a photo was taken that was blury due to Martian clouds. Many people exclaimed that the clouds may have blocked some alien markings. When NASA took another photo in April of 2001, the photo does not seem to portray any alien markings. Furthermore, the \"Face\" looked as though it has cracked on the side. Suggesting that there are Martians on Mars and, along with that, there were Martians that made this \"Face\", why wouldn't the Martians fix their monument when it cracks. This led me to believe that not only did the \"Martians\" on Mars not build this, but, additionally, there are no Martians on Mars.\n \n Others may say that, comparative to the Mound Builder Indians on Earth, the \"Face\" was created by Martians bringing dirt to one spot and creating that \"mound\". If that was the case, then how come, in all of the photos and evidence we have from Mars, NASA has never once seen a Martian. They might be hiding from us, but, like Humans, couldn't Martians have messed up, and they forgot to hide one time.\n \n This \"Face\" is created by natural processes. Even though it has been extremely controversial over whether it is alien-made or nature-made, more evidence suggests that the \"Face\" is nature-made. Many things in the universe can cause a mound on a planet, but finding out which one is the cause of the \"Face\" may never be known.",

I do believe that this face is a natural landform because the picture quality back then was not all too great, this place is known for it's \"Martian mesa's\", and they only unveiled it to the general public for attention and hopefully more money in their funding.\n \n I believe that this \"face\" so to speak is actually just another lanform on the terrain that is Mars. I believe that it is a landform becase as you can see the picture quality in 1976 is much more different than the quality of the picture in 2001. That said, Mars is known for it's powerful windstorms, so the earth could have shifted over time. That just makes it even more of a landform though.\n \n I also believe that this so called \"face\" is not an actual face because the scientists stated that in the region of Cydonia it was common to find what they call \"Martain mesas\" which means it just so happens to be another freaky concidence instead of some actual huge martian face. Not even the actual scientists believed that it was an actual martian. They did think so for a short while and they're honestly dumb. In my opinion, until the day where some other form of life comes down to Earth, there is no such way there could be martian life.\n \n I believe that this isn't an actual face also because NASA unveiled it to the general public just for attention and possibly some money. Let's face it, NASA doesn't get very much funding. I'm guessing that they unveiled it to the public for attention saying \"look at me, look at me I'm some important Martian face and you should give the people who found me more money so they can find other things like me with better equipment.\" Which in my opinion it's just plain sad. Don't get me wrong I support NASA all the way, but when they have to do something like this just to get fame and perchance a little bit of money, it's a little sad.\n \n We all know that with more fame comes more money (let's not talk about Kanye West shall we?) There are people like Selena Gomez and Donald Trump who have so much money from all the fame they're getting. When in reality they aren't contributing much to society except for the fact that they are just spewing a lot of junk out of their mouths. Whereto people working at places such as NASA have not very much funding and are still attempting to change the world, which is really really beautiul.\n \n In the end, this \"face\" is nothing but a silly little landform on the face of Mars. I still firmly believe it because the picture quality back then was not all too great, this place is known for it's \"Martian mesa's\", and they only unveiled it to the general public for attention and hopefully more money in their funding. This is the sad truth in this whole operation, but it is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

    Essay: "What is your view on the \"Face of Mars?\" This is a very interesting topic. There are many different points of view for the \"Face on Mars.\" Although, there are two main concepts. The first is based off of research. Many people at NASA believe in this point of view. The people that believe this idea is true and think that the face is just a natural landform. The second is based off of conspiracy. This idea is based off of external life outside of Earth. The people that believe in this point of view think that aliens have created this landform.\n \n I myself believe in the research part of the concept. There is just not enough physical evidence to say that it is aliens. This is just an idea that many conspiracy theorists believe. Sometimes their theories can be a little enticing, but they never really have any evidence to back up any of it. The idea of aliens making this lanform had been created by some \"very creative\" minds and was probably thought of when the pictures weren't high enough quality to make anything out of them.\n \n Now lets say that there are aliens living on Mars. In order for them to make this landform, they would have to know about humans. They would have to know what a human face looked like. They would also have to know that we are smart enough to be studying them and they would have to be smart enough to study us. The chances of them finding out all of this information without ever getting recognized by anybody are slim to none. Again, it all coms back to research. There is no evidence of aliens. Therefore, nobody can argue that this landform was made by life outside of Earth.\n \n Now personally, I agree with the scientists that had first discovered this \"Face on Mars.\" This is just merely another Martian Mesa. The odd shadows are common around Cydonia and it just happened to be an odd combination of them. I honestly think that is all there is to it.\n \n Now what do you believe? Do you think it is an alien artifact? Or is it just a natural lanform? I hope this persuaded you to think on the more scientific side of things, because trust me it will help you in the long run.",

However, it is really a face?\n \n NASA declared the \"face\" to actually be a martian mesa. Although, some people believe that it is a face that was made by aliens.\n \n Scientists believe that the \"face\" on Mars is actually a landform. According to paragraph seven in the article, \"Thousands of anixous web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform.\" NASA had a picture to prove that it was not an alien monument.\n \n NASA\n \n had also compared the martian mesa to other mesas around the western United States, according to paragraph twelve in the article. NASA had also mentioned that the pictures in the past had worse resolutions than the ones we have today, which can be one of the main factors of having the martian mesa look like a face.\n \n NASA had taken the first picture of the \"face\" in 1976 and the last one in 2001. Over the years, NASA has spent lots of money on this project. All of their hard work and money has paid off. Due to their large interest, they were able to figure out that the \"face\" was a martian mesa. Their huge discovery led to learn about landforms on Mars. They had sucessfully unmasked the \"face\"\n \n of mystery on Mars.",

    Essay: "Have you ever seen somthing, but it was not really what you thought it was? I'am a scientist at NASA, and i am trying to explain that the face that everyone saw on the planet Mars was not created by aliens. It was created by naturel landform. There are many clues that the face was created by natural landform. Also many people can disagree with me, but I will prove to you that it was not created by aliens.\n \n Many people thought that the face was created by aliens because at the time they did not have much eveadince of it was real or not. They thought that unusal shadows made it look like an Egyptin Pharaoh. We then showed people the pictures of the so what called face. It became a big hit everywhere, and people loved it. Some people thought it led to maybe living things being there. It then became an acient civlazation on mars.\n \n In about April 5, 1998 they sent another ship out to take more adavnced pictures. These fine pictures would be much sharper, and they would capture more evedince. 1,000s of people waited to see what the fastinting pictures would bring a new. It revealed a natural landform and there came to be no alien monument after all. Many people were disapointed. They wanted to belive that it was real. Well, I am here to tell you that it is not real.\n \n As you can tell there was a lot of dispute going on. Some people did not want to belive that it was not real. They wanted to keep trying. They then wanted to take a second look. The poeple wanted to make sure that we did not miss anything. We had an extraordinary photo that had pixel spans that were 1.56 meters. That was much better compared to1976 when the yfirst took the picturses.\n \n What the picture actually showed was land forms that were common around the Amercian West.\n \n Now do you see why the face was not created by aliens. Yes, maybe at one point in time it seemed like it could of been real, but all in the end it was not. It just took a little explaning and evidence over the photographs. In my opoion it would have been pretty amazing to of been that way. I guess some things just do not happen like that, and maybe some things happen for a reason. With my helpful eveidence and my clues I hope that you now understand why the face was not created by aliens, but why it was created by the natrual landforms.",

According to the text,\"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\"\n \n Second, when we took a picture of the Face in 1976. It was because of the weather that it looked like a face. Another reason is because of the angle that we took a picture in. It might also have been the camera.

    Essay: "In 1976, a single image of Mars taken by a NASA spacecraft blew the world's mind. It depicted a gigantic face on Mars. Of course we understood that people would be shocked. In fact, we told the public that it was only a natural formation, and the conspiracy theorists came along with their new story. They accused us of hiding the fact that there was an alien civilization on the Red Planet, and that the picture is a monument. All we want to do here at NASA is inform skeptics that they are severely mistaken.\n \n First of all, we revealed the information because we wanted the public to be informed, and we wanted to not hide anything. All the skeptics should stop and realize that us revealing partial information is just illogical. If we revealed the picture, it's because we wanted people to know about it. As we said earlier, the face-type shape is \"formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" We gave you the full truth.\n \n As well as us giving you full information, we actually would be glad to tell the public about ancient martian civilizations. NASA would benefit greatly from something like that. You see, we aren't getting funded as well as we would like. So something as interesting as alien life-forms would definitely get us more money to explore more. Simply put, the public's thirst for exciting information would drive the government to fund us. Unfortunately, the face is just a creation of nature, but we'll be more than glad to inform you if we ever find signs of alien life.\n \n In addition to the fact that NASA is always glad to provide information, we took very clear pictures that show just a desolate mound of rock that is naturally made. We took three pictures of the face. One was in 1976, the next in 1998, and the last in 2001. Jim Garvin (of NASA) explained that the newest pictures would show things such as man-made pyramids and villages. Of course, those would prove the face to be man-made as well. However, such things aren't seen in any of the pictures.\n \n Overall, we know that there will always be people that don't believe in the facts. However, there is solid evidence (such as witnesses and pictures) to back us up. They all point to the \"face\" being a natural formation. I hope that this essay has helped eliminate doubt in the public. Just remember, NASA is glad to inform you of any signs of alien life when we find it.",

Your first instinct might be that it was made by aliens or creatures we have never seen. Well, this did happen; in 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was flying over Mars and they stumbled upon what looked like a humans face, but they were not positive what or why it was there. This Face is just a natural landform because scientists proved it, there was no sign of abnormal activities, and mesas are not unusual in Mars.\n \n This Face is a natural landform because scientists proved it was not made by aliens. The author states, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonai for the first time Micheal Malin and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows how the Face was only a landform. \"The text states, \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view' said Garvin. 'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each Pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This exemplifies how scientists used advanced technology to take an accurate picture of the Face. What they found was that it was a mesa.\n \n Again this shows how scientists took advanced pictures and all they saw was a natural landform.\n \n Furthermore, there was not any abnormal activity to prove it was aliens. Gavin said, \"As a rule of thumb you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" This shows how the camera was powerful enough to have shown if it was really an alien monument. Similarly, Gavin states, \"So, if there were objects on this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" This adds on to the idea that if there had been an alien civilization they would have been able to capture anything that was out of the normal.\n \n Additionally, these landforms are not unusual on Mars. Infact, there are similar landforms on planet Earth. The article states, \"Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.\" This shows how mesas are common in Mars, and they are not strange to be seen. Furthermore, the text states, \"What the picture shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolate mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'\" This exemplifies how these landforms are not just in Mars, but also on planet Earth. However, this specific landform had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but the picture tooken byThe Mars Global Surveyor proves that it was a natural landform. This camera took a picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\n \n Clearly, the Face on Mars was just a mesa. There was no explanation found of how it could have been formed by aliens. First, there was no evidence found that it was an alien artifact; cameras proved that it was a landform. Plus, mesas are not unusual in the planet Mars. The Face seen on the Mars was another one of Mother Nature's ability to create spectacular scenes in the landscape.",

Plus if it was alien why would NASA publish the pictures. If this was proof of aliens it would put people into freak out mode.\n \n The first thing is that giant rock formations aren't uncommon in the cydonia section of Mars. In fact there are a whole bunch of different kinds of rocks just like the face, only that those are normal looking. They don't look like faces. The article even says that the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Even Garvin says ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'' then he keeps going to say ''That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.''\n \n The second thing is close up images. Over the years NASA has been taking pictures of this formation. Each time they take a picture of face, the face starts to look more and more like a rock formation. NASA even publicly posted pictures on the web, and all diferent kinds of media to show what the formation looks like. So, NASA must of been pretty confident in what they were saying the picture was. Plus NASA is made of the top of the line professionlas. They aren't made up of people who dropped out of highschool. They are made up of people who have graduated from some of the most advanced and instutionalized colleges.\n \n My third thing is if it was alien, why would NASA publicly show the pictures. In the article, it makes NASA look like they were trying to get people to get away from the alien idea. By the sound of it, I would take a guess and say if it was alien, NASA would do everything in their power to keep the images from getting out into the public. Another thing is that at one point people were saying that the picture taken on April 5, 1998, was not liable because of the fact that 98 was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. So, NASA on April 8, 2001, took another photo in the year 2001 and 2001 was not a cloudy year for the Red Planet .The photo even further backed up the fact that the formation on Mars is just another giant rock, not some alien face or artifact.\n \n So in the end why would this be an alien face or aritfact. NASA has publicly proven that it is just a formation of rocks and dust/sand. Plus if NASA didn't wan't us to know about aliens or anything of the sort, why would they publicly anounce and show pictures of the Face of Mars. That is why the Face of Mars is not related to anything alien at all and is just another formation in the cydonia sector of Mars.",

    Essay: "Mars has many landforms, but there is a particular one that is peculiar. The landfrom is known as The Face. The Face was spotted by a space surveyor in 1976 and has been a mystery to the world ever since. Some people say that this landform was made by alien life on Mars, but with facts from NASA and other sources you could see that those people are wrong.\n \n The Face has had many theories made up about how it was made and if it is even real. One of these theories is about how or who created it. This theory is about how NASA is hiding the fact that the face was made by some type of alien lifeform, which logically makes no sense at all. Finding life on another planet would bring in a gargantuan amount of money for NASA so it would seem completely illminded to hide something like this from the people. NASA can only wish they knew about an alien lifeform.\n \n With this new discovery people and scientists demanded for more proof on how it was made. Throughout the knowing of this landform three pictures were taken of it. The first of pictures was in 1976 when they first found it and camera quality was not very good. With not a clear image, and the need for answers, NASA sought out for another picture and got one during a cloudy winter day in 1988. This picture did come out clearer than the other but still was not perfect for scientist and people to be one-hundred percent sure how it was made. So the wait began to get another picture. Finally in two-thousand-one NASA used a new, high-resolution, three-dimensional camera to take an outstanding clear photo of what they concluded to be a mesa, common in the American West, just with the physical pheatures of a human face.\n \n In conclusion this outstanding land form on Mars had the world stuck asking this question, \"Is there alien life on mars?\" The Face was a mystery to science for almost thirty years only to be proven to be just another landform on Mars. To conclude, this landform is nothing more than a naturally occuring lava dome.",

    Essay: "The solar system has many interesting planets and those planets have many interesting landmarks. The Face on Mars just happens to be one of them. The face was found in a region of Mars called Cydonia. I feel as though it is a coincedence that a natural landmark on our neighborring planet looks like a human face. Many people say that The Face on Mars is just a legend, but we have scientifical proof of a face on Mars. The Face on Mars isn't an alien creation, but it is a natural landmark.\n \n The Face on Mars is a natural landmark. It's a natural landmark because not only has it been there for a long time, but over the years we have found that it is a natural landform not an alien monument(JPL website). Many Hollywood movies have used the term \"that face on Mars,\" but many people think that the face is evidence of life on Mars. Some scientists have compared the face to landmarks in the USA called buttes or a mesa. Many people also say that the face resembles an Egyptian Pharoah.\n \n On the other hand, some people specifically NASA has used The Face on Mars as a way to show that some things are important for taxpayers to see. Like I mentioned before Hollywood has made many big selling movies about The Face on Mars. Also, many books and magazines have used The Face as a headliner. Some NASA defenders has said that they wish there was some sort of an ancient civilization on Mars to use as a motive.\n \n The Face on Mars is a cool natural landmark. It was located in Cydonia an area of Mars. The Face isn't a legend at all. There is real scientific proof of a face. The Face on Mars isn't a hoax either. Many people think that it is a legend and a hoax, but it is a real natural landmark. The Face on Mars is not an alien creation, but it is a natural landmark. It deserves some attention.",

No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die.\n \n Well I have something to say. Aliens do not exist. If they were real, they would have took over the world. They would have been making us do work every single day. f they came here they would probaly have killed us by now. Have they killed us, have they started making us do work? No, they haven't.\n \n Grayson? Yes, Sir? I heard you and Kevin talking about how aliens made that face on mars. Both of you are wrong. You were right about the no aliens part, but everything else was wrong. We just now figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. It is common enough in Cydonia. When we took the picture, I have got a lot of e-mails saying \"what is that thing?\" I even got a e-mail from Michael Bay saying that he is going to use that image for a movie. This stuff is crazy!\n \n Thats awesome sir! Wait, Grayson there is more. The picture is accually the Martian of a butte or mesa. It's common across the American west.

It has also been put in haunted grocerey store check out lines. All of that is just to draw attention. All though it did they just want you to think that because they wanted money.\n \n Sence people thought that the face was an alien artifact N.A.S.A made photographing it a main priority. On a JPL website they revieled that the face was a landmark and nothing more. The face on mars was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it was winter. This was a cloudy time on the planet mars. It may have messed with the picture a little bit anyway.\n \n Some mission controles prepared to look again. It's very hard to locate the face sence the camera scans the planet like a fax machine. They dont just come across it very often. They evan used a special camera that zooms in very close to the planet. They still saw that the planets face was nothing more than a landform.\n \n In conclusion the face is nothing.

Many people thought that this was created by aliens.\n \n Now first of all aliens haven't been proved real yet, so if aliens aren't real then how can people say aliens did it. In the first image taken in 1976 I can understand why people are creating theories. But if you look at the one taken in 2001 you can clearly see that it is a mesa. Even in 1998, when technology was advancing, you can still see that it is a mesa or just even a type of landform.\n \n Like Garvin says \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" and I agree with him completely. I bet if we looked now with the technology we have with could see little rocks on the ground because our country is so advanced in technology.

    Essay: "The image that Viking 1 took in 1976 was a startling one to say the least. A rather creepy face looks up at the surveyor. It is as if someone built a face in the side of the planet. And many people did see it that way.\n \n But as the descriprion says in the story \"...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" So NASA the space program, states that it is meerly shadows and hills. I would think that they would be a more trust worthy source than anyone else telling you that this was an alien's doing.\n \n Many people claimed that NASA was trying to hide this information but as the article states \"...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" This is because in part they are probalbly intrieged by the idea of an alien civilization, but also because it would bring in a lot of buisness. The funds that it would bring in would be enourmous. I just cannot think of a reason why NASA would wan't to hide that.\n \n Then again in 1997 NASA snapped another picture of it ten times as sharp as the last one. revealing rocks as can be seen in the picture. And still some were unhappy with the results and asked for more. In 2001, they got their results. NASA caught a picture with \"maximum resolution\" and it is evident in the picture that these are hills. They state in the article \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see waht they were!\" It states in the article that it is like butte or mesa-landforms which can be found in Western America. These shapes are made on earth natrually. So why can't they be made on another planet natrually?\n \n All the evidence points to a natrual land-scape on Mars.

    Essay: "From what I've read, I believe that the Face is a natural landform. There are three reasons that I think this, and I'll explain them all in this essay.\n \n My first reason for believing the Face is a natural landform is that if NASA knew anything about aliens or artifacts, then they would probably tell us. In paragraph 5, the author states, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" It's their job, and they would get paid more if they discovered something about aliens.\n \n My next reason is that even if the first photo taken of the Face looked like an alien artifact, the second photo proved that wrong by having a much higher quality.. According to the author in paragraph 11, \"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were,\" which proves that the Face isn't an alien structure or artifact.\n \n My last reason is that the Face is a mesa, just like the kind we have on Earth. In paragraph 12, the text states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,\" showing how the Face is just a normal landform with strange shadows.\n \n In conclusion, there are probably many other arguments that prove that the Face is just a natural landform, but the reasons above are the most convincing ones I found in this article.",

    Essay: "The Landform that Looks like a Face\n \n On Earth, there are many landforms that might look like a person or a thing. On Mars, there is a landform that looks like a face. This Face has had several photos of it taken by Viking 1 in 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) in 1998, and another (MGS) in 2001. The Face looks like a face because of its characteristics. Although it looks like an enourmous head, it is really just a mesa or butte, a landform, that happens to look like a face.\n \n One reason that this landform is not a face is because NASA revealed a close up picture of the face, revealing only a landform. That picture had a caption that stated, \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Before, there were pictures that weren't as high resolution, so it looked like a face but is now proven to be just a landform. This shows that the landform that looks like a face, is just a landform since there is a photo that shows what the \"face\" actually is. This means the face is just a mesa or butte.\n \n Another reason why this Face is just a natural landform, is because this landform is in Cydonia where mesas are common. The text states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharoah.\" This shows that mesas in Cydonia are common. Also, the mesa just had unusual shadows that gave it the appearence of a face. This means that this face was just a landform.\n \n Another reason, is that some landforms, like on Earth look like something other than a landform. The text states, \"'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.', says Garvin.\" This shows that some landforms can represent or look different from what it really is. This would be the Face oon Mars that is a landform. This wouldn't be a face.\n \n Though some people, like cospiracy theorists, may say that NASA wants to hide a type of evidence for life on Mars, they are wrong. The text states,\"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence for life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say cospiracy theorists.\" The text also states, \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" NASA responds to conspiracy theorist in this way, because if NASA were to be responsible for discovering life on Mars, they would benefit. This shows that though NASA would like to be responsible fo discovering life on Mars, NASA just wanted to prove that this Face is just a natural landform.\n \n Overall, there are several reasons why this Face is just a natural landform. One of them is that NASA took a picture of the Face, revealing just a landform. Another reason, is that mesas are common in Cydonia, the area where the Face was found. Another reason, is that thhis landfprm like others can look different from what it really is. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landform.",

There is too much evidence disproving the theory that the face is an alien structure or artifact for the idea to even be fathomable.\n \n The picture clearly shows that this formation could not possibly be that of alien descent. Scientists have proved on three different occasions that it is merely another isolated Martian mesa, which was common in the area Cydonia. NASA scientist Jim Garvin states, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa,\" which only proves further that there is no sign of unknown life present on Mars.\n \n Although NASA researchers would have benefited from having found alien life on Mars, they have proved that no such life exists or has existed on the planet Mars.

The article, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" tells how the truth is revealed. I can prove that the Face is just a landform and not some superstitious icon.\n \n First of all, back in 1976, the quality of pictures and images probably aren't going to be that outstanding. The pictures are blurry and they are the first documented pictures of that landform. I know this because paragraph seven states, \" And so on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" Later in paragraph seven, the text says,\n \n There was no alien monument after all.\" This is why the Viking's pictures aren't credible sources, and that people shouldn't trust the Face in that picture.\n \n Now, some might say, back then, that the alien markings are hidden by the haze. The text in paragraph eight says why,\"The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" However, later pictures still prove that the alien creation was not real.\n \n The MGS images prove that the Face is just another landform on Mars. This is because the MGS was able to get another photo. Paragraph 10 states, Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" At a moment like that, the time for taking a picture is perfect.\n \n To add on to that cloudless day, the photo taken is eaxtroardinary. In paragraph 10 Garvin says, \"\"Malin's team captured an extroardinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\"\" The paragraph also states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" The quality is exceptionally clearer than the picture taken in 1976. The cracks and clear image show that there aren't any aliens, but that the Face is nothing but a huge rock formation.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just a rock formation on Mars. Back in 1976, the quality of pictures weren't that great. Through time though, the quality of pictures did get better, and the MGS was able to take a picture of the Face on April 8th, 2001, showing that it was a rock, or, \"The Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West,\" as paragraph 12 says.

Well as you can tell Mars always had many landforms and The Face happens to be one. How can you prove that? people might ask. Well when Viking caught the images of the Face, ot certainally goes along with the fact that it does look like a FAce but agai the clearer the image got, the face slowly dissaper.

What does that mean?\n \n Now on my side of the story or opinion it clearly looks like a landform and the way it got it's \"face\" was by something reflecting off an object and making it seem like someone had of built that,\n \n But again. those images do not show anything about a face and how could have \"aliens\" buolt something so clearly and so presised. The clues just don't go together.\n \n In conclusion until realistic facts are proven i would stick wit the face that these are natrual landforms and \"aliens\" had nothing to with the fact that they built it.",

Now, have you ever heard of the \"Face on Mars?\" If you have, then this is going to explain to you why the Face is a natural landform and not some monument created by aliens.\n \n When NASA first saw the \"Face on Mars\" they claimed they spotted what the text states, \"the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" The image was found when they were snapping photos of possible landing sights for Viking 2, one of NASA's spacecrafts circling the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The passage later states, \"But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.\" The scientits even said it was just a landform. They stated that it has,\"unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" The scientists are not saying it's a alien monument either. They are just saying people could petray it that way.\n \n A few days after this discoery NASA unveiled the image. When they unveiled it there was a capiton under it reading, \"huge rock formation.\" NASA said the formation resembles a head and was formed by shadows giving the illusion of the facial features. This just made the Face a publicity stunt for most people. This might be when most would believe that it is some sort of a alien monument. But then NASA passed over the Face again and this time took a phots much greater then the last.\n \n On April 5, 1988, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the \"Face on Mars.\" They snapped picutres ten times sharper then before.

So, there is nothing to worry about. If you don't believe me, just keep reading... and you will soon learn it is just your imagination. But some people probably never will learn. Till then, just read this... Maybe I will change your mind if you really believe it is a face. Or maybe I won't. Let's see what you choose.\n \n First, it just your eyes messing with you! Your eyes can play tricks on you and make you see things that are not really there. This is just rocks oddly placed and the rocks have shadows. That it all your seeing. If it were really a so called \"face\" on Mars, that would mean there would have to be life on Mars before. Have they proven life on Mars? They only found traces of water in the past. So, there could have been life on mars, but we haven't found anything besides this Face. Yes, if we found more ''faces'' we could consider it. But, we haven't, and there isnt enough evidence to support it.\n \n Also, over the past 25 years... we've seen the Face everywhere in papers.\n \n This could all be a scam, people are just trying to get people intrested in Mars more. There is always false advertisment in commercials, news articles, ect. This is just another one of those! We would have found something out in 25 years. And what do you know? Nothing. All there is, is a picture. They even took a picture a second time and still found nothing,said it was just a natural landform. So, there is NOTHING to worry about.\n \n Say this is a alien artifact... Do you have anything else besides the Face that they've? Are aliens even REAL?? Nobody really knows because there is only skepitics. Let's be honest about this, it's NASA. There are very intelligent people there. I'm sure the best of the best. They wouldn't lie about some rocks would they? No... but people believe what they choose. People's eyes see what they want to see. Hear what they want to hear, no matter what the truth is. If you were to ask anyone about the face being an alien artifact or it just being a natural landform, not everyone would agree.\n \n All of the rocks could have moved over time and made the Face. Honestly, your eyes are just playing tricks with you. They are showing you something that isnt there. It is only shadows. Nothing else. Is it odd it is shaped to look like a face? Of course yes. This is all like ''Big Foot'' people are just making up stories. And seeing a tree but they think it is Big Foot's shadow. Your going to soon grow out of it and come to your senses.

Till then, just use your logic. Do you really think it is something more then rocks?\n \n I hope I've at least made you consider that the face is a landform. If I didn't... well maybe no one will. But I know what I believe is true. IT IS JUST A LANDFORM. And until you give ME evidence to your side of the story. You can't change my mind either. Fair enough, right?\n \n I rest my case.",

    Essay: "Since the time of its discovery, the \"Face on Mars\" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counter-arguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.\n \n Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the \"fiction\" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.\n \n The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counter-argument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counter-argument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the \"Face on Mars\" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face on Mars\" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution.",

Thay called it the \"Face on Mars\", and it became hugely popular, making appearances in movies, books, radio talk shows, and even grocery store checkout lines in the form of magazine covers. Contrary to some popular belief, wasn't anything to do with aliens, and here's why.\n \n The Face on Mars is what you would call the Martian equivalent of a mesa, a natural landform that is common in the American West. The scientists assumed so whenit first appeared on screen, but this particular mesa had shadows that made it look kind of like an Egyption Pharaoh. When releasing the images to the public, the author of the article made it sound like the eighth wonder of the world, trying to attract attention to Mars, and it worked.\n \n The photographs that were first taken of the \"Face\" were very hazy, and many people believed that there were some sort of alien markings under all the fog. The truth is, they took amazing photos with maximum resolution on April 8th, 2001, and there were no markings, aircrafts, little structures, or pyramids to be seen anywhere. What the picture does show is that the \"Face\" is, in fact, a kind of butte or mesa on Mars. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Eploration program, said it reminded him of \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\".

But still, many disagree that it is simply just a landform.\n \n Nasa sending out the Viking 1 and bringing back that picture has made a big impact on NASA. Alot of scientist did not beleive that it was a face. But \"the Face on Mars\" has become a pop icon. This \"Face on Mars\" starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout linesfor 25 years. But NASA scientist were still a bit doubtfull.\n \n In 1998 NASA felt that it was important to tax payers to see the for sure if the \"the Face on Mars\" was really a face at all. When Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural alndform. So all these people believed that it was a face but it actually turned out, from real pictures taken, to be a landform.\n \n But still not evryone was content with that. The \"Face on Mars\" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera that took the last picture of the \"Face on Mars\" had to peer through wispy clouds to see the \"Face\". So in April 8, 2001-a clodless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. And once again the even more advanced picture of the \"Face on Mars\" looked like a mesa or a butte.\n \n Now some people will say that NASA is trying to cover up something, that they are hiding something from the public. Others say that NASA doesn't want people to know if there are aliens out there. But what people lack in that accusation is the fact that if NASA would've discovered aliens, it would be one of the most popular and profitable organizations on Earth. NASA trying to verify, by spending millions of dollars on global surveyors to take pictures of Cydonia, if the \"Face on Mars\" is really a face is not them trying to hide anything. In fact its NASA trying to satisfy the public in best ways they can. And people even say that the pictures arent good enough to tell for sure. NASA's surveyor's camera pixel in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\n \n So in conclusion, even though you dont beleive that its a natural landform, and i understand why, facts and real photos beg to differ that idea of a face on the Mars. All the times NASA has sent out surveyors to bring pictures to the public, the public just gave them garbage. So honestly all i can say is that all the facts and pictures that NASA has provided us with to understand the face or landform is for a reason. And thats so people can see and decide for themselves wheather it a face or a landform. But really if a scientist and an entire corporation of intellegiant scientist with high degrees say its a landform, then that they're aren't going to lie to an entire planet of people.",

    Essay: "The Face on Mars was a natural creation. It is similar to the Middle Butte landform in Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. The facial features was created by shadows makily it look eerely like a face. The features of the Face are an optical illusion. NASA concluded that it was not made by aliens.\n \n The Face is similar to teh Middle Butte. The Middle Butte is a lava dome that takes the form of a face. The landforms are common around the western parts of the United States. The picture shows a face that could only be like the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho. This is how the Face could be a natural feature. The Middle Butte from Idaho was formed when lava and the earth combined and made it look like a face when you are on Google Earth. The Face on Mars is just like the Middle Butte that is in Idaho. It is possible that there was once lava or a liquid that combined with the surface to make a facial feature that you see when you look at the Face on Mars. The Face on Mars is also not very well detailed. If it was a monument then it would have detail. It would have eyebrows or details around the mouth and eyes so it resembled a certain person. This is how the Middle Butte on Mars is a natural figure.\n \n The Face was an optical issusion. There was shadows that made the Face look relatively similar to a human face. The shadows also could have been formed by the clouds that were blocking the view of Viking for a while. The Viking had to get closer to take a picture of the natural landform. The landform could have been just a pile of dirt or a pile of rocks that had holes that made it look simillar to a face. Some people argue that the alien markings were hidden by the hazey clouds. When the Viking went over the Face it only took a few pictures. When the Mars Global Surveyor went over Cydonia for the first time they snapped a picture 10 times better than the original Viking picture. The picture from Mars Global Surveyor had better quality than the picture from Viking. This is how the clouds and the camera on the Viking made an optical illusion.\n \n NASA concluded that the Face was not like the Egytian style pyramids. They came to a decision that the Face was just a landform that under the certain circumstances looked like a face. The people at NASA also said that the camera had zoomed in so that if there was a shack or an airplane or a person on the ground that they would be able to see it. NASA even used a different camera that has better zoom than the one used in 1976. The camera used in 1976 was 43 meters per pixel. The one used in 2001 was 1.56 meters per pixel. If they didn't find any proof of alien life with the 2001 image then how can you argue their is any aliens?\n \n In conclusion the Face on Mars is a natural figure. NASA verified that the Face was just an optical issusion. The camera on Viking was not very good compared to the camera of later explore Mars Global. The camera on Mars Global was able to take a picture 10 times better than the one on Viking. The face and eyes and mouth were created by shadows. This is how the Face on Mars is not an alien monument.",

    Essay: "There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is?\n \n The face is a very mysterious thing. It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also they might not belive in aliens.\n \n There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face. So they start to think what could have created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.\n \n People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.\n \n On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his \"Mars Orbiter Camera\" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. But on April 8, 2001 he set out for another picture. They took an extrodinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform. So therefore the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.\n \n In conclusion people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landorm because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.",

    Essay: "Why does everybody suspect that their is life on Mars when they see a wierd form of rock on it when really itÂ´s nothing like that? Well thats how a lot of people were thinking when NASA revealed the picture of the Face on Mars. However thats not true. NASA has proven in so many ways that itÂ´s just a natural landform, but of course some people think that itÂ´s not natural at all.\n \n First, NASA was very suprised to see something like that on the camera of Viking 1 spacecraft. But that went away really fast. Â¨Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows made it like an Egyptian Pharaoh.Â¨(2) This tells you that itÂ´s just a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all.Â¨(7) This tells you that they never found an alien artifact on April 5,1998. All they found was a natural landform on Mars.\n \n Finally, since not everyone was convinced that it was a natural landform, NASA decided to go back and get an even clearer picture of the Martian mesa. This time they used an even stronger camera to show the world that NASA is right.\"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,Â¨ he added. Â¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!Â¨(11) This can tell you that NASA was trying to tell everyone that their cameras are good enough to spot and see if itÂ´s just a natural landform, so now you shouldnÂ´t be complaning about the pictures.\n \n All of this evidence can tell you that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform, not a alien artifact.

    Essay: "When the first photograph of the \"Face on Mars\" appeared in 1976, researchers and the general public lost their minds. The 'face' was a blurry and shadowy photo from the Viking 1 mission. The photo resembled a human face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Dispite all of the scientific and theorietical chaos it created, researchers at the National Areonautics and Space Administration (NASA) discovered that the 'face' was just a matian mesa.\n \n Many people, even today, believe that this natural landform is actually an alien monument. This fallacy lead to many studies, researches, and experiments to find out what the face was. One explaination should cool the heated debated is that NASA is a professional institution built to study this very topic. It is also comprised of educated experts that work to learn and discover more for the rest of the population to learn correctly. However, this is not enough for many people to prove only the plausible.\n \n In \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the first portion of the article shows 3 compared photographs. These photographs are all of the 'face,' just in 3 different years. The first photo was taken in 1976, the next was in 1998, and the last one was taken in 2001. Each photo perfectly shows a new piece of the 'face' that was not well understood. The first photo shows what does clearly look like a face in the shadows, but as the photos become more recent, the face receads and becomes what looks like a river, or lava system flowig down the sides. These photographs were taken by separate space missions by none other than NASA. These photos are what fueled the conspiracy theorists theories but only because of the lack of information that they had at the time.\n \n In the article, in paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had taken the sharpest photo of the time. This photo stood to prove what the NASA researchers were trying to say. The photograph itself proved that there were not alien markings on the 'face' and that it was only a natural landmark. This photo showed that the elements that made up the 'face,' were just \"the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mesa.\" (12) It showed small elevated spots on the surface that, from afar and in the shadows, a human-like face appeared around all of it.\n \n However, for some headstrong citizens, this still was not enough to prove what the photo really showed. This lead to the 2001 MGS mission to capture yet another, improved photo of the surface of Mars. The team that which took the photo prided themselves on taking the \"extraordinary photo with the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" (10) In paragraph 10 of the article, it explains that in 2001, the resolution of the photo (1.56 meters per pixel) was beyond fantastic compared to the resolution of the 1976 photo (43 meters per pixel). This comparison is enough to show that in 2001, the landmark could be seen very clearly with the human eye and could be clearly made out as just a landform. The photo was clearly just a bit o' rock jutting out of the surface of Mars.\n \n The 1976 controversy over the \"Face on Mars\" was truely a very heated debate. Starting in 1976 when a blurry image of a face on Mars made it's way through the minds of the Americans, the \"Face on Mars\" was concieved to be an alien relic of some sort. Years later, a new photograph produced by NASA in 1998 began to settle long held debates over the face. It proved to many researchers that this startling human like face was only a natural landmark with a coincedental shape and shadow. This did not, however, settle all of the disputes amongst the ammeture conspiracy theorists. To further prove the point, NASA pushed it's limits in 2001 and took an amazingly sharp photo of the land mark. The photo was pure proof to the nation that the fantisized face was only a small mesa on the surface of Mars. Even today some theorists still try to hold their ground in their thoughts, but it will always be known to science as just a martian mesa that caused some commotion.",

And other propositions from ordinary people for this face on Mars have surely been made over the last twenty-five years.\n \n These things point to the fact that the face is merely a coincidence in a messa formation.",

    Essay: "The Face\n \n The Face that was found on Mars couldn't have been created by aliens. If so where is the proof of these aliens. Ask yourself if you really believe the Face was created by aliens? Dont you believe their would be some sort of evidence after all of the exploring of Mars. In this essay I'm going to write a argumentive explaining why aliens could'nt have made the Face and why I belive it is just a natural landform.\n \n I believe that this Face that was found on Mars could be a natural landform becuase of paragraph twelve. This paragraph says that the Face has resemblance to a butte or mesa, which are common landforms on Earth in the American West. It also states that it has resembalance to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These details are not exactly evidence that the Face is a natural landform, but it gives probable cause to think that it possibly is a natural landform.\n \n For those who feel that the Face was created by aliens, dont you belive their would be some type of evidence of a life form on Earth. As paragraph eleven stated if their were other structures like pyramids, airplanes, or small shacks we would be able to see what they were because we could dicern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If their were aliens I'm sure NASA wouldn't keep it a secret because they would possibly get more donations or money from people wanting NASA to go up and get even more pictures. Or even for NASA to take people up there themselves like a trip.\n \n Those who belive a alien created the face possibly would say that NASA would keep aliens a secret because it would frighten some people. They also could ask the question how and why did the rock or land for the way it did if its just a land form? For the first statement I can say that could be true, but the question I can't answer. I sure that someone who has studied it could though.\n \n The alien belivers can also say that the aliens hide when humans come to Mars but that is something that can't be proven or disproven.\n \n In conclusion, aliens couldn't have made the Face because their should be some type of proof that their has been life on Mars. Especially since we have photos of Mar's surface and have a rover on its surface. I feel that the Face is just a natural landform because it resembles a butte or mesa and because their is no sort of proof that their are aliens or any type of life form on Mars. Alien belivers could ask the question, how was the Face formed like a face, but I can't answer this question.",

    Essay: "The face, is it martian made or a natural landform? The face is not a alien artifact it is a land form that is formed with facial features like eyes and a nose. The Viking 1 captured a mesa land formation that resembled a face not a martian made artifact. In 1998 a MOC team captured a picture that proved the \"Face\" was a mesa land form. Then agian in 2001 another team captured a picture of the mesa with a Mars Global Surveyor agian NASA came to the conclusion it was a mesa.\n \n In 1976 a Viking 1 camera captured a bone chilling picture of what looks like a face. As scientists studyed the picture they came to the conclusion that it was an oddly formed mesa that resembled a human face. After they let the picture out to the public the popularity of this mesa sky rocketed it haunted the world for twenty five years before NASA did another expadition to prove it was a mesa.\n \n In 1998 a GOC team captured a picture of this so called face. After further exsamination NASA found the face to be a land form commonly known as a mesa. After studying the mesa the group of scientists compaired the face to mesas in Cydonia, the area the face was found, they came to the conclusion the face was really a mesa that had a peculiar formation.\n \n Then agian in 2001 skeptics lead NASA to do another expadition to capture another picture of the phonomanon. After finding the same evidince as they had the past two times NASA ruled it a mesa. Skeptics had no way of saying the face was anything but a mesa. NASA had proven it three times there was no denying it, the face was a land formation that was rather common were the pictures were taken.\n \n Now NASA could be wrong the pictures could have been edited to contain the secret that there was life on mars. NASA could have tampered with the photographs to mislead the public. But life on mars would be good for NASA, the fact that we are not alone would get NASA the funding to start all kinds of expaditions that would help the United States in the Space race to mars. If there was life on mars NASA would have trillions of dollars to fund there research on the planet. This proves that NASA's findings were correct that the face is a mesa that looks oddly like a human face.\n \n After reading this you should realise the face is nothing more than a mesa land formation that was blown out of preportion. The media took a simple fact and turned it into a alien artifact this concludes the fact that the face was a naturally formed mesa nothing less nothing more. The face is a mesa that looks strangly like a human face that became a pop icon for twenty five years.",

    Essay: "If the face was created by aliens then their would be a civilization on the planet long before. Even if that could be really thrilling that ,however, is not true. The Face that is on Mars is a mesa because reaserch and pictures where analized, it matches to our natural landforms, and their are multipule in Cydonia. Each of these prove that it is not made by aliens, as cool as that would be. If we go more into depth we will talk about the pictures and research, our landforms, and the multipule in Cydonia.\n \n First off, The face on Mars is a mesa ,thanks to the pictures that where analized. It could also pose as a butte like the one in Snake River Plain of Idaho. The text states that, \"What each picture actually shows is the martian equivalent to a mesa or buttle.\" (12) It just shows how much just one picture can prove.\n \n Second, This looks like just another one of our landforms. Like I had said before it is like the Middle butte in Snake River Plain. In the text it states that , \"Thousands of web surfers waiting when the image was revealed on the JPL wedsite, appearing... a natural landform.\" (7) If thousands of people had saw a landform appear how do you not see that it is like the ones on Earth.\n \n Finally, in Cydonia their are already multiple mesas. The only difference is that this one is more face like. The articale says, \" It was just another Martian mesa, common aruond Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows around it.\"(2) If NASA had done research to see about other laandforms and they have proven that their are more than one on the plane, then it must be true.\n \n Most people say, \"The face is bona fide evidence on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" (5) However why would NASA want to ruin their entire budget by saying that their was a civilization on Mars to begin with. So these three points, landforms, pictures, and the multiple mesas, should show that The Face really is not a martian creation.",

I believe that the Face is a natural land form because if NASA had proof that aliens created the Face or any alien life is found NASA would tell us.\n \n First, I strongly think that NASA would tell us if there were aliens who created the Face because in paragraph 5, the author says, \"Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" NASA actually says their hoping there is an alien civilization on Mars and they shared pictures of the Face to the world so that shows they would be excited to tell us if our thoughts of extra terestrial life were real. Also, in paragraph\n \n NASA puts under the description of the picture that it is just a huge rock fomation and the shadow in the picture just gives the illusion of a face.\n \n NASA always keeps us posted on pictures and information, they tell the world through pictures and research what's going on in outside of Earth like the pictures from the Viking 1 in 1976, the Mars Global surveyor picture from 1998, and the 2001 picture from the latest MGS. If NASA did not want the world to know about these things they wouldnt tell us at all what's going on but they do because they want us to be interested.\n \n In conclusion, I am clearly convinced that the Face is a natural landform because NASA woud inform us if there were alien affairs taking place on Mars.",

    Essay: "While NASA's greatest scientists were working hard in their Jet Propulsion Lab in 1976, an eerie picture appeared on their monitors, as the spacecraft they sent to Mars, the Viking 1, has taken a picture of what looks like an alien-built human face on Mars, though it was actually another basic landform on the red planet. The reason Viking I was taking pictures of Mars was to scope out possible landing sites for its sister ship, the Viking 2. The scientists did realize that this \"face\" was just another common Martian landform, so when they put the picture up, its caption stated that it was only a rock formation resembling a human head. In order to fully prove to everyone that the Face on Mars was just a landform, they even sent the MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, to retake pictures of the area presumed to be the face. They even sent it back for another round of retakes thanks to peoples' suspicions of cloudy weather blocking the view of the face! Thanks to many tests and retakes, scientists have proven that the Face on Mars is just another landform.\n \n While Viking 1 was taking pictures on Mars to find a landing site for Viking 2, it snapped a picture of what appeared to be a gigantic face staring at them like a man staring at the stars with binoculars. Although scientists were very surprised when the face appeared on the monitors in their lab, their sensation lasted only a short time. They figured it was only another common Martian mesa with shadows that only resembled a human face. So that they could get enough hey-everyone-check-this-out popularity for the red planet, they made the image of the Face on Mars public, and the NASA scientists gave it the caption noting that it was \"a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Thanks to this new caption, public attention for Mars, but it ended up dominating people's view on Mars, making them create conspiracy theories rather than convince the truth that it was only another landform on Mars. Despite the people making the Face on Mars a well-known pop icon, it always was and always will be another Martian landform.\n \n In order to prove to the people that the Face on Mars was an ordinary-as-white-paint landform, they sent a new probe, the Martian Global Surveyor, or MGS, to Mars in 1998 to try to retake pictures of the face. The MGS succeeded at its task, as it swayed public opinion away from the idea that the face had to do with alien life existing on Mars at that time. Thousands of looking-forward-to-this web explorers were waiting for the picture to become public, they were also disappointed by the fact that it was a natural landform rather than an exotic alien monument. However, not everyone was satisfied with these results, as they wanted more proof that the face was a face and not a landform thanks to cloudy weather. The MGS did succeed in proving that the Face on Mars was not a face, though more attempts were required to get the idea to everyone.\n \n Not everyone was content with the results of the MGS expedition, wanting to believe that the cloudy weather at the time the picture was taken to be responsible for the lack of the face's visibility. Despite how NASA's chief scientist for their Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, stated that \"it's not easy to target Cydonia,\" the people wanted more retakes. NASA was able to get the MGS to get better shots of the face in April 2001, and they were able to capture a wonderful photo with the camera's maximum resolution, which dominated the Viking 1's resolution by being nearly thiry times better. Thanks to Garvin's reasoning and the high-as-the-sky resolution of the MSG's new pictures, they were able to prove that the face was only the equivalent of a butte or mesa, both of which were common landforms. Thanks to the MSG's multiple trips, they captured enough well-detalied pictures to prove the true identity of the Face of Mars.\n \n The Face of Mars is only an ordinary landform, and it always will be just another ordinary landform. The scientists began with a caption to the original photo stating that it was a landform only resembling a face, then they sent the Mars Global Surveyor out to try to prove that the Face on Mars was a landform. They also later sent the MGS out again during not-cloudy-at-all weather to let everyone know for sure that the face was not a face. All of these efforts combined let people know how the Face on Mars was not a face but only a landform, but there are likely still people out there who belive that the Face on Mars is still some type of alien relic. Despite how popular the conspiracy theories about the Face of Mars being an alien monument, it was only a standard landform the whole time.",

    Essay: "A Face To Remember\n \n A distinctly human face, nearly two miles in length, stretches across an arid, barren landscape. This came to be known as \"the face on Mars. It is a highly debated topic, being that some believe it was made by intelligent lifeforms, and others believe it to be a naturally formed landform. The latter is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, correct, the reasons range from picture evidence, to the same landforms forming on Earth, to the fact that it would help NASA's budget immensely if life were to be discovered on other planets.\n \n To begin with, concrete photos have been released to the public that clearly show that the \"face\" is merely shadows cast onto a natural landform. Since the beginning of its discovery in 1976, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah.\" Guess what? They were right, because in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor brought back a photo of the mesa that was in the \"...absolute maximum resolution,\" and it perfectly showed the mesa for what it was; a naturally formed chunk of land.\n \n Another thing distinct about this landform is that we have similair, proven-to-be natural landforms on Earth. To quote Garvin, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" This means it is an undeniable truth that these kind of things can form naturally. Of course because something can, usually means that it will, so, without denial, this landform is proven to be real, and able to form.\n \n The final fact of the matter is that NASA would get an enormous amount of funding if they could prove there to be life among the stars. So the truth is, \"...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" This discovery would lead to a piqued interest in space, and a need to conduct further research, meaning people would begin to give more donations to this new, interesting cause. In the end NASA would benefit, and the point is proven wrong.\n \n Over all, consiracy theorist seemingly wish to stir the masses, and make distrust flourish, but most times their theories are easily dissproven. The theory of the face on Mars was simple, and very wrong. The topic of solid photographs seems not to be enough, but the similair landmarks being on Earth, and the way it would positively effect NASA's budget should be. After all, there may still be life on Mars, for this is but a bump on a planet.",

Why is this \"landfrom\" one of a kind? Mars has been a planet for years and only has one Face. Which proves that, aliens could have created this. Maybe it is a self portrait, or a sign. The picture of the face was first taken on April 5, 1998. This gives the aliens plenty of times to create the face. On Mar the landforms are remotly the same because of the climate effects everything in a similar way.\n \n NASA believes aliens are real. If NASA has found evidence that aliens may be real, then why don't they think aliens created this? Aliens could be capable of doing this. The Face could be an alien artifact.

    Essay: "Have you ever seen an illusion where it looked like a figure, but then you realize it was just something else?\n \n Everyone has had that happen, and that is because your brain is being fooled. Recently, research shows that your brain assumes something when it looks like what you think of. For example, the pop icon, known as the \"Face of Mars,\" has fooled many scientists as NASA, making them believe that aliens were trying to give out signals. Unlike the other scientists, I believe that this \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural landform that looks similar to a human face.\n \n First of all, I believe that this peculiar face was made from the winds on Mars. It is true that when erosion occurs on Earth, tiny sediments of rocks are moved away from the original rock. I believe that erosion also occurs on Mars because a rock that looks like a face does not show up all of the sudden. Also, as you can see in the picture Viking 1 photographed, you can see tiny holes on the forehead of this rock. It is my opinion that this rock was eroded at some time and started to form a figure of a face.\n \n Secondly, the picture resolution of the rock was not as clear as it is today. So because of the resolution, the image looked similar to a human face.\n \n Also, at the time of 1976, scientists still believed in the theory of aliens. However, about 22 years later, the workers at NASA captured the image of the rock again, but this time they used higher resolution. Then scientists were putting it all together by finding out that this rock was not a signal coming from Martians. So because of the resolution of the picture, the sceintists assumed that the rock came from aliens.\n \n However, just because this face-like rock is from aliens doesn't mean that the theory of aliens isn't true.\n \n There are still many beliefs that aliens exist. For example, in 1957, there was a group of aliens coming toward a farmer. However, they left Earth and there were no other signs of aliens from then. Then there was the flying saucer in the sky in 2013.\n \n Many people assumed that it was a UFO, and there are still some research about that incident today. So even though that there was no sign of life on Mars, there has to be life somewhere out in the universe.\n \n In conclusion, people still believe that the \"Face on Mars\" still came from aliens. Some people are like me, who believe that the rock was formed from erosion and that scientists didn't have the resolution at the time to figure out that it wasn't really a human face. Overall, the rock was just a mesa on Mars.",

    Essay: "The face-like structure found on mars is just a natural landform. It looks like landfroms we would find on Earth and the photograph we took in 2001 says the same thing. Consider the following reasons why this landform was not created by aliens.\n \n First of all, the landform looks like a mesa or butte from the American West. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAÂ’s Mars Exploration Program, says \"Â“It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,Â” says Garvin. Â“ThatÂ’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.Â”\" The author of this article says, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" The Face is not made by aliens. It is just a landform the happend to look like a face.\n \n Second reason is this. The landform that looks like a face is the same as the other matian equivalent to buttes of mesas. There are other mesas on Mars it just happens that this one looks like a face. If you look at a 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars, you see there is another mesa or butte below the Face. This mesa or butte has no special form or image. It is just another mesa or butte. The Face is not made by aliens. It is just a natural landform the happend to look like a face.\n \n The last reason why the Face was not made by aliens is because in 2001 NASA took a new, clear picture that shows the landform is not a face. In 1976 the Viking 1 took a photo that looked like a face. This is where the idea of aliens making the Face came into play. In 1998 a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) took a picture that did not quite look like a face but did not quite look like a nature land form either. It convinced some it was natural and some still believed that it was made by aliens. The author says, \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001Â—a cloudless summer day in CydoniaÂ—Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" The picture of the Face from the MGS in 2001 convinced most people that this was really a natural landform and the Face was just a coincedence.\n \n The Face found on Mars is not made by aliens. It is a natural landform called a mesa or a butte. The picture of 1976 is misleading and out of date. The newest picture taken in 2001 shows the real, updated version. The landform is a mesa not an alien made creation.",

    Essay: "Do you think aliens exist? The face on Mars was not created by aliens, but by the natural forming of the planet. These examples will show how the face on Mars came to be.\n \n The face on Mars was just a natural occurence and not a cover up from aliens. The first example is there are other little landforms right by the face. This exampl means that the face was just another landform and that maybe things formed just right to look semi-close to a human face. The second example is that as cameras got better it started looking less and less like a face. This example states that as cameras got better resolutions they actually found out it was just a mesa. The final example is when they were looking at the face there were misty clouds in the way. This example shows that the clouds could have interfered with the picture causing shadows to hover over the face at just the right angle to give the face a more human look. Finally, these examples show how the face was just a natural occuring landform and not a human-like face.\n \n If aliens in fact did make the face then why does it look more like a natural occuring landform then a face. First example is the aliens couldn't have built a mass structure that is about 2 miles long and wide without building anything else. This example shows that the aliens would have had to leave other structures alike there too. The next example is if the aliens did make the structure they would have had to leave footprints or building materials behind. This example shows that the aliens would have had to leave something behind just like we do at construction sites today. The last example is how could have the aliens built such a large structure in such harsh conditons. This example tells that the aliens couldn't have built in under very cold conditons at night and under barely any atomsphere to breath in. Lastly, these examples show that aliens couldn't have built a structure like that on mars even if it was a face.\n \n The structure was just a landform on mars all this time. The first example is if it was a face it would've been hidden by NASA. This means that if it was indeed a face NASA would have hidden it from the public and studied it greatly. The next example is that again, if it was a face NASA would've greatly beneifited from the discovery. This example shows that NASA wouldn't have shown the public if there had been signs of extra terristrial activity. Finally the last example is that aliens did not make this structure because it would've been an actual alien momument. This example tells that if there was evidence of life NASA claimed that they would know. Thus, these examples show of no alien life on mars.\n \n The conspiracy theorsists might think that NASA is hiding something, but they are wrong because it would have beneifited NASA from hiding it. So all this time people have thought it was a face on Mars, they were wrong because pictures have shown of no humane signs on the landform thanks to better technology. So do you still think aliens exist?",

    Essay: "The Face on Mars is a mystery of how it was created. Know one knows how it was made, if it was created by aliens or just a natural landform. People may think that since it is in space it has to do with aliens in some possible way. Scientist Jim Garvin discovered a landform similar to the Face on Mars. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the shape of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. They also have discovered that the surveyor has labeled it a natural landform. The Face on Mars is catergorized as a mesa which is around the American West. Could the Face on Mars be a natural landform?\n \n The similar land form in Idaho has the same height as the Face on Mars. The pictures that they have captured shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. If this was a alien type of act the MGS would have seen the alien's shelters, airplanes, and pyramids. The Face on Mars is not a alien' s sculpture. NASA's surveyor had labeled the face as a natural landform. The surveyor catergorized it as a natural landform because it didn't pick up any traces of alien activity. Also, if NASA wasn't forsure about their discovery they woudn't have posted it on websites or annonced it to the world. They said that they would have rathered kept this information classified. Why would you put a false statement on the internet, expecially if it involved aliens, because then the world would be going crazy. They would be preparing for them to attack and abduct people.\n \n I could understand why some people could believe that aliens made up this rock like object. One of the most obvious reasons is that it is space. On the day when they wanted to take another picture it was very cloudy and you couldn't see the face, which some believe that aliens had hid the face by a haze. But, we haven't had any discoveries or theroies of there being aliens in this galaxy.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform that was not created by aliens.",

Is it ture?\n \n NASA had released the picture to the public. They had made hollywood movies and book and had went on talk show talkiong about the face saying are there really aliens out there . For over good 25 years alot of people thought there really life on red planet. So NASA really wish there was life on Mars so they invented better camreas and ships to send back to Mars see if there was really life on Mars.\n \n In 1998 they had the on borad MGS taken a few pictures and had look like there was pymarids on mars. Cause of the shadows that the landform was making. 41 degrees north and that winter in april for Mars so there alot of clouds. But nasa had prepared took look one last time they said was super hard and alot of work. Because it like fax machine in narrow 2.5km wide strips. they said it just does not pass over face very often.\n \n \"Neverthless on april 8, 2001 it was a cloudy summer day on cydonia Mars Global Surveryor drew just enough for second look they\" said. In paragrapgh ten they had rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center of the face. With camera the maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters pixel from the 1976 vikings photo.\n \n It is a bust the Egyptian-style-pymarids or small shacks. It was a Butte or Mesa landforms. It was shadows or caverns in the landforms. It would of been cool if there ws alien life on there so we copuld learn more about the galaxy.

    Essay: "In the article Unmasking the Face on Mars the face is just a natural landform. The reason this is is because there has been things found like this before. Another is that there is no solid proof that the landform was made by aliens. A third reason is that the people that got the rumor started about all of this are conspiracy theorists.\n \n There has been things like this found in space before. In the article the author states that the sensation of finding the landform was short lived because scientists figured it was just another mesa. Since the scientist said another that means there has been things like this found before. If there has been others found before why is this one so special. The scientist state that they were not actually consstructed there.\n \n Besides that there is actually no solid proof that this landform was made by aliens. That is just an opinion. The fact that it looks lika face is the only reason people believed that the landform was made by aliens. Nobody has ever actually been on mars to investigate this landform and prove that it was made by aliens. The only things we have of it are just pictures. So that means that there is no solid proof that the landform was alien made.\n \n The people that came up with the rumor are conspiracy theorists. That means that the thought of this landform being alien made is just a conspiracy theory. A conspiracy theory is just a buch of bits and pieces of infromation that the theorist put together and think is suppost to mean something. These bits and pieces of infromation are put together even if they didn't happen in chronological order. That means that all a conspiracy theory is is an edjucated guess. Once again that also means there if no solid proof about it.\n \n All three of those reasons go along with the fact that the face looking landform in space is not alien made. All of the rumor about this landform beging alien made are just guesses and theories. With that being said I hope that now people will stop believing everything that people say about this subject unless they have solid proof that what they are saying is true.",

    Essay: "What would I say if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, when I don't? I would first off say they're are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. The only evidence we have are pictures that people send in of \"UFOs\" or \"aliens\" being spotted. Seriously those pictures could be easily edited with the power of the internet.\n \n The Face is just a natural landform! The Face, like many other landforms, looks (hince the name) like a face! Have you ever past by a hill, rock, or any other landform that kind of looks like a human or any other human part? If you have than you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you start thinking \"why does it look ike that?\" or \"what if someone's body is buried there?\".\n \n Although the Face looks like a face, it may have not been built by aliens. Like NASA said when they unveiled the image for everyone to see, it's just a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\". The Face was just formed by shadows and your eyes playing a little trick on you.\n \n We don't have enough evidence to prove that aliens created this, so it's much better if we stick to my idea. It's all the work of your eyes, shadows, and the form of the rock. If only we could go to Mars and figure out the truth.",

    Essay: "In 1976 Viking 1 snapped a photo of Mars. Viking 1 spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. Many people think it was created by the life on Mars. Many people think that it is just a natural landform. There was no alien creation after all. I am going to tell you why this is just a natural landform created on Mars.\n \n First, Michael Malin and his MOC took a picture of the \"face\" and claimed it to be just a natural landform. The picture was more clear than the orginal 1976 photograph. When NASA got a good shot at the \"face\" they rused out there to the Red planet to get a good shot. Jim Garvin said, \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a god shot at it.\" And it was revealed that it is a natural landmark.\n \n On April 8th, 2001 Cydonia became cloudless. And it was easy for NASA to see the mysterious face. NASA took a picture \"3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" So if there was an object like a airplane on the surface of Mars, you would be able to see what the object was. Turns out that the picture showed a butte or mesa.\n \n \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,\" says Garvin. The mysterious face turned out to be a butte. Not a Alien artifact. Each pixel in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters. compared to 43 meters per pixel in the Viking 1 photo. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,\" said Garvin.\n \n NASA is apart of the Government. The Government lies all the time. So that kinda makes people think that NASA is lying about the \"Face\" being a natural landmark. The Government and NASA are keeping secrets in Area 51. So they must be keeping this whole \"Face\" thing secret too. That it's not a butte or a mesa. But that it was created by life on Mars.\n \n In conclusion, NASA still hasn't prooved that there is life in Space. But does this \"Face\" landmark proove that there is? We just have to wait and find out. This is a story that has been going around for decades. And it is still unsolved. NASA recently found ice caps on other planets. And claimed that there was water on Mars but it evaporated, casusing the huge valleys and canyons on Mars.",

    Essay: "Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called \"Face\" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows. The \"Face\" is just an ordinary landform on Mars with unusual shadowing because of recent pictures taken of the natural landform, scientific evidence, and measurements taken.\n \n To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. \"On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degreesto center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel inv the best 1976 Viking photo.\" (p. 10). This shows that NASA has gotten a clear photo of the Face with much better photo quality then the first time iit was photographed.\n \n As discussed before, NASA has taken a new and better quality photo of the Face in Cydonia. Using our scientific equiopment at NASA, we have proven just how much better the resolution is on the new phototgraph taken is. \"\"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,\" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gtround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\" (p. 11). This quote from the article shows it has been scientifically proven there is no markings, indentations, or objects around the Face that would make it be a human skull.\n \n Finally, NASA compares the Face landform with similar landforms on Earth in America. The scientist compares the Face with a landform called a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West. \"it reminds me of Middle Buttle in the Snake ZRiver Plain of Idaho,\" says Garvin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" (p. 12). This uses a real-life example and measurements to compare the two landforms. The scientist Garvin poinmts out that both landforms--the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and the Face on Mars-- are around the height and shape,\n \n On the contrary, some people believe that the face is \"\"Bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists\" (p. 5). In defense, NASA has scientifically proven the \"Face\" is just a natural landform created on Mars. \"What the picture really shows is the Martien equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" (p.12).\n \n In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.",

I'm going to explain why I believe that my claim is correct.\n \n First, it is clearly obvious that the face only appers as a face because of low resolution cameras and odd shadows, as you can see from the most recent photographs of the rock face. Even in the 1998 picture it is pretty clear that it is not in fact a face but is just a rock formation. The clouds obscure some of the face in the 1998 picture so it might not be conclusive, but the 2001 picture proves it.\n \n Also, if there were alien life of Mars, that would skyrocket NASA's budget to get to Mars because the public would be going crazy and the whole world would want to know. If there were alien life on Mars and NASA was the administration to discover it, the whole world's eyes and wallets would be on them, expecting them to put some men on mars to try to make contact with the Martian life forms, thus winning the race to put astronauts on Mars.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is just a rock formation and nothing more than that.

NASAÂ’s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" This is an excerpt from the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\". This is describing a strange feature found on the face of mars in the region of Cydonia.\n \n At first there were no clear pictures of the face and no certain explanations. The Viking 1 found it in 1976 and back then the quality was not so great. Scientists thought \"it was just another Martian mesa\" but they also noted one unusual shadow, so they were not that clear on the reason. In 1998 NASA took another picture in better resolution but it was cloudy and some people were not convinced that it was a mesa. In 2001 NASA was finally able to capture a clear picture of the formation, putting down any kind of conspiracy theories.\n \n Speaking of conspiracy theories, many believed that \"...the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars\". Some theories were that aliens built \"an Egyptian pharoah\". Some of the scientists at NASA even believed that it was evidence of alien life on mars! Conspiracy theorists say that NASA would rather hide life on Mars, but defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilisation on mars becuase then NASA would get more money to go to mars.\n \n Now with higher resolution pictures NASA scientists have found what the \"Face\" really is. It seems that their earlier guesses were in fact correct! As quoted in \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\". The scientists were correct on saying it looked like a mesa. They have even found out with higher resolution pictures that it almost resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. They both have a similar height and shape.\n \n Sadly the \"Face\" is not an ancient alien ruins or a temple. Dont we all want it to be proof of life on mars? Scientists have proved that it is not though. Scientists say that it is in fact a mesa, and they put to rest a long standing mystery of the face on mars and any conspiracy theories with it.",

NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.

It sure does look like a face, but that was merely a coinsidence.\n \n There are many ways to prove this statement. Today, I will only cover a few, though. They are very good points. By the end of this, I think you'll be agreeing with me also.\n \n First of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body. If this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. Absolutely no body found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.\n \n The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now. This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.\n \n The third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest). \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin says.\n \n In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me.",

Also the messa was revealed to the public to draw attention to Mars not to assure alien life. These reasons are just two of the many that prove why \"The Face on Mars\" is a natural landform and not made by aliens.",

    Essay: "The Face: Alien Artifact or Natural Landmark\n \n Do you think that the \" Face on Mars\" is an alien artifact or is just a natural landform on Mars? Well, in my own personal opinion I believe that it is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, and took 10 pictures to get the perfet shot. I also believe this because, landforms are common around the American West. Although, some my think the picture is an alien artifact, it is not because NASA went back to Mars with an even better camera and, took even more pictures of the Face.\n \n First of all, I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, from their 1976 expidition, to see if the conspericy theories were correct, and they weren't. In the passage it says,\" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origninal Viking photos.\" It also says,\"\n \n the image first appeared on a JPL wed site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" I used these sentences because, they prove that NASA is corret, there wasn't any alien activity.\n \n I believe that the Face of Mars is an natural landform because, landforms are common around the American West. The passage says,\" What picture actually shows is the Martian equivialent ofa butte or mesa- landforms are acually common around the American West.\" I used thi sentence because, it shows that the landform wasn't a once-in-a-life-time sort of thing, you see them quite offten actutally. That is also something that people who don't believe NASA never take under consideration.\n \n Some people may believe that the Face is an alien artifact, but in all truthfulness it is a natural landform. I say this because, in 2001 NASA got some amazing cameras to take the best pictures that they could possibly take to prove themselves right. In the passage it says,\" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" I used this because, it proves that NASA has worked really hard to get high quality photos of the Face.\n \n In conclusion, I believe the Face is nothing more that a natrual landmark on Mars because, NASA went to Mars to get more pictures, after their mission in 1976, in 1998. I also belive this because, landforms are common in the American West area. Although, some may believe that the Face is an alien artifact it is not because NASA got high qualiy photos to prove it 2001. What do you think the Face is?",

    Essay: "Many people believe the face on Mars is an extraterrestrial being. Although it may seem true, the face is a natural landform. There are many facts to show this is a natural landform.\n \n Many scientists have seen this face as life on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists have said there is life on Mars,and NASA is trying to hide it from the people. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the face, but they revealed there was no face to be seen. There was only a natural landform. Scientists have began to lose hope of ever seeing the face again. If they were ever able to find the face again, they would have money to do more investigation. Although there were no extratrrestrial beings, people still believed the face would soon appear again. Scientists are still trying to look for ways to explain it all.\n \n Reasearchers are still looking for the face on Mars. Scientist Jim Garvin states, \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes an the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were !\" He is comparing airplanes, pyramids,and small shacks to the face which is no longer there. This statement proves that the face is a natural landform. Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing. Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive.\n \n Although the face is not real and is a natural landform, researchers will stop at nothing to prove it is real.

    Essay: "After releasing the photographs about a mesa on Mars or now known as the \"Face of Mars\", theories have come up claiming that it is in fact a face of an old extraterrestial. This is completely false claim that has no evidence or support to be supported with. This mesa is a common natural landform that can be found commonly around. This is a mesa that happens to look like a face. Although it can look pretty convincing and decieving, it's something common. Like mountains on Earth, it's something that triggers your brain claiming it to be something it isn't. It's like seeing a shadow pass by the corner of your eye! You claim you saw it, but it was just a fragment of your imagination. It's something our brains trigger.\n \n As it states in the article, praragraph two and three, it states that the face the public saw was just an illusion forming eyes, a mouth, and a nose. \"There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah.\" This sentence supports the claim that the face was a simple fargemnt of the brain creating an illusion of something. It's a common landform that naturally is created. Although many theorist's claim that it had to do something with aliens and extraterrestrials, there is no evidence to support or back up that claim. Where else have you seen something out of the normal on Mars? Where there any prints or traces leading to something else? People just need to understand that it's was a landform and a landform only. In paragraph three, it supports the claim that the face was a natural landform. \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation. . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" Not only did the face gain notorious fame, but the story got a lot of publicity and gained a lot more attention than it should have. All the face was was an illusion that the brain of many created. Although many knew it was a natural landform, many supporting those scientists wanted the outcome of the story to take a COMPLETELY different turn! Many wanted the face to be the result of an ancient civilization on Mars, which also couldn't be possible. There were a lot of crazy theories and rumors, but the truth was the one that people denied to believe in.\n \n This story took many turns, twists, accusations, false claims, and more incredible stuff made up by the public. Although it was a simple landform, many denied that to the core, and many defended that statement with their live's. The simple truth of this whole mess, is that it was a photograph taken of a natural landform near Cydonia, that was mistaken as a face with eyes, nose, and mouth by the illusions of many theorists or confused and intruiged viewers.

    Essay: "Is the Face on Mars a mesa or is it made by alien life? Well, the answer to that world-wide question is that it is a mesa. In other words, a natural landform that has been there or been made over time by the planets rotation. I strongly believe that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform, because we have almost like it on Earth, there are no signs of alien life in the pictures or scientific research, and the pictures taken, show that there are shadows that create a facial look in the natural landform.\n \n First off, we have a natural landform located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The one on Mars is almost equivalent to the one here on our planet. In paragraph 12, it states, \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" This is plainly saying that the one on planet Mars could just be a lava dome of some sort just like the one here on Earth.\n \n Also, there are no signs of alien life through the pictures taken from the cameras. How could this alien life we talk about create this Face, when there is no evidence of this alien life? The pictures were taken mutiple times in different years to make sure of this. They had people questioning, so they did further research. For example in paragraph number eight, \"...peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by daze.\" The skeptics that wanted the benifits of actually finding alien life wanted actual proof that it is merily only a mesa. They ende up being proved that it is only a mesa.\n \n To also say, the photographs that were studied have been intereprted. They have been interepreted to the point that they can pin-point certain material. They proved that by when they said that is merily shadows that the mesa has, from depth, that create the face like look. For example in paragraph number three, it states \"The captain noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'\" The images were showing that there were some dips in this mesa that created it to look as if it were an actual face.\n \n There are people who say,\" Just because the cameras say that there is no life on Mars, doesn't mean that there is no life.\" To prove that wrong, it states in paragraph number 11, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" Also later on in the paragraph, \"...if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian pyramids... you could see what they were.\" Meaning if there was any 3-d image, it would have been picked up and been able to ananlyze. The Face is obviously a natural landform that has been there from the beginnging. Also, people used to say and still say \" look at the man on the moon.\" There is no man on the moon, there is a mesa that was shaped that looks like a Face. The Face n Mars is just another incident of what happend with the moon.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform like the one here on earth and the one that appears on the face of the moon. I strongly hold my belief that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform because there is almost an exact replica here on earth, there are no sientific signs of life, and the pictures that were taken, that have been analized, show that shadows create the face. Will there one day be life somewhere else besides Earth. I will never know, but as of right now and the scientific records that are based on this essay, this Face that people say might be made by aliens is not logical. This Face on Mars is a mesa. Once you can find scientific data that proves there is life on earth, than everything said for years ca be proven wrong. But as of right now, no.",

Ever since the Face was discovered it has become a pop icon. The article I found said \"The \"Face on Mars\" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and has even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.\" The article also said \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" The only people that are saying anything about the Face and if it's made by aliens are conspiracy theorists.\n \n Also, NASA has captured better pictures but people still believe it was aliens.

There was no alien monument after all.\" The article also said \"What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms commom around the American West.\" NASA took clear picture of the landform and found out that it's just a landform.\n \n Although, the second time NASA took the pictures it was cloudy, so they could be trying to hide something. The text said \"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" So NASA could be trying to hide something by taking the pictures during the time when there's that type of weather.\n \n However, NASA wouldn't lie about this kind of discovery because it would also be very helpful for them. The text said \"We felt this was important ot taxpayers,\" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" The article also said \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Garvin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height and the Face on Mars.\" The Face isn't made by aliens or anything of that sort. Even if people wanted to it to be something the Face is just a landform.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just a landform it's not an alien artifact or anything else. The only people saying it was made by aliens are conspiracy theorists. The Face is just a landform that had the perfect lighting to make it look like a face. I know conspiracy theorists think it's something else but the information and facts are clearly stated.",

It sates in the article that \"Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\"\n \n and not only that but, \" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.\n \n However though, it states in the article that \" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars\" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that \" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that \" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the \"conspiracy theorists\" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.\n \n To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the \"Face\" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars. I think that the information that i have presented you with would go to show and prove my theory right.",

    Essay: "Is it a natural formed face or is it made by aliens? I'm a scientist telling you that it is a natural form rock. There are a couple reasons on why it is not made my aliens. It will be provided in the next three paragraphs.\n \n The first reason is, that we here at NASA caught an image of a face in 1976 by viking 1. At first we thought it was an alien or a face made by aliens. Then in 2001 we found the same picture of the face, but got a better veiw and a better picture quialty of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the first one. Whe the imaged appeared on JPL web site, reavealing that is was a natural landform, not a face made by aliens.\n \n We did some more tests to be sure that the landform was really a landform or if it was a face made by aliens. We figured out that is was a natural landform.\n \n That is was not an alien monument after all. We tried to find it again but it was hard.\n \n There are no such thing as an alien. This was the reason why there no such things as aliens. We will be doing even more research, thank you.",

        "Have you ever wondered where your best friendÂ was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.\n \n Signing up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve rackingÂ but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friendÂ was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.\n \n Theres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after schoolÂ activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.\n \n Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friendsÂ of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.\n \n My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.Â Â",

        "Our principle has recently stated to all the students of SCHOOL_NAME that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity. Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.\n \n Musical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.\n \n Musical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as wellÂ as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.\n \n Another great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.\n \n Finally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.\n \n I stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.Â  Â Â  Â",

        "Students should be able to choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not for many reasons. Most students are busy and don't want added pressure on top of school work. While kids may want to do extraculliculars they may do out of school activities that can take up their time, or they might have a family to take care of. Many students also a lot of time for homework, which they won't get the time for in an extracurricular.\n \n A reason students student's may not want to do an extracurricular is because they might have out of school obligations. If a student was babysitting or tutoring someone, they wouldn't have time to do extraculliculars because they'd be busy doing another job. It would be unfair to force someone who has another job to do more work, which is why they should have the choice to do an extracurricular activity.\n \n Furthermore, some students could have a family to take care of when they get home. For example, if a student has a younger sibling that needs to be picked up from the bus stop, the student would have to help with that. If they were forced to do an extracurricular, they wouldn't have time to take care of their sibling.\n \n In addition, quite a few students would need more time to do homework, which an extracurricular would prevent them from doing. While some students can finish their homework quickly and have enough time for another activity, a student who takes a long time shouldn't be rushed into doing something else. If they need more time to do their homework, they shouldn't be dragged into doing an activity.\n \n In conclusion, students have out of school activities, family to take care of, and a lot of homework which can make it hard for them to focus on extracurricular activities on top of it. All in all, there are many reasons a student might not want to do an extracurricular. Because of this, a student should be able to have a choice to do another activity or not.",

        "Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.\n \n Requiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social.Â Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.\n \n These activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.\n \n Another benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students.Â When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.\n \n In conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",

        "Does sitting inside and doing nothing but homework and chores all day sound exciting? Or would you rather have an opportunity to do fun activities with other people, making friends and improving your health along the way? If the latter sounds like the more appealing option, than you should support our principal's decision to make taking an extracurricular program mandatory. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is the perfect choice for our school. That is because it opens up new and unexpected opportunities, provides an outlet to make new friends, and helps improve your physical and mental well being.\n \n You should support the requirement of an extracurricular because it opens up fun and enjoyable activities that you might not have come across if not for this new policy. A very sporty kid might never know that he really enjoys being on the student council unless he tries it, and it is unlikely that he would try it any other way. The same thing works inversely, a book-smart kid could really have a great time playing basketball or football and never know it unless he tries it. The new opportunities can also help your in-school life by helping you learn about certain topics that you are struggling in or by providing service hours to contribute towards your required amount. The activity would also be a place to go every time you would rather not go home or if you just preferred to stay after school with your friends.\n \n The same way that this policy provides an outlet to new activities that you might not have found otherwise, it also paves the way to making you friends that you wouldn't have been friends with in any other situation. If you are a new addition to a certain group and you feel lost with how much more accustomed everyone else is to the group, you could make friends with an elder statesmen type of the group, in a mentor-apprentice kind of way. Many times, you could find people who are in the same situation that you are. If you got to know them and started working together with them, you could both benefit by learning how the group works. Overall, it would just be a fantastic way to gain friends, especially with people who are having a hard time getting to know new people.\n \n Another great way that this program is going to help is how it improves your physical and mental health. School can get very stressful at times, and the amount of homework, studying, test-taking, and other school things on top of the everyday teenage problems that you have can start to feel draining, like a heavy weight being pushed down on you. Extracurricular programsÂ relieve a lot of that stress by being a place where you can slow down a little bit and be more involved in things you actually enjoy being involved in. The physical activities, such as baseball or basketball, are a great place to get some exercise in to improve your physical life. A lot of students this age have it rough in that they might not have a lot of friends or people to talk to, so just a simple activity like the yearbook club could help relieve an immense amount of emotional weight off of that student by actually giving them someone to talk about their problems to.\n \n The intelligent choice by our principal to make at least one extracurricular program mandatory is an incredibly beneficial choice to all who are involved. It is a policy that gives people new chances to find something that they like doing, helps students make friends with people that they likely wouldn't have otherwise, and improves the physical and mental health of those students who need the improvement. If you are for the well-being of students and the developmental growth of the people who are the future of our nation, then you should be for this policy.Â",

        "Do you ever wish that you could have the chance to do a fun activity during or after school? Some schools are making students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can start new friendships, and in could be fun.\n \n Doing extracurricular activities can start new friendships. If you find someone with the same interest as you, then you two may become friends. It can be hard for people to meet new friends, but if you find someone with a similar interest then it could be easier to become friends with them. Secondly you guys could do activities together. If you two were to both to play an instrument, then you could practice together. Doing an extracurricular activity could give you topics to talk about with friends. If your at lunch one day and you run out of things to talk about, your extracurricular activity could be a good topic. If you miss out on an opportunity for an extracurricular activity, then you could be missing out on an amazing friendship\n \n Participating in extracurricular activities could be fun. first off there are field trips. Why wouldn't you want to skip a day of school and hang out with friends on a fun field trip? Also you get to do something you enjoy. It can give you a little extra time doing what you love. Lastly it can open up new opportunities. Things like band and orchestra may have festivals or auditions that you could do. Extracurricular activities can give you lots of chances to have fun, and enjoy school a little more.\n \n However, some people may say that students will lose interest. They say picking the wrong topic could lead to a year of being board. This could make students dislike the class or not want to go to it. Although, most students say that they enjoy their extracurricular activity, and even if its not their favorite class, they don't dread going to it. For example if a student liked science class more than yearbook, that doesn't mean that the student doesn't want to go to school. But if a student really didn't like the class, then they would know in the future not to pick it again. It would at the least give a student direction on if they would want to do that activity again. Even though people say that kids will lose interest in the activity they choose, students will always be able to get something out of it.\n \n Having to do an extracurricular activity could lead to new friendships and a year of fun. Being able to experience a extracurricular activity can be a great way to open yourself up to new things, and try different activities. You'll never know what you missed out on if you don't take an extracurricular activity.Â",

        'Across the nation, nearly 98% of schools have offered extracurricular activities for their students, but less than half of that 98% have mandated participating in one. In many schools worldwide, extracurriculars have been known to both help and hurt students - they can lead to staying up late making up for lost time, or they can lead to winning awards and even scholarships. Overall, I believe that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities... and I think you might just agree.\n \n First of all, mandating that students participate in after schoolÂ activities could improve kids\' work ethic. In fact, a study titled ""Extracurriculars and Students"" by Professor James Wood at UVA proves this. Wood found that 65% of students who participated in extracurriculars said they enjoyed the additional challenges that were presented to them, and actually continued to work harder and challenge themselves not only in their education, but also in the workforce. This means that teens and kids who entered after schoolÂ clubs and sports teams worked harder and were able to learn how to overcome obstacles and challenges. This also goes to show how students that entered extracurricular activities did indeed improve their work ethic. In general, I think you\'l find that this is important because it shows how adolescents were able to benefit from after schoolÂ activities.\n \n Secondly, requiring students to join extracurricular activities could help students get into better colleges. Don\'t believe me? Well, a statement released by Harvard University said that 80% of colleges look for (and accept) students who participated in one or more extracurricular activities. To put it simply, after schoolÂ activities have been known to assist students in getting into better schools. This relates because it shows how kids and teens who entered after schoolÂ activities could manage getting into excellent colleges and create a better future for themselves. This matters due to how it shows that extracurriculars can broaden the horizon for students.\n \n But that\'s not all. It\'s actually been shown that clubs and teams could improve a students\' health. A professional from Johns Hopkins said in an interview, ""...Students who participated in activitiesÂ after schoolÂ were reported to have a better attitude, more motivation in and outside of school, and possessed an overall healthier lifestyle than their peers who did not join any extracurriculars."" In other words, adolescents who joined activitiesÂ after schoolÂ tended to be in better condition than those who decided not to participate in any clubs or join any sports teams. This displays how students have been able to thrive and even better themselves thanks to extracurriculars. Overall, I think you\'ll find this important because it shows how kids and teens can greatly benefit from after schoolÂ activities.\n \n However, some might argue that students should not be mandated to take part in extracurricular activities, and say that teens may already have a ""full plate"" and thus become stressed. A statistic from the Teens and Mental Health Welfare Society revealed that 48% of students who participated in after schoolÂ activities reported an increase in stress levels. To put it differently, close to half of the kids they talked to felt stressed due to their extracurriculars. This also demonstrates how a few students are actually pressured by their after school activities. Ultimately, extracurricular activities may stress students.\n \n While that might be true, there\'s no denying that after school activities can also teach kids to lessen their stress by learning to budget their time. In fact, I personally was able to learn how to budget my time between school, family, friends, and extracurriculars. While I didÂ have a lot on my plate at first, my extracurriculars like sports, newspaper, and a few of my other hobbies enabled me to learn how to equally set aside time to complete all of my tasks in a timely manner, and still have time to relax. To put it in an alternate way, my after school activities were able to teach me an important skill that I\'d be able to use for many years to come. You\'ll see that this shows that, truly, extracurriculars can teach students how to budget their time effectively. Ultimately, my extracurricular activities taught me an important life skill that could benefit me in many area of my life.\n \n In the end, I think that we should mandate participating in extracurriculars, as it could improve kids\' work ethic, assist students in getting into good colleges, and even keep them healthy. Imagine a school with no after school clubs or teams offered to students; kids would be bored, unhappy to go to school with no chance to socialize or get active, and, most importantly, no chance to broaden their horizon and truly reach their full potential.',

        "Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity such as a sport or a club. I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because it helps build friendships, raise your low grades, and allows you to experience new things.\n \n The first reason after school activities are beneficial is that they can build a strong and lasting friendship. I remember when I was in elementary school and my mom signed me up for afterÂ schoolÂ basketball. The first few days and even weeks I hated it. I had no friends there or even someone I had seen before. I was scared and shy. Most of the kids were way older than me and looked huge. Most days I sit on the sideline watching them, wishing I could be that good. Suddenly the tallest kid of them all walks up to me and asked if I would like to join them in a game. I was in shocked and happy at the same time. I told the boy I would love to join. every day after that for three years I played with them after school. Eventually me and that boy became best friends and didnt do anything without each other. We played basketball together, watched movies, played cops and robbers, and had sleepovers. Five years later we are still best friends.\n \n The second reason after school activities are beneficial is because they can help raise your grades and test scores. Studies show that students who participate in homework clubs and study clubs generally have higher test scores. This means the students who have higher grades can get into better colleges, and students in better colleges can get higher paying jobs. From just attending after school homework clubs students have already made a step towards their goals of getting a good high paying job to support their family.\n \n The third reason after school activites are beneficial is because they allow students to experience new things. At my middle school we have so many different clubs and activities that everyone can find something they enjoy. I wish I could experience every single club we have but that is just not possible. Before I joined the cooking club I could only use a microwave and toaster. The amazing teacher taught me how to bake and make really fancy dishes for family gatherings or holidays. Before this class my Mom and Grandma cooked for Christmas. Now that I am able to help it feels wonderful because it is more time that I can use to bond with my family and friends.\n \n In conclusion I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because they are great places to build friendships, improve your grades, and experience new things.

The friends you make in school, might have a chance to grow up to still being one of your best friends. Making new friends can help increase your social life and have someone to talk to. Studies show that people that have many friends, tend to live longer, and have a happier life. But people that have don\'t have any friends, shows that they don\'t live as long. Doing clubs can also have a chance to make many friends. By doing drama club, theater club, or a robotics club, new people that you meet might have the same interests as you, and the two can share things they like to do and do as a hobby. This creates bonds with other people and groups. These bonds can eventually create friendships.\n \n Doing sports in something people really like to do as a hobby. They can be physical sports or non-physical sports that they can participate in. People also like to be active in clubs such as the yearbook club, drama club, or even the robotics club. Extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and active, so students can have fun. Competing in sports is something athletes enjoy because of the competition with the other teams, and to see who is the better team. Clubs also compete with other clubs, including the robotics club. They build their machine, and then they compete to see which school has the better machine. Being active in activities would be fun for all students because they involve students being active and having them do fun activities.\n \n By doing many activities may spark someones mind that they want to do what they want in the future. If a student does drama club or theater in school, they mightÂ try out for the activity in high school, or do a play as their career. If a student plays football in middle school, they might try out in high school and get a scholarship to play in college. Then, they can get drafted into the NFL as their career. It\'s a hard task, but anything you put your mind to, you can do it. If the student doe not want to play a sport, be in the yearbook club, or do drama, they can run for student council. This may have the student want to run for student council and win. Running for student council includes many things you would to in other activities, including competition, planning,and confidence. This may have the student be interested in politics. They could even run for an election when they grow up.\n \n In conclusion, I think it would be a great idea for the principal to have all student participate in extracurricular activities. In addition, I was on the track team for two years an I made many friends because of trying out. I also got to learn more about sports and I know many people would want to do these activities for a career. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.

        "The Principal is making all the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity and while some people may think that this is the greatest thing,and that they are going to love it,others may think that this was a huge mistake and that they won't do any good for them. I think that people need to try an extracurricular activity to get a feel for it. Sure some students may try out for a sports team or a team in general,but they are never finding out their true potential and will leave it in the dust. I think the Principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity because you can make friends,find something you didn't know you were good at till now,and make a living out of it.\n \n The principal should let everyone take a extra curricular activity is because you can make new friends. You can make new friends by talking to the people in your activity. You can find people and become friends by talking to them,becoming really close to them,and becoming friendly with them. You can also find people that you have in common. There's people that I have met that have the same likes,interests,and dislikes,and we became really great friends just by having a few things in common,so you guys should try finding someone and seeing if you have a lotÂ of things in common with him or her. You can also find your future best friend or your soon to be best friend. You can find a person,hit it off with them,and become best friends in the long run just because of that one extra curricular activity. In conclusion I think you can make new friends in a extra curricular activity by being friendly,finding people who have the same likes and dislikes as you,and find a best friend.\n \n Another reason the Principal should let students take one extra curricular activity because you might find something you didn't know you were good at. You can find something you didn't know you were good at because of the many options that schools have. Over fifty activities in schools around the world! From basketball,soccer,and football,form even cooking. Schools have something that might suit you. So if you don't like soccer or any sports,there's always cooking or Cosmetics. You can make teams and become popular and active. For sports such as soccer and softball,you can make the teams and get popular making a lotÂ of friends in the process. You can make money by trying out for a sport. Once you get into high school,you can earn credits and even a college application which saves a lot of money. I think we should take an extracurricular activity because they have many options,you can be active and popular,and you can make or save money.\n \n I think everyone should take at least one extra curricular activity because you can become know for the best basketball or best soccer player one day. Kobe Bryant and Micheal Jordan are perfect examples of people who started in basketball in probably high school as a extra curricular activity,to one of the Greatest players of all time. On the other Extra curricular activity come off as useless and leftÂ in the dust. People just take it for granted and just want the easy A.They don't try to discover their true potential and leave it in the dust. I think that an extra curricular activity is fun and may or may not get you famous,but on the other hand people just seem to abuse it's power.\n \n In conclusion I think that the principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity just because if how fun it is. Taking an extra curricular activity means that you can make new friends and best friends,do something that you didn't know you were good at till now and become popular and active,and be famous just like other famous people around the globe. But one the other hand people just seem to not care. In conclusion I think that the principle should let students take at least one extra curricular activity but not make it a rule so that other people will not feel uncomferable and forced to take an extra curricular activity.",

        "Imagine if you had to do an extracurricular activity at school with no say otherwise. Extracurricular activities are meant for a fun, optional, learning experience. Most schools offer activities for student interests. Students like the option of extracurricular activities because they can participate in their interests if they want to but it isn't mandatory like most other things in school. I disagree that students should be forced to do extracurricular activities because students should have the choice of what they want to do, most students are busy with other things outside of school, and students may not be interested in what their school offers.\n \n Students shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because they should have the choice of what they want to do. Schools offer activities so students can participate in things they want do, not have to do. Being forced to participate in things a student doesn't want to do can stress them out. Most things in school are mandatory so students like not feeling the pressure of being forced to do something. Making students participate in extracurricular activities can have benefits too. It would make them go out and do something and help them learn new skills. In the end multiple downsides outweighs a few benefits. While there may be benefits to forcing students to go and do something, in the end they should have their own choice of what they want to do or not do.\n \n Another reason why students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities is because most students are already busy with other things outside of school. Forcing more upon them would stress them out and make them dislike school. Students already dread each night they go home because of all their homework so making them have even more to do will over stressÂ them leading to depression and lack of effort. While it is good to challenge students to help them find their full potential, overworking them can lead to problems with their health and efforts during school. Extracurricular activities are supposed to make learning fun and help students learn new skills, not make them dread every day of school. Overworking students when they are already busy leads to anxiety and stress which is why extracurricular activities shouldn't be mandatory.\n \n The last reason why schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities is because some students may not be interested in what their school offers. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students discover what their interests are, not force them to do things they don't care for. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students know what they might be interested in doing in the future. If a student doesn't have interest in any of their schools options, they shouldn't be forced to do them. Some students may only have interests in things they can't do at their school. While some students might have interests that their school offers, not everyone does making it unfair for everyone to have to do an activity. If schools make students do things they don't want to, they will start questioning if their schools cares about their opinion or interests.\n \n In the end, students should have the choice of whether or not they want to do extracurricular activities since some are busy with other things and others aren't interested in what is offered. Overall, I have proved why I think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. Between being forced to do extracurricular activities and having a choice, having a choice is definitely the right answer. I chose that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they should be able to make their own choices, even if it isn't always the best answer.",

        "I agree because maybe it could lead to new friendships or relate ableÂ things or a thing with a teacher. For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activitiesÂ or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decidedÂ to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do. Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activitiesÂ at school or outside of school it's because they want you to feel like you've like accomplished everything in life and you've decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire. You might even find your furture date and be very distance get to know each other so I am agreeing because it causes friendships doesn't have to be home all day and some thing you might like.",

        "Sometimes, students all they want to do, is be on their phones all day and do nothing,i would recommend that students join an activity they enjoy, and effects them in their future career. In that case, I agree with the principal's decision, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons for my decision are students can become more successful,and they can prepare for what they want to be when they grow up.\n \n My first reason is, students can be more successful, and by that i mean better grades. nowadays kids grades drop really low because they are late to class,skip school,or don't pay attention, young teenagers miss a lot of information given by their teacher by not doing what they are supposed to. Staying after school with teachers can catch them up with their work, and help them achieve better goals.\n \n However,activities can prepare young adults, for what they want to be went they grow up. If the student want's to be a professional player they might as well join a sport and practice new skills. Or if a students want to be a chef like the pionneer woman that sells pans and utensils,they could join a cooking class after school. Or somehow they want to be an actor or actress,stay after for more practices in the Drama club.\n \n Wouldn't you want to see your kids graduating college with a master degree? Yes, every parent wishes that for their kids. In that matter students could join extracurricular activities,do community hours, prepare for what they want to be, and be successful.",

        'Why Extracurricular Activites Should Be Enforced\n \n What are ways that can help create a stronger and better student? The principal of Generic_School, Generic_Name, had an idea that will only help benefit and strengthen the students which is by assigning every student in the school with the responsibility of having to preform and maintain an extracurricular activity.\n \n Allowing and giving the students a place where they can spark new interests and express themselves can have a tremendous boost to their mental health along with their self-esteem because of the environment they placed themselves in, and the fact that they can express themselves. A recent study done in Harvard, said, ""93% of students that participate in extracurricular activities are 86% happier with themselves and others because the students are given a chance to express themselves, and feel safe from expressing themselves"". A reason that proves why its better for students to have a strong and penetrable mindset is that students with stronger mindsets tend to do better in school. According to a professor from Yale, ""Students with a good mental health do better in school because the students worry less and have a more positive mindset"". Both of these studies prove how beneficial it can be to assign the responsibility to every student of having to maintain an extracurricular activity because in the long run the students will be happier both with themselves and others, and have a better education, along with a stronger mindset.\n \n Students having to preform extracurricular activities can create new friendships, and bonds with people. An example of this would be if a student named Generic_Name was really into football and equally talented to the amount of love he has for the sport. Generic_Name tried out for the football team and he made the team and now played first string wide receiver. Throughout Generic_Name\'sÂ football season he created a lot of close friendships with his teammates because of their strong roots of interest when relating to football. Another reason that supports the thesis of extracurricular activities creating friendships is from a study recently done in Northern Virginia, from the University of Marymount. According to a professor named Albert Finkilstein, ""more then two thirds of people with similar interests become friends because of the mutual interests both parties share"". Albert Finkilsteins research proves that the extracurricular activities can sprout new friendships among the student population of Generic_School. However, a very important effect that pieces together why is is so important for friendships to be made is that students with more friends have a stronger education. According to a study done in Callasbases Florida, ""nearly 80% of students that have friends and are able to ask questions, share emotions with, and lastly feel comfortable with have a stronger education because students can rely on their friends for help with homework because students feel more comfortable asking questions to friends when compared to teachers"". Another positive affect of creating friendships is that there will be a better High School experience for the student because of the friendships made and the trust that was formed. Overall, with creating friendships from the extracurricular activities comes a stronger education, more people to rely on, and overall a better high school experience because of the friendships made and the comfortability made from creating those friendships.\n \n Forcing students to have to be able to balance school work along with an extracurricular activity can be very helpful in the idea of making students have to learn how to maintain efficient time management skills along with being more productive. One reason as to why extracurricular activities can be beneficial and help teach how to be productive of time to students would be that the students can\'t risk to have bad grades because the school of Generic_School is a prestigious private school meaning that the school only accepts the students with the best grades and the students that are willing to work the hardest. According to Generic_School, ""90 % of all students in the school have straight A\'s"", and, "" Any student that doesn\'t have all straight A\'s than can only have at the most three B+ and then the rest straight A\'s"". From how strict the school is with their grades it seems that they are very productive and efficientÂ since they only expect 110% all the time. However, it is easy to slip up or possibly fall behind and the best way to keep the productiveness flowing and for the students to do their homework every nightÂ is to never stop being productive which is why having an extracurricular activity is very beneficial because it helps teach all of the students how to maintain productiveness and how to have good time management skills. An example of a student being productive with their time would be to go home and do their homework, and to then think ahead and piece the amount of projects that could be coming up and when to do them and then align the upcoming work with days that they are free to do the work so that the students don\'t overwork themselves and instead get their homework done when it needs to be done and then spacing out the upcoming projects on days that they are free. Overall, having extracurricular activities can help students expand on being more productive, being able to have good time management skills, and space things along with being able to maintain such things.\n \n The strengths and effects that can be created with the idea of students having to maintain and participate in extracurricular activitiesÂ are improving students mental health, students creating friendships with one-another, and lastly, the idea of students having to learn to balance extracurricular school activities with school work along with learning how to create more efficient time management skills and being more productive.Â',

        "All students should have a decision if they want to play a extracurricular sport. One reason is that some students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and doing homework stuff like that. Next, reason is students might not like the sports that are given to play, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not given that much attention to school, because they are so into the sport they are playing. So, i think students should have a choice to play a extracurricular sport.\n \n One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, that they don't have enough time to play a extracurricular activity. Students might have a job to do after school, like working, have to babysit there sister, and get somebody off the bus everyday, etc. Students don't have enough time to do an sport, and have responsibilities to do too. Therefore, Students have responsibilities to do that doesn't require doing an activity that can take time away from doing that.\n \n Next reason is students might not like the activity given to play. Someone might not appreciate or like the activity they have to play, because they don't know how to play or just to lazy to play it with others. Students nowadays like to choice what they want to play not what others want them to play; because they might not like the activity given to them. For example they might have got picked to play soccer, they never played soccer so they may not like to play; because they never played that exact activity. Therefore, they should play what they played or seen get played by them or others.\n \n Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school. They are so focused on that one activity that they forget about what is happening around them. Students give so much attention into something not that much important as school and there grades. There grades are dropping because they skip half of class just to do an activity, they never make it up because so into what happened during that activity time. Therefore, school should come first before any sport and everything else avoiding that school time.\n \n In conclusion, students should have a decision to what they want to do for there after schoolÂ activity. One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and getting younger kids off the bus, etc. Another reason is students might not like that activity given to them, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school, because they are so into that activity. To sum this up no i don't think every student should have to play an activity if they don't like or don't have enough time, or not paying attention in class.",

        'Imagine every single student at your school is associated/participating in a sport, helping the yearbook committee, or even just serving on the student council because it could greatly impact the school by making it more organized and ""healthier"". Well thats exactly what my principle has decided to do. But not only can this change how there doing in school, it can also affect how they are struggling financially with all the fees they have to pay.\n \n Time plays an important role in this because a lot of students wont be able to fit an extra material into there daily schedules because there already jam packedÂ with other things they need to do throughout the day. This is also a little cruel for students because they would have to be occupied with numerous things at once and still remember to do other things. If the principles say that we must do an extracurricular activity, we wont have any time to do our own things. Students dont like to be stressed out and having to do lots of things at once. We already get tons of homework that some of us dont even finish because of the time we have isnt enough. So students might even stop turning in homework on time or even at all. Because focusing on other things has made it harder for them to keep up with school work. And then the student is blamed on for not doing it, but its not really there fault that they dont have enough time at home to finish everything. Students are getting the time taken away that they could use to do something that they enjoy like; spending time with there pets, relaxing, hanging out with friends etc. And that could affect how there school performance is going. Also they time they should be using as homework there turning in there free time because they dont have any other time for themselves.\n \n Money is also a problem in this situation because not everyone is going to have the necessary money needed to pay off the fees, or to get the materials needed for the activity they have chosen to do. But if the school offers to help pay the fees, then it would be a lot easier for those who need help financially. Im not saying they should pay the full price, but that they could help pay some of it, and the family getting helped does too;so that way they are both contributing. If money support isnt an option for them, then they just wont be able to participate and that should be blamed on the school not the family because its not their fault there struggling and cant afford to pay there children activities that the school says they ""must"" do. But whats the school going to do if they dont? suspend them? I think not.\n \n Most students wouldnt even want to participate in an extra curricular activity because they are already stressed out at home and have other things to deal with. Maybe the student is going through a rough time and doesnt want to be pressured into doing something extra thats just going to worsen there problem. So they shouldnt be forced to do something they dont want.\n \n Overall the schools shouldnt be doing this because its just a waste of time, money, and academic time. students already have a handful of things they need to keep up with for example: homework, they usually get it everyday with every class; that is already stressful enough. Religious activities like attending church or going to mutual, babysitting for friends or family, or even just spending time with friends,family and even pets. But with the school making us do other extracurricular activities, we wont have time do to what we enjoy and make us happy.Â',

        "I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.\n \n Participating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.\n \n An extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.\n \n I positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular.

        "I was in the hallways looking for an after school activity I couldn't find one that I liked or seemed interesting. The principal made it so that everyone has to do an extracurricular activity after school. I disagree with this decision.\n \n I disagree with this decicion because some people just don't get along with others and those activities require them to talk to people they may not like. Some people are shy and get nervous talking to people. Others are rude and don't like people in general, and people don't want to talk to them. Some people just can't make friends because they're funny looking. People like those anime kids probably can't make friends either because they stay hissing at people and having crushes on cartoon charaters. People can be depressed and not want to do anything after school just go home and lay in their bed the rest of the day.\n \n If someone has do to a sport because there is no other activities to do them they won't enjoy what they're doing. Even if they end up liking it they are doing it for fun not because they want to win everygame. Also is it's a sport you are making thwem spent their money on something you forced them to do. They could have used that money for something that they actually need like food or for paying their bills but no you want them to pay for a jersey, shoes, special socks and they didn't even want to do the sport in the first place. Their family could be really struggling to pay the rent and you want them to give you $100 for a jersey.\n \n Some people might not even enjoy being out doors or they might not be in the mood to be doing stuff like that they just want to go home to their dog or to their nice and comfertable bed but no you want them to spend more energy on after school stuff and teachers already complain about how some kids never do their work and thye dotn care what the excuse is. Someone could say \"\"Sorry I couldn't do my homework my grandpa died yesterday\"\" and the teacher would say \"\"that's tough you should have done before he died you had time then didn't you\"\" and with everyone doing after school activities there is no time for homework because you get home around six or seven then you eat because you must be starving then you take a shower and boom it's time to sleep and you got no homework done.\n \n I disagree with the decision to make everyone have an after school activity becuase not everyone has time or the personality to be hanging out with random people everyday after school. Some people might be depressed and others can't make friends. Not everyone has the money for supplies they need for their activity. That's why not everybody should be in an extracurricular activity.",

        "Did you ever have an extracurricular activity or also known as an after school activity in school? Some students after school participate in clubs or sports like the year book, student council, or football. Now some schools they may require you to participate in an after school activity, and others may not. Personally i am against it because many students work after school, many students have no interest in any, and many students who dont want to be there will be a distraction to those who do want to be there.\n \n First there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. If they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. They may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. If you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.\n \n Secondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. Maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. Now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. If they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.\n \n Lastly it could cause stress. School puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. Have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. Some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. Some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.\n \n In conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. Now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. Its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.",

Then other people will remember you in life. I agree with the principal's approach because it can help you later in life, it can get you more involved with great things, and it can possibly make you famous.\n \n Participating in an extracurricular activity can help you later in life. It can help you because people would be there for you. More and more people will know you and help you out with the rest of your life. Basically what I'm saying is the more people know you the more it will help. Now that's how people know how bad you want help later in your life.\n \n Another effect of participating in an extracurricular activity is it will get you more involved with different activities. Just like the second paragraph this is one is great too. When you get more involved its good for you because you meet different people and famous people. Thats how it can help you later in life. When you participate in an extracurricular activity, its almost like the start of a new adventure.\n \n One more thing of participating in an extracurricular activity is that it can possibly make you famous. Now this is the best part of this adventure. How you can be famous from one thing just like that you ask? Well there are people watching you. You could be an National Football League star, a professional Newsreporter, or maybe the next President of the United States.\n \n Now I think people should agree with the principal's new approach because you could be the changer of this world. Even though you think you don't want to, you can still try it and you just might like it. The best part of being famous you are the boss, and you could change the country forever possibly. All you have to do is try an extracurricular activity. Come on try it people try it. You will miss out if you don't get more involved. It's not too late to agree with the principal's approach.Â",

Principals should make people participate in activities such as a club, sport, or student council\n \n It is good to have social interaction with peers. If someone stays in the house all the time, not going out anywhere, then they might not have a good chance at getting into a collage they wanted. Participating in extracurricular activities might give someone extra points for collage, or make them look good for a collage.

        "What if your principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity? How would you respond to that? Would you go against them or stand with them? My principal made that decision for our school and I am standing with him! Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school.\n \n Extracurricular activities are an extreme benefit and help to the community. Many clubs actually are made to serve and make changes to the community. However, many people believe that students shouldn't be the ones having to do extra work to help out. It isn't all about the changes or the service it also helps them come together as a community and accomplish things as a team. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community.\n \n Benefiting the students is another thing extracurricular activities do. Students learn many skills such as teamwork, leadership, and responsibilityÂ when they take part in these activities. Extracurricular activities teach students many things that they wouldn't learn during school hours or class time. When the students take part in these amazing things, the build an even more amazing reputation for themselves. Many say that students will lose focus and interest in school when they take a part in extracurricular activities. But, in reality extracurricularÂ activities are the reason some students come to school and strive to do their best.\n \n Schools benefit a lot from extracurricularÂ activities. ExtracurricularÂ activities keep schools motivated and running smoothly. Many extracurricularÂ activities require competition this means they keep healthy competition going. Clubs and teams bring the school closer. Students feel as isn't just a place to do pencil paper work when they can actually do these things and them be associated with school. These activities surely are expensive on school. But, the experiences that they bring students are worth more than a million dollars.\n \n Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community. Extracurricular activities are the reason students are great leaders and strive to do their best. These activities help a school build their backbone and the way others see them as a whole. Wouldn't it be amazing if your principal made you take part in these activities!",

To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.\n \n First of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.\n \n In this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great.\n \n Going off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere!\n \n In conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people.Â",

        "You have so much to do! You have a pile of homework, youth group, errands, and, on top of that, you have to meet with a club that you don't want to be in. If you force someone to do things that they don't want to do, there can be a lot of negative effects. As a result, I don't think that participating in an extracurricular should be required because people who are forced to join something will probably not participate well, could get very stressed and overwhelmed with the extra load, and people who are not already in a club have multiple reasons to not join.\n \n First off, if you aren't able to find an extracurricular that you like, you could be forced to join one. Then, if you're forced to join a club that you do not like, that could hinder the group's progress and work. For example, if someone who doesn't know how to play lacrosse joins the lacrosse team, some people would be angry. Especially if the new person doesn't want to play and doesn't know how. They are most likely diving headfirst into the sport without learning the rules. That means they wouldn't know how to check correctly, wouldn't know defense or attack, and wouldn't know the rules for scoring. On top of that, them not wanting to do lacrosse would ruin the team dynamic. We had a player one year who did not want to play on the defense, so she played the position as bad as she could, making the people who were trying to play well angry, and ruining our teamwork. So, if people don't want to participate in a club or sport, they might ruin it for everyone else, and that wouldn't be beneficial.\n \n Next, having an extracurricular on top of everything that you already have to do, like homework or family, could make you stressed and exhausted. I know for me that having lacrosse practice, Odyssey of the Mind, and homework every single day makes me exhausted. I enjoy playing lacrosse, and I enjoy OM, but when I get home from lacrosse after an hour and a half, and having done OM before that, I have exceeded my limits of activity for the day. All that I want to do is take a shower and go to sleep. If I have to do my homework and spend more time working, I will most likely be very tired the next day. With that, other people might have little siblings that they have to take care of, and being in a club, going home and doing their homework, and after that, taking care of siblings, will give them a lot of stress to do everything fast, making them rush their homework to make sure that their sibling are cared for, or neglecting their siblings to do their homework well. Juggling multiple responsibilities can impact stress levels, productivity, and time management.\n \n Finally, people who are not in a club can have multiple reasons not to be in a club. You could choose not to be in a club because your parents can't pick you up afterwards, you have too much homework every night, you have siblings to take care of, etcetera. People who aren't participating in any extracurriculars just might not want the responisibility of remembering. Everyone has a reason, even if it's that it doesn't sound interesting.\n \n Joining an extracurricular should not be forced onto students. I think that if you force someone to do anything that they do not want to, they will not participate and that will come back around to you in negative ways.",

        "If my principle were to require every student to participate in an extra curricular activity, I would disagree. I choose to disagree because, some students might not have the time, parents or adults at home cant take or pick them up, money problems, students are needed at home and, they should be able to have the choice to participate in an extracurricular activity or not. I feel it is unfair to force all students to participate in an activity.\n \n Many students might not have the time to do an extracurricular activity. They could have a lot of homework they must do or, they could be busy doing other things. Parents might also not have the time to bring their kids to the activities and pick them up as well. Many parents work and they might even work until late. How would they be able to transport their kids to and from their activities? From my expirience, my parents are both really busy. My dad goes to work from early in the morning and doesn't get home until about 7PM. He's busy all day. Therefore, he wouldn't be able to to get my siblings or I from our activities. My mom also helps my dad at work, they're both really busy. She has to take my brother and I to our practices everyday then, pick us up. I myself am a busy person. I have practice 5 times a week and they're back to back. Sometimes I have to wait hours to eat and most nights I don't have enough time to do my homework. I go to sleep late and do it all over again the next day. You can't buy time or make it go by slower to get to and from those activities. It all doesn't fit into some peoples scheduals.\n \n Forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity isn't fair for a lot of reasons. Some students might not be interested in sports. Some might not be interested in being on the school council. Some might not be interested in working on the yearbook. Some just might not be interested in any of the activities that are provided. Everyone has different things they like or enjoy doing. Forcing students to do something they don't like, makes them feel uncomfortable or out of place, it isn't fair. It makes them miserable. Schools focus on including everyone but sometimes they don't include how a student feels.\n \n Money is also an issue. I know for a fact that participating in a sport isn't free. Nothing in this world is ever really free. We never know about a familys money situation but, it's important to keep in mind that some people struggle and that includes even providing food for their family. On top of that housing bills, other bills, insurance, taxes and savings is already a hassle for a family who is struggling. Adding activities that require a payment for an activity that a kid is forced to do is even more unfair and more trouble. It adds too much stress.\n \n In conclusion, forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity could be an inconvienance as well as unfair. Not a lot of good things come out of a situation like this. The negatives cancel out the positive.Â Â Â Â Â",

My principal says that students should attend any type of extracurricular avtivities. Such as art, sports, yearbook, and many more. I agree with my principal with his thought of choice.\n \n Having fun classes can really help student when they start having a ruff time in school. Class is really stressful for me and others when they don't understand something at school. My happiness is soccer, art, and writing. Those 3 things help me so much. So when i'm strugling the only thing I think about is doing something I know that will keep my mind off of it and will start to calm me down. Art is one of the best class anyone can take. I say this because art, is litearlly art. You can do art out of anger, stress, sadness, and even happiness. Litearally out of anything. If your planning on doing a new sport in high school it can build your stress to even it to be better. I would have to wait all the way until i get home to play soccer, but in high school you will have a period so you can do that sport or activity. You should'nt be forced to keep doing your work without a break from being overwhelmed.\n \n The more you practice the better you get. I understand when people say the more you study in school the more you understand. Thats not just for school work. It's also for these fun activities. Say you have never done a sport before, but want to start. You can do that in school and then when you sign up for the sport you want to do you will already be really really good, because all the practice you have got. Also, most people in middle school want to do a sport in high school. If you participate in that specific sport the coaches will see that you are really intrested in doing it. You can even do soemthing you never thought you would do, like Yearbok. Yearbok is a fun activityt and you can do a lot. The more you do it the best you get. That can be you new enjoyable hobby. No one ever knows what you can't do.\n \n Although, students being allowed to do a fun class during learning hours can get them to lose the thought of there work. Students should focus on school work and schol work only. Especially for those who want a good career in the future. You can actually make a lot of money from art. Art is a easy activity you can do for your whole life, and it will also lead you to big things. The most important thing in my opinion is to do something that will get you somewhere ahead of life. Doing that will help you sucseed within your future. Anyting you enjoy doing as an activity can get you somehwere.\n \n Extracurricular activities should be a new thing students at Hayfield should attend, and many more schools. I think that is a really good idea to allow for us students. No one should be stressed about someting that they need in life, what do you think?",

      essay:
        "Nearly over 78% of students participate in after school or extracurricular activities in the US as of today.\n \n While it is important for a young adolescent to become involved in some form of an extracurricular, to make something of the such mandatory is unneeded and inconvenientÂ for many. Taking part in a extra activities requires many resources which some people can't afford or simply don't have. For a student to become apart of something, it should be at their own free will and not because someone of higher status makes it not optional. With forcing these students into all of these different subjects and areas it can create issues with money for low income families, time consumption, student transportation, and student's overall mental health and happiness.\n \n With families who struggled with income or have budgetary issues, this new rules could be extremely challenging. For those who are on the free or reduced lunch plan, it's even more likely that they wont be able to place their child into an extracurricular due to costs. Activities such as sports, dance, theater, and clubs cost money, something many don't have much of. Whether it's to simply enroll your child in the sport, to pay for dance shoes, or to buy supplies it always comes down to some sort of price. Even if a family is not struggling with funding, many see it as unnecessaryÂ to spend money on something their child truly doesn't wish to participate in.\n \n It isn't uncommon for students who live in larger families with younger siblings to watch after the younger children. Many students who are apart of extracurricular often don't have this job nor need to be home earlier due to this reason. When students are forced to spend their free time at a practice or rehearsal, this creates conflict within the household dynamic. Without the children there to watch after their younger siblings or to perform everyday chores such as cleaning up after the house or tending to a farm if the student were to live in the more rural areas, it causes the family to have to search for daycare or hire an extra hand which is not only costly but also stressful.\n \n Not only is it time that is an issue, but transportation is also a main concern. Many parents or legal guardians travel and work for several hours, often getting home late. If children are at extracurricular while their parents work, this means there is no one who is available to pick them up or provide transportation to such activity or back home. While carpooling or busing may be an option in specific areas, this does not apply to students who do not have access to said buses or who live in extremely rural areas, further from the school or activity site.\n \n Joining an outside group or involving yourself in a social setting where one participates in a hobby may be healthy and is encouraged, but just because it is pushed for does not mean it should be mandatory. The decision to devote ones time, money, and effort to such a consuming thing should be a personal and willing choice. Forcing a student to become apart of the student counsel or to play a sport may seem like the healthy option and makes them involved in something, but sometimes this can be damaging to a student. If the child is unhappy with what they've been put into, and are forced to participate in this activity several times a week, it's bound to create some form of an issue with the student over time. It can cause depression or irritation, with one being forced into something that doesn't truly bring them joy which may both effect the students personal life and scholastic performance.\n \n Becoming apart of an extracurricular activity should be a free willing, and personal choice that fits for both students and their families. This should revolve around the students wishes and not those of someone who does not know each child's personal situation. Forcing one into something they did not choose for themselves has very few positive effects and is bound to do more harm than good for each individual and their families. Enlisting each and every child into activities outside of school causes too many conflicts with time, money, transportation, and a student's overall well being. Although it's encouraged to participate in an extracurricular, it should not be made mandatory for students.",

        "When going into middle school and high school, most students have the opportunity to pick extra curricular activitiesÂ such as sports, art, student council, and much more. These activitiesÂ give them a chance to incorporate their interested into their schedules. These classes are also often beneficial to the teenage mind while they are trying to grow and explore themselves. However, should extracurricular activities should be required? Without extra curricular activities, it is harder for teens to have the opportunity to be apart of their community. They also help teens branch out, be creative, and make new friends. Extracurricular activities gives students more independence and freedom to structure their own schedules, which can get pretty busy and full of school work! Some teens, however, don't see the benefit of extracurricular activities during middle school or high school and still need a little push to get involved. Students should be required to take an extracurricular activities because, it forces them to be an active citizen who is part of the community, it gives them anÂ opportunityÂ to takeÂ theirÂ mindÂ off of school, and it pushes them to go out of their comfort zone and try something new.\n \n Requiring teens to take an extra curricula activity will help them become more involved in their school and local community, which is an important part of their lives. The average school community is made mostly of the student, so their involvement in the school is vital, even more so then the teachers. Not only does extracurricular activities help in school involvement, but it gets teens a head start to be involved in their local communities too. For example, some high school cheer leadingÂ teams not only cheer at school sports events, but cheer at town or county events. Also, lots of school art classes have their students work displayed at local shows or even just around the school building. In addition to that, lots of musicalÂ groups preform at school concerts and go to state competitions. These are only a few of the options, but almost all extracurricular activities work to get their students involved in the community. By enforcing extracurricular activities you enforce an involved lifestyle at a young age which is a skill teens can carry with them for the rest of their lives.\n \n Not only do extracurricularÂ activities make students lives part of the community, but takes their minds of of their stressful school life. After a long day in school students are often forced to go home and do even more school work. Teens minds are consistently on school, grades, tests, and homework. School can create an unhealthy amount of stress, especial for teens who are still growing up. It is also easy to get sucked into over working and over worrying about grades and a good GPA. Having extracurricular activities normally gives them at least an hour of time to de-stress themselves every day. Not only do they get this time to distress, but also to put their energy into something they love! It is a huge change from sitting in a classroom trying to pay attention all day. Student need this time and this outlet do things that make them happy. Requiring extracurricular activitiesÂ will give all student the chance to de-stress and take their minds off school work, especially when it becomes unhealthily over whelming.\n \n Lastly, requiring teenagers to branch out and try something new threw extracurricular activities can introduce them to new opportunities and teach them a valuable life lesson. Teens often fear trying something new or coming out of their shells. These fear often come from the fear of not being accepted or the fear of failure. Unfortunately,Â while trying to figure out how to fit in, teens can take the wrong path and become a bully or put themselves in danger. Extracurricular activities teaches them how to try new thing in a safe way. Breaking the ice between groups of people can be very hard and is something that most teens fear they will fail at, but it becomes a lot easier when they all share common hobbies. Extracurricular groups are like built in friends, or at least a group of people that have shared interests. Learning how to try newÂ things, even tough it might seem scary is an important lesson that will helps teens for the rest of their lives. In conclusion, extra curricular activities will teach teens how to branch out and try new things, a skill that they will use even in adulthood.\n \n Teaching teens how to become part of their community, take their mind off of school, and try new things, are all benefits to requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities force kids to not only be involvedÂ at school, but locally in their town and city. They also let kids have a built in break from the stress that school brings. Finally, they teach kids the valuable life lesson ofÂ trying new things. Most teens are just trying to figure out who they are before beingÂ thrown into the life of adult hood. For many, however, they don't want to identify as the average teen who sits in a classroom all day. It is important to give students things like extracurricular activities so they can celebrate what makes them unique. Extracurricular activitiesÂ aren't just a club or a group of people, it is an outlet to be yourself.Â",

        '""Ughhhh,"" said Generic_Name, ""I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!"" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. ""Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?"" Generic_Name questioned, ""well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school,"" Generic_Name\'s Mom replied. ""I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, dont you think so Mom?"" Generic_Name said, ""I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there,"" Generic_Name said, ""sure honey, I think thats the best idea ever!"" Generic_Name\'s Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.\n \n First, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at leastÂ one school activity tend to be more self confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self-confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self-confident.\n \n Second, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becomingÂ a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.\n \n Third, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high-school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.\n \n Imagine, you have just made your high-school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. Your a great, wise person that everyone looks up to and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouth-watering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.',

Such as, participateing in sports,work on a yearbook, or serve as a student council.\n \n Who would want to do a extracurricular activity when we already have seven hours of school that's over working us. If we have that added on to school a lot of students will be going to sleep in school. Studies show that in the U.S. 45% of students is going to sleep in school. So, why would you add an extra activity\n \n So it can waste more of our energy? So we can go to sleep faster?\n \n I strongly advise everyone not to do any type of sports. You will get sore from pratice,injured,break a bone, tear your A.C.L. or worser. Lke in football you can get seriously injured. Why yall want us to do a type of sport we can ge injured in? Studies show that 58% of students get injured by Participating in sports.\n \n We should just and learn then to do the extracurricular activity.

Matter of fact you can just just select five or six people to do yhe yearbook it's no point of makeing it an activity. By the way way why start this early you should wait until June.\n \n Serve as a student council? That's not even an activity that's just for one person so, why should that even be included as an activity? That's not a reason why everybody in the whole school do an extra activity in the school. That's just for that one person. That's not an reason why we should miss out of learning because of an student council.

        "Should the principal be allowed to force decisions on their students? While this may lead to some poor decisions, it would be better in the long run. \"\"Why?\"\" you say, you see 70% of kids don't do social or physical activities of any kind, and suffer as a result. There are also a lot of times where kid's are forced to do something new and then end up liking it. Something they never would have done they liked. Along with that, putting kid's through these programs could also give them valuable life skills. Overall, I do think that the principal, or whoever is managing the school, should be allowed to force these programs upon kids.\n \n My first point I'm going to list is that it get's them doing something. Like I said a lot of kids don't do anything by themselves, and around 2/3 of them have less than three friends. There is a whole outside world waiting for them. It is also noted that these kids more often than not have great talents, which are just waiting to shine. With a stronger school, getting them to go outside, and participate in activities such as clubs, school teams, and the student council would be easy and beneficial, and some of these benefits would be stronger and smarter kids, and more school funding for these programs.\n \n The second reason I think this should be done, is because of practical reasons. The goal of the school is to cram as much as they can into the student before the year's end. They could also set up after school activities straight after school to do this even better, along with this would help students who don't have parents or guardians at home. Whether this would be mandatory or not is one sided, it must be mandatory. Another practical reasons this should be done is that it would allow more time for the teacher and student to interact helping with the normal school day and settling any problems.\n \n One thing other people might say is that it would increase costs, and that the school shouldn't be messing with the student's childhood. Both of those accusations are wrong. Doing these has been shown in several studies to not be very expensive, and is literally just a step up from end of day clubs. The second point isn't true either, the school is a part of the student's childhood, and they should be embracing it. Younger generations haven't learned what and what not to do yet, and the school can help them decide.\n \n In the end, I do think that the principal should be able to force activities like these upon the students, to improve their live skills, and maybe provide a bit of fun. Of course, the United States is a republic, so it all depends on the parent's, but I do think they will agree with what I say, that children shouldn't be sitting in their bed all lazy, but be making important life choices.\n \n Now what do I think you think of this? Even if you are just a student, and not a parent of teacher who already knows all the benefits, it is for your personal future, and it will be better for you. Tell other people about this idea, and eventually it will be national education.",

She finally arrivesÂ with a hungry smile and cruel eyes and says,""Generic_Name did you do your homework?"".""No i did not teacher because I had no time due to the outrageous rule that the principal made that made it mandatory that all students participate in one extracurricular activity."" Her eyes gleamed with anticipation as she gave Generic_Name an F and walked off to seek her next victim. The rule that dictates that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity is a mutiny and should be abolished at once because,students can use the extra time for more beneficial uses such as doing their homework or catching up on some sleep,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will notÂ benefit them.\n \n The first reason why the rule that states that you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be nullified is,that students can use the extra time for more productive purposes such as doing homework or catching up on some sleep. When i was younger I used to participate in writing club and when I would come back home I would be drained. I would have no energy to do anything so the majority of the time my assignments went incomplete and turned into zeros. One day the teachers started noticing the lack of turned in assignments and called my parents for a parent teacher conference. the teachers brought me and my parents to a table wearing serious expressions. The teacher said,""Your son has displayed superior thinking skills but the lack of turned in assignments astounds us."" My parents replied by saying,""Our son gets back everyday from writing club extremely tired and does not have the time or energy to do his homework."" they came to a conclusion to cancel writing club for me and then I started turning in my homework on time. 44 percent of homework is not completed due to lack of time. If you say that they can do their homework when they get home after the extracurricularÂ activity I would say that kids are not fully developed adults yet and dont have as much energy or stamina and cannot function after long periods of time.\n \n The second reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be abolished is,that schools do not specialize in what club or sport that they offer and they will not teach it as well as the facilities that specialize in what they are offering. Its not the schools job to provide extra clubs they can offer clubs but they should not be able to force you to join a club. If a child wants to play a sport or endorse an activity, he can go to an outdoor club or facilityÂ that specializes in what the child wants to do. When i was eleven years old,I played on my school soccer team. The coach did not know how to play soccer and I hated it. I never got any better and I almost quit soccer then and there,but I went home one night and told my mom about it. She said,""You should try UCLA Soccer I read about it it\'s very interesting"". I tried it out the very following week it was amazing,I loved it and,I have been playing soccer ever since. If you say that the school clubs can also be good at teaching what they do I would tell you that a school club will never be as good at teaching a sport or activity than an actual facility that specializes at the given sport or activity.\n \n The third and final reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activities must be abolished is,that if you force the kids to choose from a limited set of sports and clubs they might not like any of the activities that you are offering and because of that they will never practice what they are being taught and will never get better at what they are being taught. If a person does not like what they are being taught 98 percent of the people will not practice the subject or sport they do not like. If you dont practice what you are being taught you will never get better at what you are practicing and will never succeed at it. My cousin used to play karate and he hated it he would always pass the tests but he would never practice and as a black belt some of the blue belts that practiced were stronger than him. One day his mom asked him""Why arent you as good as some of the other students""? He replied by saying,""I dont enjoy karate like I used to and as a result,I don\'t practice anymore"".\n \n If you say that people at school can like the subject or sport they are being taught I would say that is the reason extracurricular activities should be offered but not forced.\n \n Generic_Name smiles at the teacher as she comes by ""Do you have your homework she asks""?""Yes ma am.""he replies with a grin. Ever since the rule that made extracurricular activities mandatory got abolished he has had time to finish all of his assignments and still had a little time for relaxation. I disagree with the principal\'s rule that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity because students can use the time for more beneficial purposes,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will notÂ benefit them.',

        "Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so why not satiate all three by participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wideÂ joy by solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!\n \n Firstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved by participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached by all participants makes the friend-finding process much more simple. ExracurricularsÂ alsoÂ provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel they don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel they do.Â Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability by building support systems has never been more important.\n \n Next, parents may find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school may not have to do that anymore, at least for a day or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new foundÂ friends to get home.\n \n Finally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!\n \n In SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.\n \n Extracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires joy in people is always a good option. Starting with extracurricular activities is a great option!",

        "Imagin that you are participating in more than one activity and you do not have time to focus on your other school work. Its better for students participate in one extracrricular activity because it help students them to consertrate on their other school work. Participating on one activity can also be entertainment , but some student thinks one activity is not enough for them. In my opinion, participating in one extracurricular activity is termenously and entertainment for students.\n \n Frist, participating in one extracurriclar activity can help students on their others subjects or doing their other school work. For example, if students particpates in more than one activity they can not focus on their other subject like math, doing thier homeworks and studing for thier tests. In addtion for students to focus or particpate on thier other subject is better for them to participate in one activity.\n \n Next, particpateing in one activity have a great impact on students. For example they can lrean new things and they can see how much distinguished are they on that activity. All activity are not easy some are diffcult and some of them are easy but we have to try our best.\n \n Furthermore, students should particpate in one extracurriclar activity because they can complete their work on time. Another reason why is tremendously way for students to participate in one activity is it can help them to persuade a successful place in futuer.\n \n For example students are lucky to have one extracurriclar activity in porfusly schools student have more than two activity which is not good for them they can not complete thier work on time because of so much school work.\n \n I believe that participating in one extracrricual activity is a magnificent and better way for students.\n \n participateing in one extracurriclar activity can help students to focuse on thier other school works. It also help students to participate on only one actiity for example like sports students can put all their focus on only one activity.\n \n Its a great deal for students should to participate on one activity because they can complete thier work on time.Â",

        "Extracurricular activities are very important in a students life. They develop communication skills, social skills, and among others, your ability to work well with other people. On the other hand, they should not be required for all students to participate in. Although all students could possibly find something they're interested in when it comes to after school activities, such as clubs or sports, not all students are capable of handling the responsibilities that come along with an extracurricular activity. Have you ever come to the conclusion that not every student can even maintain good grades at school? For some children, it's harder to balance school work and their everyday life alone, but if you add an extracurricular activity to their plate of responsibilities, it may be too much for them to handle. For a principal to make extracurricular activities a necessity at school, is not very considerate. As an adult you must realize that not every person, let alone children, can handle the same work load as others can.\n \n Even though research has shown that extracurricular activities can be very beneficial for people, as it pertains to their physical, and mental well-being, it can also be damaging if too much work is placed upon one person alone. Stress is a very common factor in a child's life, and the majority of it is from life at home, and the excessive amount of work received at school. But in comparison, some kids can handle the load, and like the responsibility given to them. Not all children are like that though, and that is what the principal fails to realize. Although the principal may not have come to light about the amount of stress that could potentially be put on the students, the gesture to make the activities a necessity was most likely at their best interest at heart.\n \n For the kids that work well under pressure, or have the capability to handle the challenges they face, the change in the schools priorities for the students probably won't affect them as much. Although only one extracurricular activity would be required, not all students could be able to wisely manage their time to fit the activity in their schedule. Also, maybe not all students would be able to find something they enjoy with the options given at their school. If someone were to make it a priority for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would be extremely recommended for the person to make the activity choices an exceptionally wide variety, so that it is more likely for students to find the things they enjoy to do. With the exception of making sure that there would be an activity to match each students interest, the idea would not be too bad. But in the same breath, that'd require some type of survey or application of some type, that every student must take in order to find out their interests, so that way making the activities wont be as difficult. Although keep in mind, that not every student may want to participate regardless of whether or not there is an activity they might enjoy.\n \n There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouseÂ some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, \"\"average\"\" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand. But the idea as a whole would potentially cause a lot of stress to the principal, considering that not every child will have the same perspective on the idea, nor will their parents.\n \n Yes, the motion being taken will have several benefits, and several stressful altercations, but at the end of the day everyone is different, and not everyone is going to have the same opinion when it comes to this situation. Even though the principal is only asking each student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it still may be too much to ask of some kids, considering their life outside of school, and what they find important in their lives as far as activities go. But maybe enforcing this act could open not only the students' eyes, but the parents as well, that trying new things isn't always such a bad idea, sometimes we just need a little push to get us started. But despite all the possible benefits of the idea, it still probably shouldn't necessarily be a requirement for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know how much stress someone deals with just by handling their personal life, one activity may not seem like much to you, but for some people one activity could be a handful. Forcing the students to participate in activities that they may not like, could possibly lead to a decrease in social skills, instead of an increase. Â Â Â Â",

        "Every school contains extracurricular activities, from sports to clubs to the student council. These after school activities were created to entertain those students who wanted to learn or have fun with others while in a safe and comfortable environment. Although most schools don't force participation, it would be extremely beneficial if they did as extracurricular activities teach how to cooperate with others, allow students to explore things out of their comfort zone and meet new people and shows the crucial importance of time management.\n \n Learning teamwork and cooperation with your peers is an important thing to learn all throughout middle and high school. Being on a sports team or in a competitive club can show students how to work with each other and communicate accordingly. For instance, when on a sports team like volleyball, teamwork is essential. Each member plays an important role but that role cannot be correctly executed unless the other members are assisting. The hitter depends on the setter to give a sturdyÂ and high set in order to spike the ball and score a point, and the setter relies on the defensive line to give a high and straight pass in order to provide a good set. Communication and cooperation with one another is vital and can overall teach the players many lessons and prepare them for the future.\n \n Furthermore, extracurricular activities can also allow students to get out of their comfort zone to learn new things and meet new people. Schools contain numerous different clubs, one for each different crowd a student might fall into. There might be a club for music, books, movies, the environment, writing, or science and math, etc. Making sure students must participate in one of these clubs or activities can give them the push they need to realize a hobby they might not have known they had or meet a new friend they would have never talked to outside of the club. When I was new to my school, I didn't know anyone to well but once I joined cooking club, I learned many new things while participating and met brand new students too.\n \n Although some might argue that they might not have time for this after schoolÂ activity because of homework or chores, this decision made by the school can give students the chance to work on their time management. Time management is one skill that is very hard to achieve but is used almost all throughout your life. Managing school work, with the extracurricular activity, and whatever else they might have at home can allow students to work on this skill and apply it to real life.\n \n The decision stating that all students must participate in extracurricular activities can overall help them when it comes to their future. Giving these students the opportunity to socialize with peers and enjoy themselves can benefit them in too many ways to count, educating them and further preparing them for what's to come after high school and even after college as well. The countless different clubs and teams can allows them to learn to cooperate with others, learn and meet new people and practice their time management skills.Â  Â Â Â Â",

        "Our principle has decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity. Students can serve as student council, work on the yearbook, or even play a sport. I think this is a good idea or way for kids to express themselves. Here are some reasons why I agree with being apart of the activities.\n \n One thing you can do is work on the yearbook. You can also open up and help motivate others. Participating in something helps with many skills such as, communication and working with others. The yearbook could even have anonymous writers, if you want to say something and don't want everyone knowing who said it. Also taking photos of other activities around the school would even be great.\n \n Another extracurricular activity you could do is serving as student council. If you want to see changes in somethings you can step up and work as a council to make a difference. You could also get groups to hang up motivational quotes around the school. Sometimes, even having funds to raise money for the school would be a helpful idea.\n \n You can also play sports to participate in an activity. Playing sports gives you the time for you make new friends, do what you love, and even hang with your bestie. Finding a sport you like can be hard but giving it your all is the best you can do. You can even get scholarships to colleges. And being on a team is your best suport group, they are always there when you need them.\n \n In conclusion, I agree we should be in extracurricular activities. It gives us the opportunity to express our self and have fun doing it. They can also help try and change things to make a difference. The activities also have benefits for us and for school. All of these are reasons why we should participate in extracurricular activities. Â Â Â",

        "Being a teenager can be one of the best times of your life. As a teenager, I myself have participated in many sports activities and extracurricular activities in my free time. Although I am lucky enough to have experienced being in a club and on a sports team, other students may not have that opportunity.\n \n I believe that schools should require extracurricular activities, one of the reasons being kids social skills. Being put into different clubs or sports teams can help teens make new friends and provide a larger circle of students they can interact with on a daily basis. Being in those activities can provide new experiences those kids never thought to try. This can spark new interests and lead to students doing bigger and better things in their lives, and also help them with choosing a career path.\n \n This generation of teenagers has become addicted to technology and social media. Kids ranging from high school all the way down to preschool use technology on a daily basis. If schools require students to participate in an extracurricular activity, It will pull students away from social media and lead to a more productive way in them spending their time. Too much screen time can take a toll on young people's mental health and I believe that in having required activities, kids of all ages can focus on sports rather than their social media status.\n \n If school were to make extracurricular activities required, they would probably have to provide them for free. Schools can't force the parents to pay for extra activities, nor can some parents afford to pay for those activities. If the school covered the cost of everything the school would get more respect, because it would be showing they didn't just care about grades and they care about your mental health as well. If extracurricular were required it would be good for the school to get to fill up their clubs. For example, they could have more students in the yearbook club, which would improve the quality of the work they put into the yearbook.\n \n In the end I believe that having required extracurricular activities would reallyÂ make the school environment a happy and healthier place for students, teachers, and parents.Â",

        "Our principal has decided that every student must be at least one extracurricular activity. In my opinion ,I strongly disagree with the principals decision and I think students should have the option and freedom to choose whether they want to participate in school activities or not. So today I'm here to explain why this is a bad idea and hope you will agee with me as well.\n \n First of all,most students after school are busy, at least I know I am. When I'm done with school and go home I immediately get ready to go to the gym with my mom, I go to the gym at least 2 hours ,after that I go do my homework ,then prepare for my piano lessons at the community center ,and now adding an activity I'm forced to do my schedule gets pretty tight . Thats also a main reason why students dont go to school activities, they simply don't have enough time. But after the principals decision , students have to re-organize their schedules making them have less time to do the things they really want to do.\n \n Secondly , what if students don't like the activity they are forced to do. Yes, I know they are plenty of choices to choose from , but theres a chance students won't like any of them. It will make them feel pressured, stressful, and notÂ joyful about going there. The student may also rebel , leading to them acting bad around the students and making the activity simply unpleasant.\n \n Lastly , this school activities makes it feel like an extra hour of school. We already have enough homework and stress coming at us, so why should we get more? I get that the school is trying to make us be productive and help our school in a fun way with our friends , but whats the fun if we are getting forced to do them, also when students are getting forced to do an school activity it makes students feel like they have to do an extra class that doesn't even help our grades , nor does it count as a grade.\n \n In conclusion, this are some of the reasons I disagree with the principals decisions. I hope this could change your and the principals mind and take in considerate on students opinions as well.\n \n Students should choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and not be forced to.

        "Seven hours per day for five days a week and some students have activities to do after school, along with that students have mountain high piles of homework nightly. Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.\n \n Seven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule. Other students may be struggling with an aspect of school and they go to tutoring for that reason. Adding an extracurricular could interfere with the help they need to succeed.\n \n Starting from age seven students are asked to do homework. When students are seven and in 1st grade they may not have a large amount of homework; however, when students are in high school the quantity will only grow. While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.\n \n Plenty of studies have shown that this past generation of students have the the largest amount of stress scientist have seen in years. Whether that stress comes from bullying, home life, school work, mental health, or high expectations, stress is unsettling high in students of all ages. Middle school student worry about the transition to high school, and high schoolÂ studentsÂ worry about their transition to college.

        "How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all of the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.\n \n In the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an extremely big interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyways, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.\n \n With the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many different opportunitiesÂ that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremelyÂ helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievementÂ for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside of the school as well.\n \n In the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all of the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activitiesÂ that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.\n \n In conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activitiesÂ such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activitites may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",

After school activities don't only have to be sports though, there's a variety of options, like music, strategy activities, or art.

As a student you might not know what to do for a living, but extracurricular activities can allow a student to find a hobby and give them a gist of what they might want to study later on. Finally, these after school activities allow students to practice skills that will help them throughout their life, like strategy, athleticism, and socialization.\n \n Overall, I think that having a rule that makes all students participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea because it keeps students active and participating in something, it allows you to socialize with ones you don't know and ones you do, it also gives you more options for a hobby, maybe you could find something that you are interested in to study later in life, it can give you a chance to find something new that you didn't know you liked before, and finally, it practices important skills that will help you throughout your entire life.

One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking.\n \n In so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be. This is why i love doing extracurricular activities! Show what you can do and do it. I believe in you!",

        "I disagree with the decisionÂ that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.\n \n Here are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.\n \n However there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricularÂ activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.\n \n I think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.\n \n In conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.",

        "I agree with the principals decision that all students should participate in atleastÂ one extracurricular activity, it helps students learn new things, make new friends, and have a break from the daily stresses of school. In todaysÂ tough and rigorous education system, students of all ages come home stressed, worried, tired, and upset. The goal is not just to learn anymore but to succeed and ace every single exam. I believe that if everyone had a relaxing and enjoyable activity with no grades or stress, school would become a much more enjoyable place for students, and become a healthier environment for students to successfully thrive in.\n \n This decision will help in four aspects of the students health; academically, physically, socially, and mentally. Academically, like mentioned in the previous paragraph, is greatly improved. Students need a break from the constant testing and late night studying and hours of homework. Personally I know many, many students who are up late at night and up early in the morning, cramming for their many school projects. An activity for them once a week would greatly reduce their sky high stress levels and lead to a better education. For example, I personally know that when I'm extremely confused or worried with my school work, all it takes is ten minutes outside and I feel a lot more calmed down and ready to focus and tackle my homework. I strongly believe that adding this program will rise so many students grades up by a lot.\n \n The next aspect is how this is physically beneficial. Every day students are cooped up in their classrooms, in their uncomfortable chairs, straining their eyes. Once middle school begins you can say goodbye to recess, and when high school starts you begin ninety minute classes. The sitting around for hours on end just gets worse and worse as the workload increases. Those who choose to play sports can make sure to get in their healthy amount of excersize and stay fit and active. Those who do an art class or take pictures for the yearbook are still up, moving and stretching, this is crucial to a growing students health after sitting for seven hours. Students deserve the opportunity to get up and move around because many are sore and tight after sitting for so long. It may not be easy to realize but just giving them that hour of movement after school is so, so beneficial to their health.\n \n The last two aspects are mentally and socially. Mentally has been touched on already, the brain needs a new activity, a break from the constant learning, to explore new paths and try new things. Expand the boundaries of you mind in ways you don't in school. However another aspect of this is emotion. Happier, more social students can usually perform better because they have things to look forward to after school that keeps them positive throughout the day. Some students who are having trouble making friends, or are new to the area can now find a whole group of people to spend time with, and better yet all these people have the same interests as them. This can really benefit some lonely students. It can really make the difference for their grades too, when they become a lot more outgoing. I remember one year, a new girl moved to our school and was rather lonely, she joined the musical, got the lead, and by the end of the year had lots of supportive friends and fellow theatre enthusiasts cheering her on. It was great to see how being a part of something really helps you expand your friend groups and meet people you would have never spoken to if not for the activity. It goes to show how positivity and a better outlook help keep up your energy to really engage with your classes and teachers.\n \n In conclusion, it is crucial for a students proper development and overall educational experience that they are given a break from the demanding tasks of school to enjoy themselves. To give themselves some time to relax, and simply do what they enjoy while meeting new people, learning new things, becoming healthier, becoming happier, and more prepared to conquer the next day of school. I truly believe this decision will greatly benefit the overall health and well-being of all students.",

        "Imagine, one day you're at school, and you hear over the loudspeaker that all students in the building must report immediately to the Lecture Hall, for some new \"\"adjustments\"\". Although you are a bit surprised by this sudden announcement, you walk towards the Lecture Hall at a leisurely pace (as if you were anticipating something like this to happen). Once you're there, you sit in a chair and wait for all the other students to come rushing in like a stampede of wildebeests. After everything settles down, the principal picks up a mic from a lectern on the stage and starts a speech. In this speech, he talks about how the after schoolÂ clubs are experiencing a steep decline in the number of students that attend them. He presents the crowd with a solution to this problem, a solution that is greeted with some harsh criticism from the majority of the student body. He says that, in order to keep the after schoolÂ program alive, all students will be forced to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, and that all students who chose to not follow this new rule will be expelled. Bewildered by this, you yell out in protest of this new policy, but to no avail. For the principal has already left the stage, and now you have to be a part of one of those worthless, unnecessary, and boring after schoolÂ clubs. As you can see, it is detrimental, to both the students and the school as a whole,Â to force all of the students in a school into participation in an after schoolÂ activity. Due to a plethora of factors along with the one I just described, I wholeheartedly disagree with my principal on forcing every student in the school to attend an after schoolÂ club. If you don't believe me already(in regards with this issue at my school), then hopefully the following paragraphs will succeed in persuading you.\n \n First of all, making it mandatory for all students in a school to attend at leastÂ one club takes away some of their freedom with how they experience their lives. By this, I mean that, by forcing students to go to an after schoolÂ club, you are limiting their options for what they can do after school is over. This is due to the simple fact that, once the student chooses their club(s), the time that that club occupies can't really be used for anything else and takes up a big chunk of the student's schedule. To give context, allow me to give you an example. Lets say that Generic_Name, a seventh grader, decided to take\n \n Quiz Bowl as his extracurricular activity. Immediately all regular activities from 2:30- 5:30 are canceled. In addition to this, he now has to go to some weekend meetings, resulting in him not have time to hang out with his friends anymore, study for school, do all of his homework, or go to the gym. Instead, he now has to guess answers to random questions about the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and wait till about 6:00 PM to get picked up by his bus, and then dropped off at home at almost 7:00 PM, completely exhausted and burned out. As, you can hopefully see, having to do even just one after school activity can take a lot time out of a students life, and in extension a lot of freedom with their life.\n \n Second of all, with this new policy, transportation can become an incredibly detrimental issue for students that suddenly have to take at leastÂ one extracurricular activity. This is because there will always be some students in a school who can't take the bus and have parents that work too far away to be able to pick them up, making it nearly impossible for those students to get home safely, or on time. In addition to this, transportation can be a huge issue in the fact that, with\n \n ALL\n \n students having to take an after schoolÂ activity, on any given day, buses could have to leave behind some students because of a shortage of seats, leaving those who were left behind with no options to get back home. For example, let's say that all the students decide to participate in an extracurricular activity on the same day. With all of those students, it would be near impossible for them all to get a bus rideÂ home. And because of all the parents that have to work during the time that those students would get picked up, the school would be left with a large crowd of students that have no way of getting home on time.\n \n Finally, this policy will probably create a harmful school environment. By this, I mean that it would result in a multitude of considerably hard-to-deal-with problems. Such problems would be: an unmotivated student body, protesting from parents, and an unproductive student body. The lower school morale may stem from anger in students at the principal, and teachers that are exhausted from being overworked due to the fact that most of them will have to host at leastÂ one after schoolÂ club; the parents might complain due to the fact that they won't be able to interact with their children as much, and because they might not like the discontent in their children; and unproductivity would be caused by students burning out from the extra time that they have to spend in school. In addition to all of these problems, students might also try to not participate in extracurricular activitiesÂ resulting in extreme punishments(i. e expulsion).\n \n To wrap it all up, there are a lot of reasons as to why my principal's new policy on extracurricularÂ activities isn't very great. It limits a students freedom, it can't really function due to the lack of transportation that is needed for all of the students, and it creates a bad school environment. For these reasons, I think that the principal shouldn't have made this policy.",

I think it will help kids get the understanding about sport and working on something, when they get older so what they meant to do and help people. my decision is that the principal should do that more because it will help kids be more better at thing like that so if they ever wanna play sport or anything they know that you have to participate in everything we do.\n \n Activity are fun thing thing to do with people and at school cause it enoyable and fun to do, i really think the principal should do that at every school and the principal is right all kids can participate in sport or work is because it keep kids busy and it have kids doing some extra instead of all the kids sitting in the house or just doing nothing and i think it the right think to do is becuase they can get to express more thing in the world and kids can see more other just not doing nun but being in the house sleep and it will make kids understand life more.

Making friends can be really hard for some people while for others it can be the easiest thing to do. Joining a club can help with making a friend because the people in the club have the same interests as you.

Yes, we all like binge watching our favorite shows, but it has to come to an end at some point in the day for us to be able to do our work and hang out with friends.

        "Can a activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.\n \n If more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just haveÂ a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.\n \n Doing any activity outside school also work makes people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind theirÂ goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discoverÂ and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outsideÂ the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physicallyÂ and it makes he or she have a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence it's family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influence other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the you or them have changed so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.\n \n Like alwaysÂ everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most commonÂ problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.Â Â",

        "It's the last play of the State Championship you have the ball at midfield your going as fast as you can go but you know your not fast enough to out maneuver the defender insight but, you sidestep and the defender goes flying past and you walk into the end zoneÂ untouched to win the game. You look up into the stands and you see your entire town chanting your name then, you look back down to the sideline and you see your team, your brothers coming towards you and they lift you up on their shoulders and in that moment you feel like your the king of the world. This is what goes through your head as you hear your principal inform the whole school that everyone has to participate in a extracurricular activity. IÂ agree that everyone should have to participate in a activity because there are so many good things that can come from them. Here are some reasons I suggestÂ that it is vital for someone to participateÂ in a extracurricular activity.\n \n Leadership is one of the most used traits people use it is vary important in your everyday life and in general it's a good character trait to have. First things first you need leadership skills in school let's say your put into a group with some people for a group project. Subsequently,Â no one is motivated to do any work so you take the reins and you jump right in and you start assigning people objectives to meet. With your leadership skills your group gets an A+ for the project all because you took charge. Another reason leadership is important is in sports if you play a position like me goalie, you always have to be controlling the defense or say your the quarterback of the football team you have to be able to communicate with the team and tell them the plays and control the offense. Most important of them all is when your an adult and you have to mange a small group of workers, you assign a worker project to complete by next week. That worker doesn't turn the project in on time and your boss gets mad at you because you were supposed to be managing it and making sure it is done on time.\n \n Having friends in Middle School and High School are important for every kid, teen, and even adults. New kids struggle every day tryingÂ to make friends with others and people have already been friends for 3 year now. A great way for people to make friends with people is through extracurricular activities. Because, the new person and the people in the club or sport share the same interests they have a way to talk to each other. When I first moved to Generic_School I had no clue who any of these people were but, when football season came around and I signed up my team became my second family I knew them like brothers and we stayed together for years.\n \n Some parents won't be happy with the change to their kids schedule but, that is expected when you are making kids do stuff that is new to them. But, when you look at major cities like New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan extracurricular actives are changing their cities for the better. It's keeping the kids off the streets and they are less likely to have been roped into gang related activities. Even kids mortality rate has dropped rapidly since cities have implementedÂ rules that make kids join sports teams or clubs. That shows that making kids do extracurricular activates has helped kids in bad areas stay safe and have a higher chance of making something of their lives.\n \n In this passage I have presented you with some reasons I agree that is vital for schools to implement the rule that all students have to participate in extracurricular activities. This rule will forever change schools in the up and coming years for the better. I suggestÂ that all schools should have this rule implemented for safety and to help their kids build social skills, leadership skills for them to use in their futures. This rule would show kids competitive environments because that's what it is like in the real world.Â  Â Â Â Â",

        "Extracurricular activities, which are activities you can participate in and enjoy the things you would want to do after school such as sports, writing, and any after school activities your school can offer for the students. You're able to choose when and which after school activities you want to go too, but should every student be obligated to participate in extracurricular activities. Why students shouldn't be obligated to take part of an extracurricular activity. After school activities are something you should enjoy and not something to be forced to do and here's why. Some students might have a lot of stuff going on while they aren't at school. Students might also not like participating in after school activities due to no interest in the activities. Possibly students could see extracurricular activities as more stressful than fun.\n \n A students' time after school could be very valuable and partaking in after school activities could always be very time consuming. Sure after school activities could be an hour or two but what if a student has other important things to do out of school. A student could be participating into other activities like sports and might not have time to do homework or study and on top of that being obligated to stay after school. A student might also have pets or siblings to take care of, which would be more important than an after school activity. An obligated extracurricular activity would just be time consuming and might not fit into a students' schedule. The school should understand that students also need time at home because seven hours of learning in school is as already as hard as it is, and then having to go to an after school activity wouldÂ just makeÂ the situation even worse.\n \n There could also be no after school activities a student might have interest in. Some students might have interests that the after school activities doesn't offer them. Even if it's just working on the school year book, an after school activity must be something a student should enjoy after school, not just being forced to do extra work. Just like anything you would want to do, you would participate and join it because you wanted to, and not because of obligation or force too. Just forcing a student to stay after school for something they don't want to do would just make the student dislike school even more. Students should enjoy doing what they want after school which might not even be an extracurricular activity.\n \n Stress would also partake in students having to be obligated to stay after school for extracurricular activities. After a long day at school students would just want to head home and relax from school. Worrying about having to stay after would just cause the student to be more stressed. What if a student didn't have a ride to get back home from after school activities or they were scared of being at school longer, then what would they do in that situation? In case these situations happen what should the solution be? Well since these issues could happen from obligation of partaking in an extracurricular activity, then the only solution should be that after school activities should not be obligated and only stay optional for the better.\n \n Why students shouldn't be forced to participate after school activities. There are many reasons why a student shouldn't be obligated to participate in after school activities and why it should stay optional. Staying after school could stress a student out due to obligation of staying at school for an hour or two more. A student can have other things they do outside of school that after school activitiesÂ can take time away from it. A student might even dislike the activities at the school and would not enjoy their time of staying after school which is the opposite of what after school activities are about. Staying after school is something that'sÂ optional and something you can enjoy doing. All concluded which is the reason why school activities shouldn't be a must.",

        'A few weeks ago, a priest said to me, ""Go the second mile."" That sentence really hit me. I asked myself if I was giving back to the world as much as the world gave me. I\'m sure you know that going the second mile means don\'t do the minimum, go above and beyond. I thought adding this short story would be important because sometimes kids just wanna do the minimum of going to school and then going home. I think that every kid should do at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you succeed with your academic life, do exercise, and have fun.\n \n First, I think that extracurricular activities can help you succeed with your academic life. For example, you can go to a math club if that is what you need help with. This demonstrates that doing extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject. For instance, you can get help from your teacher or coach on a subject that they might know more than you about. This shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to get more help on subjects you might need extra help with. Also, going to an extra class or activity can help you minimize your laziness by having not just to go there, but to complete the work you are given there too. My examples are all evidence of why extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject.\n \n Second, extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise. For example, you can join a basketball team or soccer team. Joining any sports team would help you do exercise by playing with your teammates and practicing. For instance, you can join a math club, memory club, or any other type of academic club that can help you think and answer questions. This demonstrates that joining and academic club can help you exercise your brain by thinking and answering questions. Another way extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise is by doing community service for your teachers. Doing community service like cleaning tables or organizing the library is a way to do exercise because you are constantly moving your arms and legs. In this paragraph I showed you how extracurricular activities can help you work your muscles and exercise your brain.\n \n Finally, extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun. For example, you can hang out with your friends. Hanging out with your friends and doing an activity together can not only strengthen your friendship but also can be an excellent way to have fun. For instance, going to a basketball club or a club you really like can be an amazing way to have fun. This is because you get to do an activity that you love not just by your self, but with other people that love it too. Another piece of evidence that shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun is by meeting new people and making friends. Meeting new people and making friends is always fun if you let it be, so it demonstrates that extracurricular activities are a really good way to have fun. Every piece of evidence I wrote here are excellent examples of why extracurricular activities can bring you joy and happiness.\n \n In conclusion, I think that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you do better on a subject, help you work your muscles and brain, and bring you joy and happiness. Go try an extracurricular activity with your friends. In case you don\'t like the activities in your school, ask to make a new one. They are always worth the trouble. A very wise religious leader once told me, ""Go the second mile."" I found those words to be the greatest I have ever been told.',

        "Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.\n \n As we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This mayÂ also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.\n \n Our parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whetherÂ it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lotÂ ofÂ money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.\n \n When it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.\n \n Extracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and canÂ take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.",

        "Extracurricular Activities are like music; some people like it, others do not. The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree, for the students may be shy, busy, or have money problems at home.\n \n To begin with, students could be shy. Being shy and put on the spot in front of a group could build anxietyÂ or stress. If they work better alone, being apart of any extracurricular activity means that you work with other kids.\n \n The students may not be athletic, or may not like the clubs the school offers.\n \n For instance, if a student is shy and he or she has to work with a group and express ideas, or if they join a team and have to do certain tricks, their anxiety and stress may increase.\n \n Also, children can be busy, they have a life outside of school just like everyone else.\n \n They might have to take care of others.\n \n When taking care of others its hard to go to a club or sport after school, because when you get home your tired from your long day .\n \n That is not fare to the students because when they get home they will be tired, have to do homework, and take care of somebody.\n \n The kids may have appointments, like doctors appointments dentist appointments, or therapy appointments.\n \n Some appointments can be every night, depending on the circumstances but no oneÂ should miss their appointment.\n \n For example, a students has therapy appointments three times a week with his therapist he should not have to miss his appointments for any club or sport.\n \n In addition, kids may have money problems. They might not have a car, or money to get transportation. They probably do not walk home because by the time for them to leave it would be dark and their parents do not want them to walk home.\n \n If they join a club they might have to buy a shirt, or if they join a team they might not have money for uniforms.\n \n Specifically, if a student does not have transportation at home, and does not have money for other transportation, then he would not be able to go.\n \n In conclusion, I do not think that having an extracurricular activity is needed for all students. I think this unfair, granted that they can build social skills, and spend less time on electronic devices.\n \n In my opinion they shouldÂ notÂ be forced to join a extracurricular activity. I think they should encourage it but not force it.",

        "Have you wanted a to hit a soccer ball and make a goal or win a debate tournamentÂ at your school.Â Students who want to try-out sports or debate find an extracurricular at their school. Having at least a extracurricular is a good idea to have when you are looking for something new at your school or club. Students who are engaged with the extracurricular are going to more focus on other topics. Extracurricular is a great way to keep students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends.\n \n Having a extracurricular helps keep students active. Most students are on their phone all the time,so by having students participate in a extracurricular prevents them on their phone. I have done an extracurricular in my school, that has help forget about my phone and instead focus on more important on my softball team. Keeping students active on extracurricular helps them focus on the extracurricular they are doing. There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active.\n \n An extracurricular has different options to tryout. Trying out a extracurricular can be hard to choose. When you are trying out extracurricular you should find talents or skills that you are good at to find the perfect extracurricular. When I had to find a extracurricular I to choose activities that I am good at, or extracurricular that is joy able. Extracurricular is fun to explore out what kind of activities you are good and most joy able.\n \n Socializing with your friends is fun when you can hang out with your friends in a extracurricular. Socializing with your friends can be extracurricular, for example like a girl or boy's club or a book club can be ways of an extracurricular.

Keeping students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends are different ways of enjoying extracurricular and engaging students to themselves the activity that their are really interest into.

        "Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? Probably so, it'll be beneficial to them.\n \n I think that all students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because it'll give them a new experience, they'll meet new people, and depending on the activity, it can help them develop their future.\n \n An after school activity can give you a new experience, but how? Sometimes, you might not know exactly what you like, so an extracurricular activity could help you learn more about yourself. I mean, even if you dont like it you'll know not to do it again, right? Besides learning more about yourself, trying something new can just be good for you, especially if what you're doing is a sport or something that'll develop your future. Well, maybe your friends might want to brag to others that they were on the football team when they graduate. A sport or even an art activity could help you if you're applying to a job, but it would also give you, in a way, work experience, especially if you're applying to a job that is related to that activity when you're older. Even if you might not like the activity, it will be beneficial to you at some point.\n \n Meeting new people can benefit students. Sometimes, you might not have many friends who have the same hobbies, but when you're joining an activity, especially if it's something that you like, there's bound to be people that have the same hobbies. Who knows, maybe you might find a really good friend there. Meeting new people can make connections, connections are good to have when you're older and you might have a specific job to do. Maybe you might just need something and you remember your friend from that activity became a pretty great manager of a popular company. Usually, when you're joining an extracurricular activity, there's going to be people who are older than you and they have more experience in the activity you might've joined, it would be helpful to you to learn what they have been taught. It's good to learn from other perspectives, don't you think? Making new friends and meeting new people could ease stress with coming up tests, they'll help you relax a little more.\n \n Well, what if students don't want to participate? It can be difficult for a student to participate if something is happening outside of their school life. Sometimes, students might not be able to participate because of family, work, money, or time. There's a point in time where they will have to make exceptions. Besides that, usually it seems like the students around here might not do much outside of school, so they'll be kept a little busy with an activity.\n \n My final thought is that, of course, students should participate because they'll meet new friends, maybe even learn some new skills, and develop themselves and their future. So, go ahead and join an activity, you could really learn from it!",

        "Imagine going home and doing nothing but work, work, and more work. Being cooped up in the house and the only thing you could do is homework for hours. I think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. They will have the chance to do something that makes them happy. Something that will let their brain take a break from working so hard during school.\n \n Students will be able to make new friends and meet new people. Before I came to middle school I only knew the people from my elementary school and that was it. Until I joined chorus, I made friends with people that enjoyed music as much as I did. It was so much fun to be around new people and to make new friends. Even though we would have to stay after school to practice for up coming concerts it was still worth it. It gave me something to do after school and I could let my brain take a break from comprehending all the learning tactics that I have come across in school. I got the opportunity to do the one thing that makes me happy almost everyday. If students participate in an extracurricular activity it will give them a chance to open up to new people that may stay with them for a long time in their life.\n \n Students will have something fun to do after school. They would get to enjoy something fun that they may want to continue in their future. It gives them a chance to relax and enjoy the things they love to do outside of school. It will be a more enjoyable experience when they are doing something that really makes them happy. One of my friends loves to play sports and it makes her really happy. She was not worried about homework or getting something done right when she got home. Instead she got the chance to let her mind rest from all the learning and power on the part of her brain that helps her enjoy the sport that she loved. Students will have a better time concentrating on there homework after they have had time to relax by doing extracurricular activities.\n \n Students will have the opportunityÂ to learn something new whether it is a new instrument or a new sport. Every day in school you learn new things in all subjects but it is all surrounded around test and quizzes. But when a student decides to take an extracurricular activity they can learn something that will make them much happier and that does not involve test or quizzes. When I was in fourth grade I decided to start playing the violin. I understood that it was a big responsibility taking on something outside of school but it was worth it. I have always loved playing the violinÂ and I continue to play it now. Also I had to stay after school multiple times to practice with everyone in the orchestra. I learned how to make my brain stronger by doing something that was at a different level of difficulty in a different way.\n \n In conclusion, I think that student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. Students might discover something new about themselves that they did not know before they decided to take and extracurricular activity. Students should not have to work so much and not have any time to themselves. Everyone needs time to relax and do the things they love. By relaxing they give their brain a break to recharge and get ready for all the work that will come in the future.",

        "Student's usual school day lasts about 6-8 hours. After school, students usually like to kick back and relax. Some student's might actually have things to do after-school, like sports or schoolwork. However, if they're principal takes that privilegeÂ away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.\n \n Students also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.\n \n Being required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work. Late assignments will increase, which will bring down student's grades very quickly. More missingÂ work will increase, too, which will bring their grade down even more. Adding more after-school activities, whether it's academicÂ or not, will cause studentsÂ unnecessary stress.\n \n So whats the issue? After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.",

Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills, build life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. Yes, i think that all students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\n \n Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills. Many people have various forms of social anxiety or they may just be naturally shy, but bonding over something you both enjoy doing can build true friendships that can last a lifetime. For example, i'm a competitive dancer, and i remember when i first stared dancing, i was shy and didnt like to do anything that was out of my comfort zone. Now i'veÂ been dancing for almost 9 years and my favorite people are my friends at my dance studio. While i started off shy and scared to talk to new people, i have become best friends with the people i was shy around, i believe if everyone does a club or activity, everyone would have amazing friendships like mine.\n \n Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social skills and a great way to build life skills too. soccer is a sport that builds control, endurance, and good sportsmanship, while a club like Beta club, is a club that builds leadership skills and gives you the opportunity to help those around you. There is something different with every activity, if you try and find a club or activity that helps to build the skills you are interested in or skills you would like build, then you might just end up having a good time and it might just be something you'll want to do as a profession.\n \n Clubs and Activities are a great way to build social skills, build life skills,and also a great way to enhance your future. Clubs and activities will build skills you will use for the rest of your life. If you do a academic club, you might win first place in a really big category, that win will look really good on your college application. If you do a sport, college scouts might be at your game and they might recognize you and give you a free scholarship to a college and maybe that college will be one you really wanted to go to. Clubs and activities can benefit your future in so many more ways then you might think.\n \n Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social and life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. when your principle asks you if your going to do an extracurricular activity, what will you say?",

        "Imagine you are at your high school graduation, your name gets called up and every one in your grade chants your name. You have came far for this opportunity to go to a top notch university. You would think that it was all of your teachers that helped you. But then you forget about your Math and Science Olympiad coaches, your basketball coach. I believe that schools need extracurricular activities. If my principal told made a rule that every one single one of the kids had to do a extracurricular activity, I would most likely sign up in at leastÂ two or three activities. The reasonsÂ why I think this are, You can learn Important life skills, you gain knowledge of things you didn't know before academically, and it can sometimes be fun.\n \n My first reason why you should have these activities were that you can learn a bunch of life skills that would very useful in the future. Like teamwork. Teamwork is a very important skill you need to learn. In the future when you get a job. You will need to work with your coworkers. Sometimes you know your coworker an other times you will get paired with someone you will not know. It is always very important to know how to work with other and communicate with them when necessary. My second example is that it teaches time management. When I was in Odessy of the Mind, I had little to know time to do my homework. So I would do my homework at school and not worry about it when I would get home. This is why so you can just chill in you home or do other priorities. Third and final example is Responsibility. Let's all be honest. We all learn responsibility when we were very young. I learned it before I started Preschool. I will give you an example on why responsibility is so important. You are playing football. You are the center. Your job is to snap the ball to the quarterback and block the big defensensive tackles and linebacker. If you don't do you are responsible for, then the quarterback will get tackled for a lose of yards, or he will get hurried to throw the ball and will throw a bad pass. This is why this skill is so important. You need to what your job is and how to do it.\n \n My second reason why you should have these activities is that you gain knowledge academically. When you go to a extracurricular activity to do with math or science, you will learn new things from an academical standpoint. Take math for an example. Let's say you are in 6th grade. You are talking an after school math advanced math class. Your teacher teaches you the Quadratic Formula. Look at you now, you are in 6th grade and you know how to do quadratics. Also, take science for an example. They teach you a ton of things, maybe you are in 7th grade and talking an extracurricular class of physics. Great job, now you know what a black hole is. Okay, my last example is that you are in student council, now you know how to stand up and talk to people and know how rules get passed. I could list hundreds of examples. But you can only do this if you have a positive mindset and be there only if you want to be there.\n \n My third and final reason is that you actually have a lot of fun. If you play a sport such as football and basketball, you get excited and have a ton of fun, Sometimes when in an extracurricular class, you have fun time learning new things that you are interested in learning. You can sometimes have a lot of fun and learn things academically to. You can reduce stress and anxiety, and it can exercise your brain. So from an entertainment standpoint. ExtracurricularÂ activities are really good.\n \n Well I believe that Extracurricular activities are very useful and great de to these three reasons, They teach you very important life skills, they teach you things from an academical standpoint, and the third and last reason was that they are really fun. Extracurricular activities are no classes that you have to get an A on. They are classes the you inquire knowledge out of. They are their to give you the knowledge that you need.",

It's good that kids go see they're family, also and kids are shy, they don't talk to people or they're not an outdoor person so they stay in the house and don't talk to no one. It would take up kids time if they want to go visit they family so I think kids should go visit they family if they don't see them that often and if they want to spend time with them. Most people worry about they family so they don't have time to go visit their family that much. Like my family that live far but not that far away from me i would go visit them and still be in things.\n \n Even tho kids are not an outdoor person or dont talk to that much people it they still dont have to do something they dont want to. Kids dont like staying after school for sports or anything only if its something fun and your helping out thats what kids like to do. Doing something could help but students shouldn't have to just do it if they dont want to and its theyre choice if they want to do it or not they dont have to get force to. A lot of kids just dont talk or nothing and they don't do nothing but talk to they friend or stay in the house and not do nothing. Most kids dont even have that much friends they could do or nothing so most kids dont do after school activitys.\n \n Kids just don't go outside or don't do something because they could get hurt or anything.

A lot of other kids are like teachers pet and do a lotÂ for teachers and even help out with a lot of teacher with a lotÂ of things . Kids are shy to even do extracurricular activity like help with year books , do sports or anything, most kids dont even see their family like they'er opposite to so kids dont do other activity or sports like that.

Students will be able to further improve their passion for the activity for example I found out about the D&D club at my school I went to one of their sessions and found out that I really had a passion for the game, I am still enjoying it to this day.\n \n Extracurricular activities build teamwork skills by making students work together to get a task done. For example when I was in D&D me and my group were in a forest when we saw a dead horse on the road two of my teammates were squinting to try and see the details, another one of my teammates was booking it to the horse to try to see what happened and I'm just standing their thinking to my self what are these nut jobsÂ doing then suddenly the teammate who was booking it got jumped by goblins I forced a fire boltÂ at one of the goblins, one of my other teammates is playing ping pong with his short bow, another one puts a knife in a goblins back, the paladin smashes his hammer on one of them, and the wizard throws acid at one we took them all out but the one who booked it died the end.\n \n What should have been taken away from this is that being part of an extra curricular activity helps make bonds and encourage teamwork skills, do you agree or disagree that studets must be in a extracurricular activity.",

        "Your principal has decided all students need to participate In at lest one extracurricular activity this year do you agree or disagree with this decision?\n \n I disagree, because a lot of students have siblingsÂ to take care of, some of there families won't let them do sports as well as there parents may work to late to come get them after a game or practice.\n \n Fist, a lot of students have to go home and take care of there brothers and sisters because their parents work to late so therefor how are you going to have time to play a sport who's going to take care of your little brother and sister? As a resultÂ of this you will not have time for the activityÂ your principal wants you to do. You have to go home and cook your family dinner because dads not around and mom works 12 hour shift so you know she's going to be to extremely tired and she's not going to want to cook so It's your job now you're going to feed mom and or your brother or sister. If you have to play sports how are you going to feed them?\n \n Second, you always take care of your sibling so how do think your mom is going to feel if you come home and say, \"\"mom I have to play a sport for school or I'm going to get In trouble.\"\" your moms going to be upset she does not want you to play sports because she does notÂ have the money nor time to take you and pick you up she wants to go home and sleep. She has to have your help with your brother or sister because she has no one else to help her and she does not have the money for a babysitter after school.\n \n Lastly, she works extremely to late to take you to a game or practice she just does not have the time, sports can be hard for people and beÂ overwhelm and that's a lot if you're going through family problems.

        "Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involvedÂ with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagreeÂ to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family.\n \n My first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worriedÂ about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved.\n \n There for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates.\n \n My final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no oneÂ wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did. ButÂ in the other hand thereÂ are kid that only see their parents once cause they come from work very late and go to work very early and you have to go to sleep cause there is school the next day. It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club.\n \n This is why i disagree that student shouldÂ have to participant in an activity. There are so many stuff that student might have to do out of school that makes them not be able to join a club,sport or any other activity that they offer in the school.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        'Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn\'t have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name\'s alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, ""Are you on your way to football practice?"" ""Unfortunately,"" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn\'t bad at football, he just didn\'t enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn\'t because too many people who didn\'t want to participate signed up. ""How\'s the student council?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,"" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn\'t have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn\'t enjoy it as much because those who didn\'t want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn\'t have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren\'t interesting to them.Â I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.\n \n The first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after schoolÂ activities.\n \n Another reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they\'re being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won\'t be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn\'t interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren\'t provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don\'t wish to participate.\n \n In addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don\'t want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you\'re on a team, whether it\'s a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn\'t putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who\'s not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they\'re interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyableÂ if a student doesn\'t participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.\n \n Generic_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team\'s effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. ""Guess what?"" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. ""What?"" Generic_Name replied curiously. ""I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!"" ""Congratulations, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, ""See you later, Generic_Name."" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn\'t have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team\'s effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.',

        "How many times have you stepped out of your comfort zone? Maybe once or twice? People always hold back in life from doing something they have wanted to do. Maybe they are scared or fear of being judged. They don't take opportunities when they have it and might regret it later. Having to do another extracurricular activity could open so many doors, for example, meeting new friends, trying something new, and maybe even finding something you're really good at.\n \n You know when you meet a new friend, you're so excited and can't wait for all the fun things you guys will do together! If you did an extracurricular you could have so many of these moments. Making new friends expands your friend group. You can meet people that you probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been pushed to stretch your horizons. And all these people can introduce you to new things that they are interested in like their favorite movie, books, or even their own friends. You could do the same. At this point you might even have double the friends you had before you even did this extracurricular, wouldn't that be fun! Making new friends is just one of the many aspects of trying something new!\n \n For most people their is always that one thing they want to try but never do. Maybe chorus, art, robotics, etc. When you do this extracurricular you finally get the chance to do that one thing you've always had in the back of your mind. Say you tried this new thing, you put in your all in it, and you didn't like it or you weren't good at it. That's OK! Now you know that you tried it. You have no regrets. And you're probably going to have fun along the way even if it didn't end up being your passion. Doing this extracurricular could get you to the activity you always wanted to do even if it's not your life's calling.\n \n My dad always says, \"\"Don't knock it till you try it.\"\". Which basically means don't say you don't like it till you have given it a shot. This applies to so many things like sports, food the list goes on. This activity that you try could be what your really talented at. Maybe not given the opportunity you have never tried it. That would be so sad, getting a talent and you don't even know that you have it. That would just be a waste! If you get an opportunity like this it could lead to many things and even find what you were meant to do.\n \n Trying something new, making friends, and discovering what you're really good at is just a few of the possibilities if you do an extracurricular. Trying something different could open your world, and make you see things in a different light that maybe you looked down on before. You could finally find that one interest that you've been waiting for. And maybe that you're really good at too! Having to do another extracurricular helps you find friends and broadens your friend group! I really think that adding an extracurricular will benefit teens in many ways and really make them branch out which they probably weren't doing in the first place.Â",

        '"" What are you going to choose?"" That is the sound of a student at a school which requires them to do an extra- curricular activity. Students enrolled at this school must do some sort of extra curricular activity, whether it is a sport, a spot on the yearbook club, or serving on the student council. I agree with the requirement of an extra curricular activity because it can help you find people with the same interests and lead you to new interests, it can help create a better community environment and it will help all the students mature and succeed in the future.\n \n Participating in an after school activity can lead you to people that have the same interests and can lead you to other interests. i have been playing lacrosse for about 8 years now and as I\'ve played throughout the years, I have discovered many different hobbies through my teammates such as cheer leading, track and field and rock climbing. I\'ve also been able to make friends because I\'m on a different team every season. I have made about 3 lifetime friends in lacrosse. I think this can happen with school lead activities. I think by being part of an after school activity, you can make lifelong friends, find people with the same interests and discover new hobbies.\n \n Doing an after school activity can help create a better community environment. this kind of relate back to the previous statement about making friends.\n \n by making friends, you can create less bullying. there is this saying, ""strength in numbers"", and I truly think this would happen with an after school activity requirement rule. By installing an activity requirement, you would help build a bully-free community.\n \n Lastly, an after school activity would help students mature and prepare themÂ for the future. I babysit a little boy with downs-syndrome and i often take him to the park. When we leave, you tell he is a little bit more mature from when we first arrived. this is because hen has played with older kids and have copied their actions. I believe this goes with all kids. if we had an after school activity program and we put all the grades together, it would help the younger one mature but also the older kids could teach them how to do things that they will need to know in the real world.\n \n I think everyone should be involved in some sort of group, whether it be school related or not. Maturing kids, better community environments and finding new friends can all happen with a required after school activity program.',

        'Do you think students will have time to do at lest one extracurricular activity after reading this? Doing an extracurricular activity might not always bring good things to students. This can affect students in a lot of ways with other things they do after school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time, they can have other activities after school, and students can get stressed and tired.\n \n To begin with, one reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time. Students will not have time to do their homework after school. They might not have time to finish a project they been signed or to study for a test. Students will not have time to go out and hang out with their friends or spend time with their families. For example, students will not have time to eat dinner with their families.\n \n Next, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might already do other activities after school. Students might already participate in after school sport but no play a school sport. If students are 15 years or older they can start working and some students might want a easy after school job. They probably want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school. For example, take dance classes or instrument classes.\n \n In addition, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can get stressed and tired. If students get stressed their grades can go down and their parents can get mad. Students can get tired and sleepy in class and teachers will keep on saying, ""keep your head up"" during class. It will be hard for students to keep up with their work in class for example, they will not finish on time.\n \n Finally, students will not have time to finish their homework or projects they have and no time to be will their families and friends. They will want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school like other classes. If students do get into a extracurricular activity they can get stressed or tired and their grades might go down. This are the three reasons why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity after school.',

This will teach students many skills that could benefit them in the future.\n \n First off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. For example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. Joining a sport discovered many things I didn't already know about myself. I learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. Therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.\n \n Next, Joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. This leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. For example, I joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my bestÂ friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into.

        "To most students, school is like a black hole that they would do anything not to fall into. Kids go to school and sit for seven hours, and then go home and do almost the same thing. It's not healthy for them and it makes them dread school even more. Students are constantly falling asleep throughout the day because they don't have anything to look forward to, and that makes them feel as if school isn't as important as it is. If they don't have any fun, then they won't try in school whatsoever. If students are doing extracurricular activities, they'll be way more active and less tired throughout the day. I think that students should be required to do an extracurricular activity because it will get them involved in their school, it will keep them active in many ways, and they will learn more about everything around them.\n \n First, Extracurricular activities will get students involved in their school. For example, they'll be representing their school. You're representing your school in any activity you pick, but you especially if you're playing a sport. Sports teams are like little families in the school, and the people playing on them love their teammates and love the place they're playing for. If all the kids are required to do an extracurricular, and get to choose to play a sport, they'll get to meet lifelong friends and be the face of their school. This can make students love school so much more than they used to. Next, they will also be just as involved in their school if they do an activity like yearbook. In yearbook, you're constantly learning about the kids in your school and all your surroundings. Most kids barely get to know half of the people in their grade, but if they're learning about the people around them, they can get to know almost everyone. Finally, it'll be a chance for them to make new friends. As I said, most students barely get to know everyone they go to school with, and a lot of times they're to shy to try to get to talk to new people. When they're put in a club or an after schoolÂ activity, they learn how to communicate with others. Clubs could help so many people make new friends.\n \n Secondly, it will keep students active in many ways. For instance, playing a sport would be very good for any and all students. Constantly moving and exercising would help them stay active and fit, which is good for everyone. Most of your years in school you are required to do physical education, but sometimes you're barely even moving during the class. Sports will keep kids much more active than any class could. Also, being involved in an activity like student council or yearbook would keep their brains running and being used. They would always be coming up with new ideas and working on them/figuring out how to pursue them. When most students go home, they shut off their minds and are barely using them, causing them to not be as prepared to use them the next day. If they have to stay after schoolÂ for student council or yearbook, they'll still be using their brain. Lastly, students will actively learn communication skills. Communicating is so important in your life and will forever help you. You can't be in a club or play on a sports team and never learn how to communicate, because of this they will actively be learning new communication skills.\n \n Finally, these activities can help students be more confident. First off, some students think that they are alone in this world and that they is no one else is like them. If students join clubs that interest them, it'll show them that they are not alone and that there are other people that are similar to them. Even if they aren't doing something they're familiarÂ with, there will be other kids that are also trying it for the first time. Second, clubs and groups teach them how to talk to people. As I have said, you can't be involved in a group or on a team and not communicate with them. If students are basically required to talk to other people during the activities, it'll boost their confidence and help them talk to new people on their own. Last but not least, these activities will show them that they are good at something. It is very common for young kids to think that they are horrible at everything, especially if school and learning isn't their strong suit. These clubs can show them that they do have skills and are good at something.\n \n In conclusion, I think that students should have something to look forward to in school and not want to do anything to be out of going. They shouldn't have to wake up in the morning and dread going to a place they should love. This is why extracurricular activities should absolutely be a requirement. They have so many benefits and there will be many good outcomes. If extracurricularÂ activities become a requirement, students will become more involved in their school and everything around them, they will stay active in multiple ways and constantly be fit, and these activities will help boost up their self confidence.",

      essay:
        'Whenever you get home, do you do your homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don\'t then you are either a very responsible kid, or you have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and the other half go home and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because it teaches the students responsibility, helps them with college later on, and they won\'t be on their phones all day.\n \n One reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach them to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while they are still in school, it will help them succeed in their later life as an adult.\n \n Another reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can help with finding a college later on in life. If you chose a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really help you in the future when you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are really good at a certain sport by the time of your sophomore year, you probably have a very high chance of making it on your school\'s team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if they think you are good enough for their school, they will probably offer you either a full-ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that they can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by ""earth gov"" asked adults which college they went to and if they were involved in an extracurricular activity during theirÂ high schoolÂ years. About 90% of adults said that they got into college due to a extracurricular they were involved in during high school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.\n \n On the other hand, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. They already have enough stress as it is, we don\'t need to add extra weight onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can help teens not spend the entire after school time on their phones. The article ""Are Phones Good for Teens"" writes, ""most of all teens have access to a smart phone, and once they are let out of school and get home, the average teen spends 5 to 76 hours on their phone instead of doing their homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities."" Another article titled ""Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College"" states that ""when kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat they are deeply involved in extracurricular activites like sports, working on their school\'s yearbook, or being on the student council of their school."" If the universe was filled with more kids like these then the world would have a larger population of successful young adults than it has right now.\n \n In conclusion all students should be obliged to be involved in extracurricular activities becuase it helps them learn how to be responsible in their future life, it can help student get into a good college and be successful in life, and it can keep students off of their phones all day. To save our earth, the first step is saving the future generation.',

        "Should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricularÂ activities. Yes because they provide information and fun for the students. Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity becauseÂ we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricularÂ activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.\n \n Extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.\n \n By taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.\n \n Being active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.\n \n Extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. Extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",

        "If you were told that you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, how would you feel? While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them. Schools shouldn't take away student's after school time, that time is the only time that they get to relax.\n \n Schools have a limited option of extracurricularÂ activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.\n \n A lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.\n \n After school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.\n \n With all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.",

        '""Get up and try something new,"" someone once said. Imagine if the local school had fun activities after school that got students minds off of all the stress in their lives. I agree with this statement because extra circulars can introduce new friendships and create fun while exploring hobbies.\n \n After school programs can provide new friends. Many people that join a club or school sport are just trying something that they haven\'t before and need some encouragement from a peer or someone to talk to. When I joined the school play last year it was a requirement to tryout. I was very nervous, but with the help of the rest of the cast I sang in front of a whole crowd and was cast a role. Sometimes there are students who are in the classes of others and may never talk to them, extra circulars are the perfect time to ask them questions and make them feel comfortable. In my History class there was a girl named Generic_Name, she was very shy but also very sweet. We rarely talked until we both joined the Best Buddies program and were partners for everything, we became very good friends and still talk to this day. Lastly, there is a chance to meet someone with similar interests as others. My mother met her best friend from the school basketball team when she was in junior high, they both loved basketball and continued to play together throughout high school. Extra curricular activities can bring together so many people and create new friendships.\n \n After school programs can bring so much excitement and joy into students lives by trying new hobbies. Extra circulars come in many forms such as; plays, art, sports, or even technology clubs. By joining a sports team the coaches provide fun activities while still exercising,Â and in a club like the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) the leaders teach life lessons and helpful skills. I am a NJHS leader and our goal is to plan meetings after school that others enjoy while being informed as well. In these programs there may be a hobby that people never knew they liked. My friend went to the field hockey interest meeting and learned all about the sport from real players, she had so much fun that she tried out for the high school team and made Varsity! The activities are also beneficial to more than one group of students. Some kids with disabilities stay after school waiting for a ride home from their parents, as a result programs were created for scholars to stay with them and help do entertaining projects. At many schools they have the ""iCan Bike"" club, a club also for kids with disabilities to learn how to ride a bike without training wheels, using help from student volunteers the club fund raisesÂ money for the Special Olympics. Extra curricular activities make trying new things fun and helpful.\n \n In conclusion, I agree that students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These programs can help others meet new people that are similar to them and create enjoyment with taking part in new hobbies that will provide happiness.',

It should only be a list of people who are actually willing to participate and follow directions, not just participate because they have to or are being forced to. Sports aren't meant for everyone or you might not just have the ability to do sports, if the students decide to not participate in sports or the other options it shouldn't be a big deal,some may not want to do an extra class. The principal's choice or option really shouldn't be a must. There should be an agreement with students about it and if some agree they should add extra options. not just sports, Work on the year book, Or serve on the Student Council. That is really only three activities and there might be more but not exciting or just not fun to do. That's why it wasn't mentioned and there is a lot of moving in those few options which includes excercising. So therefore I totally disagree with The Principal's opinion or option of making it a Must do. It can affect people's attendance. They could skip that class because Either they hate it, Maybe not their thing or choice, And not just skipping the class. They maybe just won't come to school at all when they have to do the activity they chose. And that's not what the principal is trying to prove or achieve. The Principal wants excercising and moving but students don't. and also aswell complaining. Students may whine a lot to their teacher saying stuff like I don't want to be here or disrespecting The Teacher who gladly decided to help out. So in my opinion I think it's just better to keep it the way it is right now and not add the option of must do sports or the other activities.",

        'Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all\n \n Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students and tremendously decreases the time that aÂ student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.\n \n Generic_School students should not have to regularly participate in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.\n \n Generic_School students should not have to consistently partake in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called ""Generic_Name\'s Work Zone"" or ""WWZ."" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name\'s Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be.Â That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.\n \n I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student\'s energy and can negatively impact a student\'s health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact.',

This will get them out of their houses. These children have to go and help their team with the extracurricular activity that they chose. It will also make them use their brains. It teaches them to think outside of the box and to make creations from a thought. Lastly, it can also help them manage their time wisely. If they have other activities that give work or are near the same time, this will help them by learning what is more important or what they care more about. Some students might struggle to find time to do these activities, but they can chose what and when their activities should be.\n \n Secondly, these activities will help kids make new and lasting friendships. Make them work with others. Because these are all run by the school you will have to meet new people regardless, so why not try to make a lasting impressionÂ to the people you work with. Have them go on group outings.

        "My principal, Mr. Generic_Name, has just announced that all students are required to participate in one activity around the school. I think that is is a great idea for Middle and Elementary school! But some of the students don't like the idea as much. I agree with my principal's decision to require at least one extracurricularÂ activity. Whether it's encouraging students to learn something new that they like, getting to know others and making friends, or to spark a new hobby/interest. Here are my reasons and elaboration as to why I think this.\n \n My first reason is that some of your time in Middle School should be spent doing something that you enjoy learning. The Loudoun Times have written about other schools doing the same change as what Mr. Generic_Name just announced. A writer for the Loudoun Times interviewed students at one school and 1 out of 5 students interviewed didn't like the idea at first, but when the interview happened again in the middle of the school year, that ratio changed to 4 out of 5.\n \n Another reason why at least one extra curricular activity is good, is that you get to know others and make friends! CBS reported on a camp that was held in the Summer for exactly one week, which had kids aged 11 to 14 from 10am to 7pm, with 23 kids total, and activities of hiking, four square, camping, and more. All of the students except one had reported making at least one friends that they, later on in the camp, gave contact information to. I know this isn't in a school setting, but this proves that students can be the same way when doing a fun activity that they signed up for. If you like Tennis for example, you can play with other people in Tennis that share the same interest.\n \n The last sentence brings me to my next reason, which is sparking a new hobby/interest. The University of Virginia had 20 8th graders choose something new to learn. The options were, Guitar, Tennis, and Basketball. 16 out of 20 8th graders liked what they chose. The next day, having all of the 20 8th graders either choose something new, or choose something different, 13 out of 20 choose the same option that they chose yesterday. One student when interviewed, said that he liked Guitar and hoped he could learn more about it in the future. That one student probably now has a new interest of Guitar as well as the other students who chose their activity for both of the two days. The people who chose the activity for only one day at least have an idea of what isn't for them.\n \n I have just told you my reasoning! My 3 reasons have now told you why I support Mr. Generic_Name's decision of requiring at least one extracurricularÂ activity. Making friends, getting to know other people, sparking a new interest, and having people choose something that they just want to see if it's for them. At least one of these reasons can help students when choosing their activity and make them feel better. Mr. Generic_Name clearly made the best choice for our school.",

        "Did you know schools in your area have decided all students must participate in at least one after school activity? Incredible news if you ask me. Being involved in extracurricular activitys has shown to have amazing results on young growing minds. They're good for your overall health, they improve your skill sets and have a helpful impact on schools.\n \n Firstly, Being required to do a type of interactive activitly are not only expressive and fun but improve you mental and physical health. For example when playing a sport you practice getting stronger, improving your active ability and are getting in shape. You gain muscle and strength throughout your body. Your running gets much cleaner and your breathing gets more controlled. When I was really serious about my dancing skills I noticed a huge build up of leg muscle. Through out the years I've gotten alot stronger in my core and arms. Mentaly being active can take your mind of off hard times in your life. If you had a bad day at school or haven't been feeling your best, being active can make you feel alot more calm and have less anxiety. It takes you to a safe place. Every child should have access to something like that and the fact that not all kids do needs to change. Personally when I get in a fight with my parents I like to go for a run outside or play vollyball with my friends. I always end up feeling happier. Sports can also allow students release any anger or upset feelings they have. Some kids struggle with mentle health issues and don't all have resources to help. Playing a sport or being active can allow you to get ride of the upset feelings in a healthy way that won't harm anyone. I notice this can be a way to cope. It's okay to be angry but it's not okay to take your anger out on others or cause harm. There's also many ways after school activties can improve your different skill sets, here's some examples in the following.\n \n Secondly, extracurricular activitys helps improve your different emotinal skills. You learn to be more dedicated. When you playa sport or apart of a club you're on a team and you need to be there for one another. When you miss a practice you're not only letting yourself down but you're letting your team down too. When someone misses a practice on my dance team it's hard for all of us. We have reblock dances or fill in peeple who arn't there. It's more work for us which is unfair. You also learn to be more motivated. You start to set goals for yourself and strive to achive those goals. It can work with your school and home life too. Motivation can also make you more confident and work harder to be successful. I used to struggle with feeling motivated but when I stared dancing I found a strive for working as hard as I can to get better. It can be stressful but it's worth it. Dedication is also a skill that is getting worked on. Being dedicatied is always doing your best no matter how easy something is. Dedication is found when you try your best and go above what is required. If your apart of a yearbook club you learn to stay dedicated to finish the book and make it look as good as it can. You don't give up when it gets too hard. Your school does alot for you and you should always give back to what you get in return.\n \n Lastly, participating in after school activities helps improve you school. When being apart of sports your school provides, that's a way of donating money. You have to pay for things when you're apart of a team ( outfits, games ect). When giving money to your school it helps pay for field trips, better lunches, classroom design and lots more. My old school was able to have amazing field trips because we saved money from donations. Some after school activites can include art clubs, design groups and student council. We could make groups that help clean up trash around the school, let kids get creative and have art work around the school and create new ways students can express themselves and help others. The student council could be in charge of these groups and ensure work was being done. Finally after school groups and activites can help teachers and staff. School's are very dirty and it's a lot of work for only a few staff memebers to have to clean. Cleaning clubs could be a great way students can give back to our school. We could clean the floors, windows and bathrooms. Competive sports teams are a way to get our schools name out there so people pick going to our school rather than any others. If we have good sports teams that win parents will notice that and could end up sending their kids to our school. I have many friends that have moved schools to have better luck in getting into collage through good sports teams at their schools.\n \n In conclusion, schools requiring all students to endore one after school activity not only shows they care but improves your health, adds to your skill sets and is very helpful for your school and making it a better place. Students may not be as joyful in the begging but will soon notice a huge postive change and outlook towards school everyday. What is your take on this topic ?",

        "Have you ever participated in an activity where you either loved or hated it? Well, believe it or not, I think that all extracurricular activities should be appreciated. Extracurricular activities are activities used to equip you with new skills that you may not have had before, not used to only have fun and learn nothing from it just because your parents forced you to do it. They are there for a reason, and should be taken advantage of. I agree with the decision of the principal for making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity for three reasons: it gives you the opportunity to learn a life lesson, it can improve your academic performance, and gives you a chance to make new friends.\n \n The opportunity given to you to learn a life lesson can be rare. To learn a life lesson means to realize that this world we live in, isn't fair nor perfect. There will be times where you wish certain things had happened to make life better for you, but that just simply can't happen. Participating in an extracurricular activity can create memories and meaningful experiences that you can't experience anywhere else. It can also help with being disciplined, and can give you something to live for. That is why I think that taking part in an extracurricular activity can be life-changing.\n \n The act of participating in an extracurricular activity can even improve your academic performance. Depending on the activity, it can motivate students to do better if a certain activity requires you to have good grades in school. Participation in these activities can relieve stress, and looks good on your resume for college applications. Experiences from the activity can be stored up in your brain to be used as background knowledge in the future. Those reasons tie into the fact that taking part in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory.\n \n A chance to make new friends is always exciting for everyone. Making new friends also means making new relationships with the people you care about. Having people that you care for, rather than having random strangers around you, doesn't give you a sense of loneliness. It brightens you up like the sunrise, when you see the first beam of light. Making new friends especially while participating in an extracurricular activity makes it more fun, and amusing. It gives you an electric shock of joy, making you excited to come back again the next time. That is why I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity would be beneficial.\n \n Many people say that students should have a choice whether or not they would like to participate in an extracurricular activity, but I believe that it should be more of the opposite. The opportunity to learn a life lesson, improve your academic performance, and make new friends are the three reasons why I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Therefore, when you meet a student that currently doesn't participate in an extracurricular activity, invite them to join you, or find an activity that you think they would enjoy. This would be a great opportunity for everyone because they would be able to relieve their stress, do something that they love to do, and would enjoy every second of the activity, spending time with the ones they care about the most. Overall, I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of all the benefits, and the giant footprint that it would leave on this planet.",

        "About 57% of schools students participate in extracurricular activities. This means that over half of every school has students that already participates in an activity. I disagree with this decision because some students do not have time after school, don't have the transportation afterwards, or not interested.\n \n With this added, where will they find the time for their home life?\n \n First, I disagree because some students have a job after school. Some students have to work that job to help support, so having this added would just add to their stressful life. Second, some students have to help their familiesÂ withÂ things such as chores, make dinner, etc. If they have to stay at school longer, some of those important things wouldn't get done. Third, as we get older we get more homework and harder tests, so it's up to us to keep up with it. After school is the time where the students get to study or do their homework, so when would they do it if they have to stay after school everyday?\n \n Not every student has transportation afterwards, so what do students do when no one can pick them up? First, parents are busy people and have jobs too. Some parents just can't leave work to get their child. Second, if they don't have a ride, they will have to wait with a teacher until someone can pick them up. Thats not fair to the teacher, but to the student too. Third, students would have to bug other busy parents to ask for a ride home. Their friends parents can't always take them home, so on those days how do they get home?\n \n Some students just aren't interested, so why make them do something they don't want to do? First, if they are not interested, they most likely wont be paying attention. If the students not even paying attention, whats the point of even having them there? Second, they would be distracting the people that want to be there. If a student isn't into what they're doing, they are most likely gonna move a lot, make noises, or talk to the people around them. Third, they most likely wont put any effort in what they are doing. No one wants to be around the kid that doesn't do their work, so whats the pointÂ in them coming if the aren't going to put in the effort?\n \n In conclusion, that's why I disagree with the decision.

        "I agree with this 100%. Choosing an Extracurricular Activity is very important. Let me tell you why\n \n Extracurricular Activities can help with Social Skills. For Example if I am suffering from depression it gives me the chance to do something that would take my mind away from the depression. Another reason would be if you have anxiety you can play or choose an activity that relaxes you and just lets you escape from all the anxiety around you. One major point is working better with other people. Extracurricular Activities can help you as a learner work better with others. For Example my Granddad is in the Construction business and when you have jobs like that and teaching and pretty much any job you have to know how to collaborate with other people. This brings me to my final point Extracurricular Activities can help your Social Skills.\n \n These Activities can help with Social Activity as well. Like for example it give people who might not have friends or the best of friends a chance to make new ones whether it is through Sports or another type of Club. Another reason is because it gives you the opportunity to get closer and create a bond with friends and maybe even family. Plus there are many different clubs to choose from. These activities can help you stay fit and healthy as well. It also gives you the opening to meet new teachers and coaches that you might be able to start a bond with.\n \n There are many different options to choose from. If you like sports you could play football or basketball or even soccer or baseball. If you like to test your brain power you can join chess or checkers club. And last but not least if you like to speak in front of people public speaking. This is one of my classes that I strongly encourage people to take to help with speaking in the workplace. Art is another option if you like being creative.\n \n So my conclusion is choosing an Extracurricular Activity is important especially in High School and College.",

They could be playing sports outside of school and can't play on the school team or do other activities outside of school.

They should also send an email about what time the student should get picked up.\n \n Some students may not want to do a sport because they might get bullied if they are not good enough for that team. Students may also feel bad about themselves if they make a bad play, pass, or shot. Students should have to tryout for sports and should report any bullying if they do not make the team.

Doing some type of sport or even working on the school news paper could be fun. It would be expecially good for parents.

The parents will also be able to just have more time to their selves.\n \n Also, this could be helpful to the children mentally and physically. Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television. These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites.

        "The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These extracurricular activities include sports, student council, work on the yearbook, and other activities. This will force students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. I disagree with this requirement, for it can be stressful, it forces the students who dislike these activities to participate, and it takes away time for their other responsibilities.\n \n First, students might find extracurricular activities stressful. Students who dislike having to work with others are forced into an uncomfortable situation when they are forced to participate in extracurricular activities along with other students. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and some students may not be able to because they have responsibilities at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of homework and other responsibilities at home.\n \n Then, their grades may drop. If a student is required to leave class for their extracurricular activity while doing something important in class like notes then their grade may drop because they missed that work. Students may have work for an extracurricular activity and that work may pile up with work from their other classes. For example, My friend Generic_Name does student council and we were taking notes in class when they made an announcement for all student council members to meet in the library and Generic_Name ended up missing all of the notes for the test the next day.\n \n Also, students may have other responsibilities at home. Students my have responsibilities at home like walking their dog, cleaning the dishes, doing laundry, and other responsibilities. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and that takes away the time for the responsibilities the have at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of my homework and other responsibilities at home.\n \n However, students may enjoy extracurricular activities. Students may choose to participate in extracurricular activities, for it can be a way to have fun, you get to spend time with friends, and it gives you a time away from all of the stressful school work. For example, I do not get to spend time with friends during class because we are working and extracurricular activities can be a way for me to see friends and have fun. That is why some students may choose to participate in these extracurricular activities.\n \n In conclusion, Students who are forced to participate in after school activities may lose time for school work, responsibilities, and personal time. When a student is forced into an activity that they dislike it they might slack off and that can distract other students who care about their activity from thier work. Students should have a choice of what they do during and after school because it can affect their attitude towards their school work. That is why I disagree with the principal's requirement.",

Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.\n \n Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school because it can help you make new friends, help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity, and can improve your skills on specific things. If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people, but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy because most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured.\n \n Being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that. Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.\n \n Generic_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. When he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high schoolÂ and was really looking forward to it.",

        "Today was a long day at school wasn't it? You did a lot of work. Studied hard. Maybe you even spent two blocks typing an essay for your SOL. Wouldn't it be nice to take a break and do something you enjoy? I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n \n To start, activities can help kids make new friends and socialize. An article published by NOVA stated that \"\"87% of students that participate in after schoolÂ activitiesÂ make a friend that they previously weren't friends with.\"\" That's a large number. Based on the study, students make friends more frequently when they are in the same club or activity as someone with the same interest as you. I think that making new friends and having fun in an activity is something everyone should experience. In the same article, it states that \"\"kids that share the same interest tend to develop a stronger friendship than kids with opposite interest and personalities.\"\" The easiest way to find someone that shares interest with you is to go to a club or activity. You'll meet people with the same liking as you. I actually met my best friend at a extracurricular activity. We were both in the same club, meaning we share somewhat of the same interest, so we started talking more, and we became best friends.\n \n Another reason is, kids can take a break from school and relax for a while. A study done by the Virginia Health Department shows that \"\"the average kids aged 11 and older that play a sport or do an activity they love, have their stress level decreased by up to 67%. It can also help clear their mind from all the bad and corruption going on around them.\"\" When I play basketball, everything that I'm thinking about clears and I stay focused on the game. At that point, I know longer feel stressed or worried about anything going on around me. I think that's always a good thing to do. Just have fun and relax. Don't be stressed or worried about anything. Just enjoy yourself. Another article by Richard Sampson, writer for the Washington Post, stated that \"\"playing a sport or participating in an activity showed to be just as effective, if not more effective than meditation. It clears and calms the brain and body while having fun and enjoying oneself.\"\" Having fun, and being stress free? That sounds like a win-win situation to me. I think it's a great thing to do. You lose stress and have fun. Why wouldn't you want to do an extracurricular activity?\n \n On the other hand, students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity if the don't want to. A study done by the LoudounÂ County Public Activities Club (LCPAC) showed that students that were forced to sign up for and activity didn't have fun or enjoy them self. I don't think that making someone sign up for an activity is a good idea because they won't have fun. However, it's always good to try something new. If they don't like the activity they signed up for, then they don't have to do it next time. Try something else. Activities are supposed to be a fun, enjoyable time.\n \n To bring it all together, extracurricular activities should be something all students do. It brings fun, joy, new friends, and takes away stress and anxiety. That sounds like a great opportunity to me. Contact your principal at school. Get activities started at your school. Or, sign up for one outside of school. Trust me, you will love it!",

You can join a club and meet new friends and new people, you can find things that you like to do that you never even knew you liked.\n \n Every kid needs to be doing outside of school, i heavily suggest sports for kids, more importantly a team sport. Being on a team sport teaches you how to be a leader and a team player. At the same time you are getting great exercise that your body needs. Kids need to be kids and having them play sports is a great way to let them go and be kids. You learn a lotÂ of valuableÂ life lessons when you play a sport, some that might stick with you your whole life. Also kids doing something like playing sports or volunteering somewhere can help from get kids off the streets getting involved with drugs and committing crimes.\n \n Besides sports and doing things outside of school, another great way to get into and extracurricular activity is joining a club. Joining a club could be beneficial for someone who has a hard time making new friends. If you join a club you might find yourself interested in something you never even knew that you liked. Say you have a hard time making new friends, if you join a clubs that has to do with something that you really like you are bound to find some new friends because you are surrounding yourself with other people who have the same interests that you do. Also more schools should have more variety of clubs and things to do after school to make school a more enjoyable place.\n \n Another great thing about participating in extracurricular activities is that you can find new hobbies that you like that you never even heard of or that you've never tried. If your not sure if you should join that club or play that sport just do it, because if you don't and you realize what could've been a good experience is thrown away because you did notÂ want to try anything new. It's okay to step out of your comfortÂ zone every now and then. It may be fun or it may not, you just got to find yourself and what you like, experimenting with things is great for you. Don't second guess yourself, the more you second guess the more your talking yourself out of doing it.\n \n InÂ conclusionÂ it should be schools jobs to make sure kids are putting themselves in clubs and sports etc. to succeed and have a better life. I highly agree with my principle making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity inside and outside of school, my principle needs a raise. Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Have you ever wanted to do something but where to lazy to do it? I agree with Making kids participate in an extracurricular activity because it would fix this problem by making kids participate. One reason why Being forced to participate in an extra curricular activity could benefit these kids is because it could make them more have more hobbies and goals. The next reason why making them participate in extracurricular activities would be good for them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and become successful of them. Another reason why forcing them to participate would be good is because It could allow them to develop better social skills and become a better person.\n \n One reason why forcing them to do activities would benefit them is how they could develop new hobbies and goals. For example, when I started swimming my parents forced me to go to practice even when I didÂ notÂ want to. Now I am a competitive swimmer and enjoy going to practice because I have goals that I want to accomplish. This example shows how making someone participate in something can sometimes benefit them by giving them new hobbies and goals. Another example is when my parents signed me up for the river hawkÂ running program at my school and I did not enjoy running. But now I have made running one of my hobbiesÂ and I will try out for my high schoolsÂ cross countryÂ team. This example shows how I was being forced Into running and started out not liking it but now I do. These examples show how being forced into doing something can benefit you by giving you goals and a chance to pursue something.\n \n The next reason why I think making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and then become successful in them. An example is how my parents forced me to swim and now I will be on TVÂ swimming in Florida at the national level for my age group. This example shows how I was successful and because I was forced to be a swimmer I made it on TV. Another example is how my mom forces me to go to school and I have become a successful student and have been getting all A grades. Another example of how making students participate in an extracurricular activity could make them more successful Is how my brother became a successfulÂ piano player. My parents made him start taking Piano lessons and now he has become great at Piano and may try to become are school Piano player. This example shows how my brother became successful by my parents making him start piano. All of these examples show how It would be good for the principle to make the students participate in an activity because it would make them a more successful person.\n \n Another reason why making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them Is how they could develop better social skills and become a better person. An example of this is when I was in fourthÂ grade and I did not like to talk to people. But when my parents signed me up for a activity after school that would help go around helping people and do food drives I became involved with the program and started to talk to people finding ways to help others. This example shows how I developed better social skills and I became a better person by helping others. Another example of how extracurricular activities help develop myÂ social skills is when I joined my first Triathlon team I had work hard to keep up with my team and cheer for other teammates. This example shows how I was using social skills to cheer for my teammates and why extracurricular activities could benefit students.\n \n I agree with Making students do extracurricular activities. One reason why I think making kids do extracurricular activities would be a good Idea Is because they can develop new hobbies and make goals for themselves to achieve.

        "Should all students be required to do an extracurricular activity? Yes, I do agree that all students should do some form of activity. There are many types of after school activities that students can participate in, including clubs, sports, debate teams, and so much more. I myself have done so many extracurricular activities. So many I couldn't count them all. I do believe that all students should do a extracurricular activity because, it can improve friendships and social interaction, encourage good exercise and motivation in work, study, and nutrition habits, and make it easier for students with health problems to interact with other kids their age and feel involved.\n \n Friends are very important in our lives. When were kids mostly everyone finds that one person who you can laugh with, make jokes with, have your own secret language, and just be kids! If you ever had that one person, think back to how you met them. Did you just bump into themÂ going down the street and all of a sudden ya'll were best friends? That might be a slight possibility but fighting the odds you most likely met your childhood best friend by doing something that you like to do. Thats right an activity! Children need best friendsÂ and whether they try out for the football team or join the debate team, I do believe that you will find a new best friend.\n \n Although friends and a very important thingÂ in a stable childhood, exercise and motivation has just as much as a positive or negative consequence on your life. Motivation is a enormous thing that can push you to do anything that you want to do. Joining teams and clubs will not only make you friends but give you peers and trusted adults that will be right behind you for whatever you choose to do. Motivation is also the key to exercise. exercising as a kid will keep you a happy and healthy person for years to come. As the years do come youll find yourself in great habits, keeping yourself healthy. Healthy habits are not the only thing. Its proven that the happier and healthier you are the more you may put into your life. If you just sit on the couch all day not doing anything, your not going anywhere with your life.Â Good exercise and good motivation are very important things and inheriting those traits just from joining a sport or club, is a huge win.\n \n Now lets talk about the children who are physical and mentally challenged. Yes, they might not have the same mindset as you and me, or can't move some part of their body, but that does notÂ mean that they shouldnt have just as much as a chance as you and me. I think incouringing special education students to enjoy the wonders of childhood are just as important as it was for everyone else in the world. When you involve these children, at that second they won't see that their different, they will see thatÂ their with kids their age having fun. Because their kids, they should have equal opportunities as other kids. Let them joinÂ that sports team if they are willing to do and and have their mind set on what they want to do. Who is to stop them?\n \n As more and more children start to do extracurricular activities more and more will follow. So Yes, I do believe that children should be pushed to do extracurricular activities, because if they dont, they might have just given up a huge part of their childhood that they might never get back. As you get older you might still have that best friendÂ still sticking around, or you might still have those study habits and healthy habits, or you might have had been a person that decided to be such a kind person and have that special education kid join your friend group as because you knew everyone needs a friend. No matter what it is, all their is to know is that you gained something so positive that will be stuck with you for decades.Â Â",

Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.\n \n Second it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.\n \n Third is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress. The activites could cause the child to lost sleep and that could leave the child tired and stressed for the rest of there school day. Next it could cause to much stress and that can lead to unwanted sideffects, like hair lost pail coloring of skin, hair loss and suicidal thoughts which isnt good.\n \n Thats whyI think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity.Â",

It is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.\n \n It is our life not the principals. If we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. Principals job is to be in chargeÂ when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. Life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. We are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. We should get to decide our own path not the principal.\n \n Most kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. They might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. Extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.\n \n Kids don't always have time. Some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. They need their families help to fight through these tough times. If they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. If the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. Everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.\n \n I disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. I don't think forcing people to do them is the answerÂ to every bodiesÂ problems. Extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family.

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricularÂ activity because it helps with college prep, helps with stress, and doesn'tÂ take much time.\n \n Working on a extracurricular can helps you prepare for college. When you send in your college application they not only look a grades but what you bring to the table. If you play football they might want you for there football team or if you play in band they might want you for there school band. Colleges also give out scholarships for certain activities. If you were good enough at your extracurricular you may even qualify for financial help to pay for college.

Colleges look at these kinds of things its important to be prepared and accomplished.\n \n Taking a break in the middle of the day and going to a fun class that you choose can really help with stress. It lets you take a break between your academic classes. You some times end up sitting for hours doing math,science, and reading you can become tired and stop focusing. Taking a hour to thirty minutes to stretch, run around, and talk is good for you it can help with your drowsiness and boredom.

Many students have things to do at home and extracurricular could be stopping them from doing them.\n \n Extracurricular activities take time away from students being with their family's, it would also take time away from activities outside of school like a sport they play or something that they participate in. Extracurricular would make students have no time to do there homework or finish any work that they need to do. Many students don't focus on extracurricular and they want to get a good grade. But extracurricular might make them not have much time to study or finish there work. And sometimes students just don't want to do any extracurricular activities.\n \n If a student does not want to do a activity than they should'ent do it. And if all students have to do extracurricular than it would get to crowded and people will lose more interest in what they like to do as a extracurricular activities. Sometimes students have a hard day at school and they just want to go home and relax. Because they are stressed and don't want to do anything, but if they are forced to a extracurricular activity that they don't like than they will be even more tired and bored. Students need there own free time and choose what they want to do and they don't want to be forced to do something they don't like.\n \n So in conclusion, students should not be forced to do extracurricular because they have things to do at home and they don't want to be stressed even more. Students go to school to learn, get good grades, so that they can get a good job. Students should be able to use there own free time and not waste it on extracurricular activitys, because they miss time with there family, they could miss out on something really important at home, and they wouldent have time to get to practice if they play a sport, all because of extracurricular that will take up most of there time. Students already have a lot of homework to and regular work to do at home and if there are required to do a extracurricular activity, they will lose a useful amount of time. Â",

        "At first it might seem absurd forcing kids to participate in extracurricular activities, but itÂ would be beneficial for the students now and later in life. This is because the activities can provide students with life long important tools. For the benefit of the students, I believe that kids should be pushed to participate in extracurricular actives. I believe this willÂ benefits the students in a variety of ways that include making new friends, being more productive, and allowing for more success in life.\n \n One of the main reasons that making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be beneficial to students is the fact those activities allow for new friendships to be created. This is true because most extracurricularÂ activities allow students to talk with each other, andÂ talking with a person is the first step towards friendship. One of the biggest issues facing teenagers isÂ depression, but if they had a place thatÂ madeÂ them feel comfortable that would help. An extracurricular activity would be perfect to make them feel like they belong. Those friends would also most likely stay with them their entire lives.\n \n A second reason making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be helpful is it could allow them to be more productive. This is because most extracurricular activities are only open for a small amount of time after-school, for anything fun to be accomplished they would have to be productive. Some activities like working on the yearbook,Â and student council have deadlines, which can teach students how or why to be productive in school. Teaching students about deadlines can also go in their future by preparing them for a college or a job.\n \n The third main reason that making students participate in extracurricular activities is positive is it allows them to feel successful. It is important for them to feel successful because they will strive to be successful in other aspects of their lives allowing for more success that can alsoÂ help them in the long term. One being if they join a good club then they can place that on their resume for college, allowing them to get a good job. On the contrary, if they didn't want to or couldn't afford college the club could go right on their resumeÂ in order for them to join the work force.\n \n In conclusion, we should make students participate in extracurricular activities for many reasons, but the three most prominent being it will give them the chance to make friends, teach them about productivity, and will allow for success even after school has ended for them. Extracurricular activities allow for a students to create meaningful lasting friendships. They also allow for students toÂ learn the importance of productivity for the future. The activities teach students how to be successful and why for short term and long term goals.",

Some might think that they shouldn't but it helps. because it helps in the real world, it helps you be in better shape and it's fun. Those are some reasons, now lets getÂ into deeper detail.\n \n Doing after school activities help in the future, especially if your trying to get a job. They help you with skills you will need to get a job. Like playing on a sports team and the fight to the #1 seed. Helps you because if your trying to get a promotion then you know how it feels to work hard for something that you want. there are also things that can help you get a job like helping take pictures for a yearbook. You could be a photographer.\n \n Doing after school activities also keep you in better shape by keeping you up after school instead of going home and doing nothing. Sports also keep you in good shape by exercises, running and conditioning drills. Also for sports you sometimes have to be fit and well put together so if your not your not making the team.\n \n They are also fun, because for yearbook on school spirit days you get to be out of class taking pictures for people with school spirit. Also wearing your football jersey on a school day makes you feel like your in a high schoolÂ football movie. It also feels so good to get on the field and make a play.Â One of the most fun things in sports if not the most fun thing is a bus ride back after a win.\n \n Those are some reasons why I support his statement on everyone should do after school activities.

        "Would you like your parents being disapointed in you beacause you didn't do well in your grades? They say your always focusing on school sports, being, council, etc. They think you don't focus on your school work. That might not be the reason, you could be struggling in your studies because of the school activity your told to do. i know my parents would be disapointed in me for having bad grades. I definetly don't support the principles decision of making it a requirement for students to participate in an activity.\n \n Some parents make their kids run errands, doing so may lead them to not be able to participate. They might have younger siblings they have to watch over which makes it hard as well. Students of extra assistance might not be able to do the activities. As the year will go by, studies will get more advanced. Students might get stressed, with the activity on their hands they might get more stressed. I know how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed as a student, things are harder to get done with being pressured. People have different things going on in their lives, it might be hard for them to go to school if there family are not in their llife as much. They could live far away from the school and have no tranportation for school or attending their own game practices.\n \n I think they should require only what is mandatory to pass the current grade students are in. Sport, running for student council, or participating in a school related event should be optional. Some people don't like participating in sports and all these other things, it just might not be their thing. Parents might wanna put their kids in tutoring after school because of their grades, but unfortunatly they can't because they got game practice or school duties. All of these problems caused by the principles decision will lead to students transferring to another school. It might also put a bad name on the school.\n \n The staff and teachers at the school might be paid a smaller amount of money than their regular pay. If there are no students at the school, the teachers might quit their jobs. The school might shut down, we can't let this happen. If we all work together we can make a big change! We can talk the principle out of this, make students happy, and parents proud again! The parents and students lives wont be so stressful anymore.\n \n Finally, that is why i reject having to participate in an school activity. I want to study stress free and have my life at ease. Students should participate in school activities only if they want to. They shouldn't be forced to if it's not required. I would reccomend the principle to come out with more previleges to help students with their studies intead!",

When you have so much work, and so little time to do things you love like spending time with your family the homework gets in the way of that. School takes over your life which is a good thing, and a bad thing. It can be a good thing because you learn so much which can help you excel in life, but it can take the life you should be living when your a kid. A kid should be able to play outside with friends, and go to the pool to swim but they can't.\n \n Making a kid have to do more school work, and stay longer at school would just give them more stress. More stress would make a kid become overwhelmed, and not do as well as they used to with less stress. Adding a extra activity to a kids life would just take away the name kid, a kid should be with his/her family, or outside running around. Schools need to have extra actives for kids, but they should never force a kid to do them.\n \n Don't make a kid work more and add more stress to their life you should be taking away the stress.\n \n As a kid to much work just makes a kid not want to work. If you force a kid into adding an extra activity to their seclude it just ruins the childhood they should be having. A kid should make his/her own choices in which what they want to do as a kid.

I believe that all kids should get to chose either if they want to do the extra activities or if they don't. School is just one big heartbreaking place where kids have to sit around all day, and then go eat food which no one knows what it actually is.",

        "According to Dr. Maxwell Olchena, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains, participating in marching band can do one of two things depending on your personality, just wait until you see what his studies have proven! I think it's very important to do an extra curricular activity, but I do not believe it should be required, as we just do not have enough options for extra circulars to fit every student's desires. Some extra circulars, such as marching band, are not for the light of heart and truly are scary at points(especially drum line but we'll get into that later.) This is why students should do extra circulars, but it should not be a requirement.\n \n Dr. Maxwell Olchena is a psychologist who has been studying the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains for almost 20 years, here's what his studies have shown: there are two things marching band can do to the brain of an adolescent, and however they are affected depends on their personality and nothing to do with IQ(Intelligence quota). Those with higher IQs tend to perform better in marching band, although marching band does not require you perform well(as hard work brings good performance.) The two things that can happen to the brain of an adolescent when they join marching band are, increased mood and productiveness, or decreased mood and productiveness, thats right. Marching band can do two polar opposite things to the adolescent brain. Dr. Olchena's studies have shown that when someone considered an extrovert joins marching band, their mood will decrease and they will become burnt out, this is because they aren't used to the amount of work put into their social life. Marching band is less a sport and more of a social activity, unless you are willing to accept it as your only family, you will not be happy and become very burnt out. Here's where Olchena's studies get crazy, introvertsÂ are more likely to have increased moods and increased productiveness when joining marching band. Olchena's studies have also shown that when and introvert joins marching band, they become more social, and those around them report and increase in socializing. Now here's where this relates to every extra curricular, Olchena had his friend, and fellow psychologist, Dr. Alan Russell study this in his area of study, debate team, and the exact opposite is true for this extra curricular. Introverts tend to lose productiveness and have a decrease in happiness, whereas extroverts tend to have increased productiveness and mood.\n \n Drum line, however, is where the studies get interesting. Dr. Brock Hayman, an expert in the effects of drum line on the adolescent brain, has discovered a new area of the brain that awakens the second you join drum line. This area is called the DrumbolowÂ Cortex. When activated, this area of the brain never turns off. The DrumbolowÂ Cortex does some weird things to the brain once activated, it can cause the person to do crazy things, such as picking up gum on the ground of the parking lot at band camp(This has actually happened before.) Other signs that this area has been activated are: inability to stop drumming, addiction to buying drumsticks, need to move up rankings in drumlins, and recruiting more people for the drum line. studies show that 90% of people do not even have this area in their brain, and fewer than 5% of the population has it activated.\n \n These are all good reasons why you should join an extracurricular(*cough cough drum lineÂ cough cough*,) so why shouldn't it be a requirement? Dr. Brett Staudt, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on people's actions around family members, has the answer to your question. \"\"Those who chose to join marching band will become a disturbance to their family, they will become obsessed with showing their family shows by Drum Corps International, such as the Cavaliers 2011 show in which the drums are upside down. Most of the population does not care whatsoever about how amazingly cool it is to drum upside down, but any person who chooses to join marching band, even if they don't do drum line, will become obsessed with the fact that people have enough skill to play the tenors upside down.\"\" This quote says two things, you should watch the Cavaliers 2011 show, and also that marching band has negative effects on the life of family members of the person who chooses this curse/blessing of an activity, not to mention, you'll never see that person again because they'll always be at practice or hanging out with their marching band friends.\n \n Although I do believe it is a good idea to do an extra curricular, Dr. Nathan Strain has done countless studies on forcing adolescents to partake in things, and it causes them to be less interested in what they're doing. I would rather not have people in marching band who are there only because they've been forced to be there, as they will not work as hard because all they care about is the fact that they have to do it. When students have free will and the ability to make their own decision, they will choose what they feel is best for them selfÂ and we should let them do whatever they believe is best for their situation in life at the moment. You never know what else a student has to do at home just to have enough money for food, or to pay for other expenses.\n \n What I take away from this evidence is that we should not force students to participate in extra curricular, but rather encourage them to do so. Personally, joining drum line was the best choice(I'm kidding it was a mistake but I'm glad I made it) I've ever made and I will continue doing drum line for the rest of my high school and college career, although had I been forced, I'm not sure if I'd be as happy to be in it. I genuinely think forcing students to do anything will cause burnout and decrease happiness. I truly think students should make their own decision on if an extra curricular fits in their life or not.

        "There are many different types of people at school. There are athletes, creative, hard-working, and many others. If they were told that they had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school, I think there would be multiple opinions about it. I think that students should not be forced into doing a school activity for three reasons. Their time, their effort, and their stress.\n \n The first reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples time/schedule. If someone for example, would choose sports and the sports practices were after after school. If they didn't have the time to practice from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. or couldn't practice form 5:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. then it would be a pretty rough schedule. Another example is when I was playing basketball for my Middle School team. We had practice everyday and it was very tiring. Some people might just want to go home and sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv instead of doing a activity. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of time.\n \n The second reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples effort. Some people might not like any of the options that the school offers so they might not put all their effort into whatever activity they pick. For example, if a very creative and artistic person looks at all of the options and they are all sport related they will not really care what they pick because that is not what they really like to do. Another example is when my cousins and I went to a arts and crafts place where you could build or draw anything you could imagine. I didn't put as much effort as some as my cousins because arts and crafts is not mt favorite thing to do. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of effort.\n \n Lastly, I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of stress. Some people can get stressed out very easily when they have to do something new or there is a lot to do. For example, if someone was taking all of the most advanced classes you could take and then they had to choose something else to worry about could make a lot of stress. They would have a lot because of how much stuff they would have to worry about. Another example is when I was playing basketball and trying to study for 3 tests I had the next day. It was a lot of stress and made me get headaches because I was focused on too much. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of stress.\n \n I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of three reasons. Their time and how it can make your schedule crazy. Their effort and how much a person likes the options or not. And lastly their stress and how it can make your life have to much to handle.Â Â",

        'GOALLLLLL!!!!\n \n Whether it\'s playing sports, participating in student council, school plays, or just painting in art club, all teens and students need that extra confidence, and adrenaline boost that extracurricular activities provide. Principle of Generic_School, Generic_Name, is proposing a new, controversial school rule that states, ""All students at BRMS\n \n must participate in at least one extracurricular activity throughoutÂ the year."" Should his rule be enforced or shot down? If you were to compare the pros and cons, the answer is yes! Not only will this rule be beneficial to all of the students physical and mental health, but forcing kids to branch out and do extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person.\n \n The first reason why . Generic_Name\'s rule should be enforced is pretty clear. By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not have signed up for on their own, they are forced out of their shell and meet new people who share similar passions. In a pole taken at Southern Utah Middle School, the students were asked approximately how many friends they had and generally how they met. The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, and etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don\'t only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that\'s 7 out of 10! Forming bonds with new people can help with trust and relationship issues and can all be done through simply being forced to branch out and participate in an extracurricular activity at your school.\n \n Another meaningful reason for the students to be forced to enjoy extracurricular activities is because of their mental and physical health. World renown author of several New YorkÂ Times awarded self-help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Steigerwald explains, ""Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too."" Steigerwald is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Engstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. He remembered, ""I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,"" he shuddered, ""Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind."" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after schoolÂ on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle.\n \n Having a clear head spaceÂ has been proven to help with academics, and participating in extracurricular activities has proven to help clear your mind. In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. GPAs in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schoolsÂ around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, ""Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and everyday the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it\'s vital for these college students."" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial.\n \n Although it\'s pretty clear that Generic_Name\'s rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take SOLs and other tests. Do SOLs make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and ""pursuing happiness"" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, ""being happy"". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather then loners, who study, work, and textÂ by themselves. This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier.\n \n In the end, the rule should be passed and all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It will not only be beneficial for their mental health, happiness, and social life, but also for academics and physical activity.Â',

        "If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities can help students with things like building new and helpful experiences, preparing for the future, discovering more about their interests, and socializing with their peers.\n \n Joining a certain group for an extracurricular activity can help you make experiences that can open up different pathways for you in the future. If you ever wanted to pursue a career in a certain field, extracurricular activities that you participate in now can help you prepare for what those might be. For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in a job like graphic design, it could be helpful to join an art club or even yearbook club. When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in. Yearbook club, for example, allows you to design a cover for the school yearbook, which would in turn give you the experience of designing covers. A poll performed by Oxford University has showed that 76% of people who now have jobs in the art field participated in some kind of extracurricular activity at school when they were students to help them learn more about what their future jobs would be like. It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college. Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom. The more activities that you participate in both inside and outside of school, the more qualified you are to go to certain colleges because of your strengths. It helps prepare you for different paths in the future. Participating in extracurricular activities such as clubs and teams can not only help you build experiences for the future, but it can also help you discover what you're passionate about.\n \n If you decided to join in on an activity that you can participate in as an extracurricular, it might help you discover what you enjoy doing.Â At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.\n \n Participating in things like clubs, sports teams, or student council gives students the opportunity to meet new people and branch out.Â When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others. This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people. Most activities like these use team efforts. For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills. Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers. You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities. The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy. Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are. Teammates have to cooperate with each otherÂ and work together in order to accomplish tasks. This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime.Â This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars .\n \n For the reasons that I have provided as well as other ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's encouraged that more students participate in extracurricular activities. There are clearly many ways that it would help improve students' lives. It can help them with their passions, socializing with people who share interests or views, and can help students with making new experiences to assist them in the future. Many schools offer a variety of different activities to join that many of the students already find to be enjoyable. Because of the points made, if my principal ever decided that all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with her decision.",

        "Should all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity? Here are some things that might be helpful to get an answer. Some students might have other work to do from school, students may have other activities after schoolÂ or outside of school, and students might become more stressed from extracurricular activities. Those are some things that might be helpful to answer if students must participate in an extracurricular activity.\n \n First, Students might have other work from school that they have to finish at home or after school. Students might have homework, missing work, or late assignments from school that need to be completed on their own time. If students are not able to finish a certain assignment because of an extracurricular activity, it could possibly lower the students grade. If there is an extra class in school, students will most likely have more homework at the end of the day. Students need to finish other work outside of school.\n \n Second, Students may have other activities after schoolÂ or outside of school. Some students need to stay after school to retake a test, do late or missing work, or even just get extra help from a teacher. Students also need time outside of school to collect community service hours to graduate from high school. Students may have school or non-school related classes at home that they need to take such as a tutor, church/religion classes, etc. So students may need extra time for after schoolÂ or non-school related activities.\n \n Finally, students might become more stressed from another extracurricular activity. If some students have low grades, adding an extracurricular activity might overwhelm the student or stress him or her out. If students have a lot of work to complete, they might rush through everything instead of taking their time and being careful. And lastly, students might not be able to keep up with the extra class or work and their parents might keep pushing them on which will again, stress the student out. So students might become more stressed with an extracurricular activity.\n \n So should students really have to participate in an extracurricular activity? I have come to a conclusion. I disagree because students might have other work from school to do at home, students may have other activities outside of school, and students might become more stressed. Those are the three main reasons why I disagree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity.",

        "I think that this would probably be a good idea. The reason i think this will be a good idea is because the kids have a chance to find there passion if they did not yet already. It may also give the kids a chance to stay active instead of going home and just going on there phones. They can help the school with extra stuff like help making the yearbook. This also can make a student get creative if they want to make there own after school club.\n \n The reason kids have a chance to find there passion is because of the choices that the schools has. If the kid is athletic then the school must have all the sports as a choice and the kid can choice what he likes and if his first pick isnt his favorite he can just choose another sport until he finds the one he likes. Then once he likes it he can join a actual team and get good at it. Or if the school has a actual team for that sport he can tryout and see if he makes the team. If the student likes art they can go the a art class and either work on there art or try to get better and try new art techniques. If the student is into acting or something like that they can do drama class and act in plays and practice there acting skills.\n \n Another reason why i think this is good is because it can keep the kids busy instead of them going home to play on there phones. The students can help the teachers with makingÂ yearbooks andÂ if they are good enough they can also take some pictures of the clubs. They can help make events or even if they can they can try to make a fundraiser. They can help pass out material to the teachers for there clubs like paper or pencils if they need it. If they do good they can be rewarded because of there good acts.\n \n Third reason why i think this is good is because the kids can get creative. They can get creative by making there own club. And by putting the club together and also thinking of what other they can do to make other kids join. They have to get an idea on how to make the club interesting and how other kids will like it and want to join. They will have to get all the ideas together and make the club that they want to make.\n \n These are the reasons why i think the principles choice of making a extracurricular activity is a good idea.",

I disagree because the student may not really want to play a sport or do any other kind of activity. Also, the student may be a shy person, or they may have social anxiety issues. Finally, what if he/she has other things they do at home? For example, they could be playing a sport that is not connected to the school, or they have their own job perhaps. I would not force a student to do any activity at school.\n \n We should not force students at school to do activities of any kind. If you wanted a student to try a sport or a club, you should try to persuade them to try it out. For example, I'm trying to persuade you that the principal should not force students to do any activity, so the principal should try to persuade the student to try something new.

        "What do you think about extracurricular activities? I believe that with amazing extracurricular activitiesÂ can inspire a student to have a new hobby, or learn more about them self. On the other hand, a bad one can make a student want to quit liking the activity and do something else. My principal decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with making students participate in an extracurricular activity because of time, money, and a negative impact on everyone.\n \n The first reason is time. Some students might not have enough time to do an extracurricular activity, which could cause the student to have stress. The teacher might lose passion for what they are teaching because of more students, who are being forced to take an extracurricular activity against their will, coming to their after school activity. If the teacher didn't get an influx of students who were forced to take his class, then the they would not have been worn out as fast, or even at all. This will, over time, slowly wear down the teacher, making the class less enjoyable for everyone. Overall, time will be a large problem with forcing students to do extracurricular activities.\n \n The second reason is money. With more students participating, more supplies need to be bought. There might not be enoughÂ money to pay for all of the things students do in an after school activity. The students might not be able to go on trips because they cost to much. People would also be very unhappy if they have to pay for extracurricular activities that their kid was forced into. In the end, there might not be enough money to pay for all of the extracurricular activities.\n \n The final reason is the negative impact it can have on everyone. The teachers will be very stressed becauseÂ they have many students who don't care about that activity. The students will also have plenty of tension because they now have to stay at school longer, and manage another activity every day. If the students are stressed, the effect is that their grades will drop. In all, it can cause everyone to have more unneeded tension.\n \n In conclusion, I don't think making students participate in an extracurricular activity is a great idea. It could help students become more social, but it can cause more problems than it solves. It wouldn't be good if the students or teachers were unhappy because of the principal making students participate in after school activities. I believe extracurricular activities are used to show students new activities and have fun.",

        "Extracurricular Activities Shouldn't Be Forced\n \n Have you ever been forced to do something you didnt want to do? Did you do the task happily? Most people would say it was not an enjoyable experience. When talking about the topic of extracurricular activities in schools, it is definitely something that shouldn't be mandatory. These things shouldn't be forced because it will result in unhappy and resentful students. Also, students should be able to choose their hobbies, and it is frankly none of the school's business.\n \n If we force students to participate in a list of activities that may not cater to their interests, it is only going to make unhappy students who don't actually put any effort into the thing they are being forced to do. Again, try and think back to a time when you were made to do something you didnt want to do. Something that took time away from things you actually wanted, or even needed to do. You probably didn't do that thing with a whole lot of thought and effort, or at least you didn't do it in a good mood. What's the point of forcing kids to do activities, if they are just going to do it sloppily, with zero effort. No matter how many options a school provides, there will always be kids who don't like any of them.\n \n Even though they may not like any of the options at school, whose to say they don't enjoy something outside of school. For example, what if a student is really passionate about their art? And between their chores and school work, they only get work on it about an hour of their day. Now, because they are forced to play a sport or join a club, they have absolutely no time to work on what brings them joy. This defeats the whole purpose of an extracurricular activity.\n \n Even if everyone was perfectly happy with the activity they have to do, why is it any of the schools business what people do with their free time? A school's job is to give students a safe place to learn, and to provide optional extracurricular activities. It's not a schools job to control so much of a students life, that it's even taking up time outside of school. Schools have no idea what goes on in a student's life, and it is unfair for them to assume everyone just has the time and want to do an additional thing outside of school. If a student wants to participate in something, they will. There is no need to force people to do things they dont want to do.\n \n As you can see, the idea of making an extracurricular activity mandatory has many downsides. So many that it is obviously it is not a good idea. Making people do things they don't want to do has never turned out good. Students need the freedom to make their own choices, and the school should have nothing to do with that. No matter how many benefits, extracurricular activities should never be mandatory.Â",

        "Even though a lot of school aged kids participate in after school activities, there are still a lot who don't. Some of them don't participate because theres nothing they like. There are also some kids that act like since they arent forced to do the activities then they won't ever do them, which may set them back in life. Most activities can be so fun, exciting, and interesting. In addition, there are a lot of benefits to participating in such activities, they keep you active and healthy, makes interact with others, and they can keep you busy. So if the principal was to make kids participate in one after school activity that would be a great and wonderful idea.\n \n People who commit to an activity of some sort can stay active and have a healthier mindset compared to a person who doesnt participate. For example, if you sign up for volleyball club after school after the principal made the announcement that you have too. You now not only have a way to exercise but also an activity to help take your mind off everything else. Even if you sign up for a learning club or activity, like a \"\"teaching you how to eat healthy club\"\", can impact your life. But you can get healthier after participating in a club or activity. If your going through a rough time then for some people a good thing would for you to do something other than mope around about it. You can developÂ good sportsmanshipÂ and other great qualities of a person. In other words many good influences can come off of having to do an activity.\n \n Interaction with other people is almost a given when participating in any sort of activity. Human interaction is a huge part of everything in our world. But so many people today have a hard time with it for many different reasons. So if you start at a younger age, trying to get better to interact with people, you'll get set for the rest of your life. As you interact and talk to people you learn a lot. You developÂ a sense of great team work and friendship. So many friendships are started when you start talking to people at these actives. You'll feel not alone and a great friend can rub off some good traits, making you a better person. In conclusion, interaction is great to do and going to these activities will help you interact with people.\n \n Activities make you stay busy, and take up your time in a good way. People who don't participate in activities will get bored easily and often. While someone who does participate in one will have a lot more to do. For example, if you participate in a spring lacrosse league and on a random Sunday you get bored you can practice lacrosse in your backyard. Another example might be if you participate in boy scouts or girl scouts you may have homework to do before your next meeting. But all a person has that doesn't participate in any activities is sitting on their bed or a couch on their phones. Then every hour theyll think to themselves how bored they are. Participating in activities gets you busy and not as bored as often.\n \n Making kids participate in any activity, or sport is a great idea. Why? Well because great benefits come from participating in activities like keeping you active, interacting with others, and keeping you busy. Whatever you do whether its a club, sport, or just a plain activity of some sort, many opportunities can show up for you. A new passion developed can introduce a job oppritunity or hobby. Doing activities is a wonderful experience that you have to do yourself. Even if you might not completely like what youre doing at first. Who knows maybe you'll find your new passion and hobby.

Because it relieves stress and make students look forward to school, can also be good for the school, and help student figure out what they want to do after they are done with school.\n \n I think that these school activities are good because the student can use these activities as a way to relieve stress by reading.

        "Countless students follow the same after-school routine. After a long day at school, they joyfully return home with a smile on their face. That happiness is because while they were forced to learn and work at school, there are no expectations like that at home. As the sun rises and sets, they have the freedom to mindlessly waste the rest of the day away. That's why rather than spending time outdoors, focusing on hobbies, or spending time with friends and family, students just lock themselves into their rooms. Then, they proceed to pull out their electronics and play away until the end of the day. It's an extremely unhealthy yet addictive lifestyle. But, that lifestyle could change if students had an after-school activity to attend. They would start spending more attention to what's outside of the virtual world. Thus, it is my firm belief that every student should be required to participate in an least one extracurricular activity because it will increase student productivity, improve students' social skills, and promote student engagement.\n \n If an extracurricular activity became a requirement, students would have a more beneficial activity to attend after-school. Every day, when school comes to an end, many students find themselves with hours and hours of free time. However, they end up accomplishing nothing because they have no tasks to complete and no activities to participate in. So, they turn to their main source of entertainment- electronics. And while students are fortunate enough to have the entire day to spend on their phones and computers, no good comes out of it. That's why extracurricular activities are necessary. Students may resent it at first, but in the long run it will create significant improvements to their lifestyle. Students could spend their free timeÂ on activities more worthwhile. They could be winning a soccer championship or fund raisingÂ for those in need. The entire world is there for students to explore and discover. All students need is a small push in the right direction.\n \n Furthermore, extracurricular activities also give students opportunities to interact with their peers. It can be intimidating for students when they have to join a group of complete strangers. However, although it is nerve-wracking, students have the wonderful opportunity to make new friends. Their team will contain people of a similar age group and perhaps similar interests. Besides, with how frequent meetings are, members will be spending an abundance of time together; they're guaranteed to form new friendships. On the contrary, extracurricular activities also help maintain current friendships. It can be difficult to meet up with friends out of school, so joining an extracurricular activity allows students to get together more often. All in all, as it goes with any team, members form a tight bond with one another. By the end of the year, they'll be surprised by the amount of new friends they've made.\n \n Lastly, extracurricular activities promote students' engagement with their community. Students rarely ever have an opportunity to venture beyond their small school environment, which consequently limits the amount of change they're able to make. However, with extracurricular activities, students will have more opportunities to make an impact on their community. For example, being a part of the student council gives you many opportunities to make a difference. Members raise awareness of issues, fund raiseÂ for the needy, and even more. Being active in a team like that motivates students. With all they accomplish, they being to feel much more productive and hence acquire a sense of belonging. That results in students truly believing they can make a difference in the world, which then causes them to become more engaged and active in their community.\n \n It's common knowledge that extracurricular activities are extremely beneficial, yet many students still hesitate from participating and consequently miss out on amazing opportunities. Extracurricular activities have a much larger role than just providing entertainment. They allow students to become more productive, social, and active in their community. We can't allow students to miss out on a chance to build those skills. The experiences they obtain from the extracurricular activities will stick with them for life. Therefore, if participating becomes a requirement, our world will become a much better place. Students may have their doubts about extracurricular activities, but they will truly be tremendously changed by them. The requirement of extracurricular activities will allow our world to raise much healthier and productive generations. With just a simple requirement, the future of our society will look much brighter.Â  Â",

Like if you did soccer you could get better with your running skills. Also if you did basketball you can use your body more witch causes you to get strong. If you do play a sport and your stress you can let it go when you play like you can shoot the basketball or you can kick the soccer ball. You also make new friends that become like a family.\n \n Student council is fun you get to do lots of stuff with your school. Like you can make posters and hang them around your school that say ice cream social in one day. You can also make a poster about you running to be school president. If you get voted to be president you have to go to SCA meetings were you plan events to happen for the school and more.\n \n The school yearbook is cool. Because you can take pictures of the school and students. You get to design the year book and the cover for the book. You can also take funny pictures of your friends and put them on the yearbook. It also can be a awesome memory when you get older.\n \n Thats why I agree with the principal. Its a great way to make new friends and to let out stress so you can have a good time and enjoy the rest of your school year.",

        "Ever been rushed around? Have had so much to do in so little time? What if you had to do a extra activity on top of that? Would your life be hectic? I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activityÂ For example, time is something that passes all the time. Not all of the students can get a ride, adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. In all, adding extracurricular actives is a bad idea.\n \n Time. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscousÂ cycle. Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air.\n \n buses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figureÂ out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride.\n \n Sols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed. Making kids do something that that they don't have time to do creates a lot of stress. Students should be able to chose what they want to do. If they can handle doing extracurricularÂ activates then they can, it shouldn't be a must. Making kids do something that isn't needed will drag them down making them now want to come to school. School should be a place of safety were kids can chose what they need to succeed in life.\n \n Making kids do extra activities will make students have less time for home, not all kids can get a ride home from school, doing this will ad more stress.

        "I think that forcing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity would cause stress in many different ways. Students already have a lot of school work to do and making them do this would be difficult. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a care provider for the family, or might have a job to do. This could also result in a lack of effort in certain things at school and at home.\n \n If students have a lot of school work to do they could become stressed from not being able to get the work done. Students also might need to study and would not have time to do that, therefore, causing them to get a bad grade on it. This could also result in a bad grade on their report card, maybe even causing them to fail the class. If the students fail the class they will have to retake the class the next year, and if the students were already struggling with the class they would have to do it all over again causing stress in that way to. To much stress causes anxiety which can be harmful to the students self confidence, could make them sad or depressed, and many other problems.\n \n Students might be a main provider for their family, taking care of family members, and paying for stuff the family needs. They might also be paying the bills or buying food and clothes for their family members. If students can't provide for their family they could become homeless or become sick. Might become in debt from not having someone work and make money for the family.\n \n Students might also have a job to do and would not be able to work because they would not have time to work after school. They might also have a job so they can provide for their family or themselves. They might need the job to save up for college and schooling. If the students don't have the time to go to work they might get fired and they would not be making money to provide for family or themselves.\n \n So in my opinion, I don't think this would be beneficial in any way to the students. This would be very stressful for the students and could also cause anxiety, even making the student become depressed if it is to stressful for them. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a main care provider for their family, and might have a job to do so they can pay for the stuff that they need to live a descent life and not be stressed.

        "The principal at my school decided that all students need to take an extracurricular activity. How should I, as a student, feel about this? Do I agree with their decision? What is an extracurricular activity, and why did my principal make this decision? Figuring out the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, and how they impactthe students, will help me conclude how I feel about this choice.\n \n What are extracurricular activities? These activities are something a student could participate in to entertain or captivate them. Examples of these activities could be an art class, sports, or even a chess club. Normally, these activities are something you personally enjoy, or have a passion for. They could be in school, after school, or maybe not in school at all. One way how most schools get you to take an extracurricular activity, is by offering electives. Most schools have electives as a fun class for students, or something they enjoy learning. Another reason schools might have electives, is for the mind to grow, and find fun in certain activities. Not everyone has the same passion, so there are many options. You don't necessarily need to be good at an extracurricular activity, you just have to love, or have fun doing it.\n \n What is the reasoning behind the principalÂ forcing the students to take at least one activity? Cellphones are one of the main entertainment for teenagers, them often spending many hours a day on them. Even if you enjoy using your device, it is not the type of passion most adults would choose. Making students do an extracurricular activity might positivelyÂ give them a push to try new things. Taking an in or out of school activity may expand the students outlook on electives or clubs the school offers, and alluding for them to try something new. Going to these clubs or activities, offers new friendships as well. Other people that take the same activity as you, may also share the same passion. It is easier to connect with people who are similar to you. The principal would want the best for their school, and by making the students take an activity, they get new educational experiences.\n \n Even though these activities can have a positive effect on the students, there can also be negatives. Some students don't care about finding a passion, or an activity for them to do. They might just want to take a class that gives them an \"\"easy a\"\", not because it's something they would actually do for fun. Not only that, but some students just try to get into a class with their friend. That friend might be taking a class that doesn't interest the student. Taking a subject or activity that is boring or uninteresting to you, won't help you find what you like to do. When forcing the students to take an activity, while it might help them find their interests and explore new things, it might also force them to do unwanted subjects that don't please them.\n \n In conclusion to this prompt, I agree with the decision of the principal to make all students take an extracurricular activity. Forcing the students to take an extracurricular activity, can effect them greatly. It offers them experiences, finding what they like to do best, and discovering what they are good at. It can expand their communication with other people, and overall, make new friends. These activities, depending on what they are, can be good for your health. Some students don't particularly care about finding what they like to do, and would rather just be with their friends or use their cellular device. Making these students take an extracurricular activity, can make them discover new things that they didn't know or realize before.",

        "Have you ever tried an in-school sport or club? Many students enjoy extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. But some students aren't as keen on the idea. Some think it's a waste of time, or that they're very boring. But extracurricular activities help students and schools in many different ways. I think students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity because the students will learn new skills, students will become more social, and the school will become more diverse in it's interests.\n \n There are many skills to be learned in extracurricular activities. Depending on what activity it is, you can be taught a wide variety of talents. After school sports will teach you the basics to the game, and then maybe you'll make it to the school team for that sport. Certain clubs will teach students other games and talents. At my old school, there was a huge chess club. Some of the kids that went to it every Wednesday didn't even know how to play at first. Then they learned, as any other student could if they attended a mandatory extracurricular activity. Some clubs can even teach students the basics of just being a good student or friend, like the homework club, or the diversity club. So if every student took a mandatory extracurricular activity, everyone would learn a lot.\n \n Students can become more social through extracurricular activities. The more students spend time with people with similar interests, the more friends they'll make. If a student was to only hangout with the same group of friends all year, he or she would never become more social, which is a good skill to have as you get older. Besides, a student might make a life long friend through an extracurricular activity. Even if a student doesn't make any new friends through extracurricular activities, they'll still have learned important communication and social skills.\n \n If a school has a large variety of extracurricular activities that every student is attending at least one, the school will become more diverse in the student's intersests. Diversity in a school is very important for many reasons. Diversity would look good on how the rest of the county views the school. Then they might follow suite and make extracurricular activities mandatory. Another reason why diversity in a school is important because the students will impact each other and make each other want to try more activities, making a postitive cycle in which students want to partcipate in extracurricular activities, therefore benefiting them in the other ways, social and skill benefits.\n \n In all, mandatory extracurricular activities will help our school system in plenty of ways. They'll teach students skills, make students more social, and make the school more diverse. These are just some of the reasons that schools need mandatory extracurricular activities. If you want madatory extracurricular activities at your school, start a petitionfor your principal to see. Even if that doesn't work, you can always just convince your friends and classmates to go to these extracurricular activities. This is why I believe schools should have mandatory extracurricular activities.",

        "Have you ever wondered about the benefits of students participating in an activity? Extracurricular activities can have many things to it. Some activities can be sports,yearbook designing,student council, and many other things that students can enjoy. Students would have a great time and enjoy these types of things and can find different kinds of activities they could participate in. All students should participate in an activity because it can help students find an interest,students can enjoy it, and can help keep their minds distracted from school.\n \n Students can find different activities to find an interest/hobby. Students who don't usually participate in activities or events can find something new if they are being told to do something. Hence, making a student find an activity means that they will be searching to find one, and will lead to finding an activity they find interesting and try it out. In other words, students who doodle once in a while might find an art related activity and join. In addition, this can also help them keep an open mind and not think that all or some activities are boring or considering them as something they would never like doing. Some students might also be shy or not be involved to much in things so they might want to join an activity but are to scared to participate. This means that when students must pick an activity they can feel relieved and happy to do so.\n \n Some students can enjoy having extracurricular activities. For example, student would enjoy having activities because they can be able to do something that they enjoy instead of having class. To add to this, students that are athletic wouldn't be able to play a sport during class because it isn't allowed and would be very disruptive. Therefore, when students are allowed to choose an activity that would make them joyful and excited to join the one they connect with the most. This will also be beneficial to the class/classes that a person is in because they have already done what they wanted during their activity and it can help them focus in their classes more efficiently.\n \n The minds of students can be distracted from school related things. Students nowadays can become stressed, and can cause their brain to be less efficient. Students can be feeling down and even depressed which is a very bad situation for students since they have lots of things piled on them. Some of these things would include projects,homework, essays, and other things that can be personal to that student. Therefore, by joiningÂ an activity students can relieve their mind off certain topics and think about other things. While in an extracurricular activity they can communicate with others and can find new friends too. In addition, they can also find an activity that can help them relax and be more calm. For example, a meditation club (activity) would be very helpful or an art activity so they can draw out their emotion/feelings.\n \n Overall, students should all participate in activities. This is because it can be appealing to some students and not so appealing to others, but this can make them find different activities/opportunities and keep them open minded. Students can also find new friendships and can be distracted from school related things which keeps their minds functioning. Extracurricular activities include lots of different things and students can enjoy it and consider participating in one or more activities. Students should all join an activity because it helps them clear their minds,some students enjoy activities, and it can help students find an interest/hobby. Â Â Â",

        "A tiresome day of school just ended, but instead of being exhausted, you are exited because your extracurricular activity is about to start. Many students go to school everyday, then leave on the bus, or walk home, until returning the next day. Because a lot of students do that, the majority of them never experience any clubs that the schools works hard to put together. By making students try out a club, they would appreciate what the school has to offer. Principals should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help students be active in the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students explore some of their interests for the future.\n \n One reason that a school's principal should require students to have to participate in at least one activity after schoolÂ is so that students become active in the school once the hours of school are done. Students who stay after schoolÂ for an extracurricular activity participate in some of the schools programs. This leaves a stronger connection from the students to the school. Students can choose out of many clubs offered, and thereforeÂ feel as if they found a bigger reason to stay in school. A reason that students should be required to participate in an after schoolÂ activity is so they are more active in the school.\n \n Another reason that school principal should make kids participate in an after schoolÂ club is so that kids can interact better with others. When students join a club in school, they meet new kids, ones with similar interests as them. Because of their shared interests, students can form a bond, all because of this club. Kids would also talk with the teachers running each club activity because they have more in common, like a passion for the club. A second reason that kids should have to participate in a extracurricular activity at school is so they learn to interact better with both students and teachers.\n \n Lastly, if a school principal made students join an after schoolÂ club, students would find and explore some of their interests. Students all have their own interests and hobbies, but to find them, one would have to look. Middle and high school students are at the perfect age to explore passions because they are getting ready to pick a major in college, so they are looking high and low for an idea of what their major will be. By joining a club at your school, students will find some club that pulls at them, inviting them to join. Also, students would have time after schoolÂ to try new clubs or sports. For example, an interested student could choose to participate in the yearbook committee, or even the SCA. One last reason that students should participate in an after school club is because they can figure out some of their hobbies and passions before college.\n \n In Conclusion, if a school principal required that all students must participate in some after school club, students would become more active around the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students expand their hobbies. A student would have a bigger purpose to stay at school if they had to join a club, giving them a stronger connection to the school. The interactions between students and teachers would be higher because they would have more in common. Finally, students would explore many different career paths for college and have a varied set of interests when participating in after school clubs. Principals, by making your students participate in an extracurricular activity, you help students in a lot of ways, so consider trying out this idea for a better future for your students.Â",

As everyone knows, a lot of kids my age suffer from different types of stress. Which are mostly caused by either depression, anxiety or even loneliness. Which means that with this new opportunity they have, their depression, anxiety, and loneliness might go down a bit as they get to interact with other students while they participate in activities they might of never even tried before.\n \n The final reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will even help students develop time management skills. Most students at our school (that I know of) either don't have time or don't know how to fit everyday activities like school, homework, and free time in their everyday lives. So, since they have to participate in something new now, it might open up their eyes a bit and help them see how to distribute their time, which will result in them having some free time at the end of the day.\n \n In conclusion, I think the Principal's decision to make students attend or take an extracurricular activity is a great idea because, it improves social life, lowers stress some students might have, and also helps students develop time management skills.",

Through extracurriculars, which are also extremely important for students in the real world. I agree with my principal that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities encourage students to become more confident and brings to light their hidden qualities, while also giving them skills that will be useful throughout their whole life. Students can also discover their passion through extracurriculars, which could eventually become their life's work.\n \n Extracurricular activities instills confidence in a person and helps them show others their best qualities. If we dig deep into Neville Longbottom's school life, we discover that everything changed after he joined Dumbledore's Army, a club founded by Harry Potter to encourage the learning of Defense Against the Dark Arts. He gained confidence while he took over the club for Harry, and his true qualities of bravery and courage really shined through. Confidence is important because studies have proven that a person who is clearly confident is more respected by their peers. Possessing confidence helps a person to have good mental health as well and boosts up happiness levels by at least 80%. It is also important for a person to show others who they truly are, because hiding their true qualities creates feelings of dissatisfaction, which is overall detrimental towards a person's happiness. Helping students open up and gain confidence are just one of the several benefits that extracurriculars provide.\n \n Students gain necessary life skills as well as confidence through extracurriculars. These life skills are often skills that can only be acquired through experience. Social skills such as leadership can definitely be acquired, and it is a coveted skill that can eventually lead to success. Just look at Neville! Proof that leaders are made, not born. Students also learn the importance of commitment as well as the skill of cooperation through extracurriculars like sports. In Quidditch, a sport that requires a ton of commitment and cooperation, Harry Potter learned to drag himself out of bed at the crack of dawn and deal with foul opponents, something which would definitely help him later on in life after he became the Head of the Auror Office. One of the most important skills a person can learn while doing an extracurricular is time management. Most self-made billionaires are masters of time management. Balancing extracurriculars with school is no simple feat, and will definitely prove to be useful in the future.\n \n One of the best things about extracurriculars is that it will help a person find that passion which will fuel their life's work. By exploring different clubs and activities, a person can discover what it is that truly ignites fire in their soul. In a recent poll, 87% of the people who have a passion state that they are at least 95% happy about where their life is going. These are incredible numbers compared to the 97% of people who don't have a passion who state that they are less than 30% happy about where their life is going. Another poll has stated that less than an estimated 50% of people do not enjoy going to work. This is because they are not passionate about it. A person who hates their work will not be happy at all, which could result in early health complications. For students in particular, finding a passion is important because colleges are more favorable upon students who have a passion versus those who don't. Having a passion is necessary for happiness, and extracurriculars will help students find their passion.\n \n I strongly believe that extracurriculars are necessary. They help students gain confidence and a passion and teaches important life skills. Most importantly, they make students happy. Neville Longbottom, the former laughingstock of Hogwarts, transformed himself through an extracurricular. Even though Neville is fictional, he proves the importance of extracurriculars, and shows exactly why every student should participate in at least one.Â",

        "Whether it's a lovable hobby of yours or an aspiration, there is always a task a person loves to carry out.\n \n Mandatory extracurricular activities would be a phenomenal addition to the requirements of our school.\n \n I find this decision to be fantastic because it gives the opportunity to students to practice unknown activities and find new passions that drive them forward.\n \n In addition, the school too would benefit from the growing skills and work put out by the students through extracurricular activities.\n \n The first reason why I agree with our school in this decision, is because it will provide the opportunity for both me and my classmates to practice the unknown and find new passions for us to follow.\n \n This practicing of new activities will provide us students a development in our skills.\n \n For instance, if I were to become the head of the student council I would experience how to become a leader, the skills needed to be a leader, and how to drive my classmates to become better students.\n \n Secondly, a new drive or passion for our motivation could become discovered through the practicing of extracurricular activities.\n \n As a result of this finding of new passion or drive, both me and my classmates would be able to figure out what it is we really aspire to be in the future to come.\n \n Finally, the experience that would be provided to us through extracurricular activities, be it sports, leadership roles, or other extracurricular activities that are available to us, would be extremely helpful in our futures.\n \n Specifically, the work ethics that would be highly important in our future in college and even when having a job, these work ethics would be taught like wildfire in any extracurricular activity as long as participation and active engagement is exercised.\n \n The growing passion and drive combined with the learning of skills and work ethics will surely benefit both me and my schoolmates in the future to come.\n \n As for the second reason I support my school's decision, it is due to the fact that my classmates will not be the only to gain through the mandatory extracurricular activities rule, the growing skills along with the hard workÂ that will be progressively demonstrated by the students will surely benefit the school in more ways than one.\n \n A major part of any school, the yearbook, could be made and designed by the people who are inside of the yearbook.\n \n Specifically, the feelings, emotions and bonds created and felt throughout the year by myself and by my schoolmates, could only be expressed inside a yearbook through the people who made those bonds and felt those feelings.\n \n However, that is not the only benefit, the students of the school will also be able to make a more deep and connecting bond through both the teachers and through each other.\n \n For instance, not every club or sports team can run by a teacher or by a student, this diverse teaching environment that will be provided will prove to show a deeper connection through my schoolmates and through their main learning environment.\n \n Lastly, the improvement of attraction to our school will encourage every student to work harder and become better students along with better learners.\n \n In depth, the increased need to work hard and utilize the skills learned through extra curricular activities will increase the grades, performance, and attentiveness of many students in class and outside of class.\n \n All in all, this decision will not only grow myself along with my classmates, but the school in a whole.\n \n The third and final reason why I agree and wholeheartedlyÂ support the decision of my school is because both me and my schoolmates will be able to grow mentally, and physically through the extracurricular activities.\n \n First off, the improvements of the number of people participating in extracurricular activities will prove beneficial for people who are in study groups.\n \n As a result of the increased amount of people taking extracurricular activities, an increased amount of people will join study groups which will allow more sharing of knowledge through older members and newer members.\n \n Secondly, sports teams will be able to have more competition, therefore increasing the skill gap between players.\n \n More people participating in extracurricular activities means more people trying out for sports teams which results in a higher demand to play for the team, whether it be basketball, soccer, football or other sports, the high demand will cause an increase in specific member choosing for the teams and will also cause an increase in team spots, therefore increasing the skill of the teams and creating more ways for myself and other students to play sports and grow ourselves physically through those sports.\n \n Lastly, mental sports teams like chess, Sudoku, and other mental sports, will see the same increase.\n \n Specifically an increase of mental capacity being held by our school's students, and with this increase in mental capacity needed to play games like chess, it causes an increase in schoolwork performance, and other schoolwork related items such as tests and quizzes.\n \n The improvement in mental and physical prowess being presented will surely produce results for my schoolmates in the future to come.\n \n The addition of mandatory extracurricular activities to our school will prove to be a promising and progressive choice.\n \n Firstly, students are going to able to practice unknown activities, find new passions, and find new friends while still growing themselves.\n \n Secondly, these growing skills and hard work that will come to be expressed by both me and my schoolmates will prove beneficial not only for us, but for the school as well.\n \n Finally, students will be able to express their mental and physical growth and increase that mental and physical growth through these extracurricular activities.\n \n I believe without a doubt that the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities is the best decision our school has ever made.Â",

        "Would you like to be forced to do something you don't want to do? Of course not, students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities if they don't want to. We need to stand up for student rights, they should have the choice ifÂ they want to do activities or not. There are many reasons to support this like, the cost of essential items, students not having a way home, and most importantly most kids have to take care of younger siblings and wouldn't have time.\n \n Firstly, forcing students to do after school activities is not fair, and neither is the price to pay for it. The average cost for sports equipment if five hundred dollars, and most families can't pay that. Lets say your child decides to not do a sport and chooses to be on student council, and they have a meeting at 7:00 in the evening, someone is gonna have to take them, so there goes at least thirty dollars in gas money. So do yourself and your kids a favor and be against it.\n \n Secondly, if your child has to do an after school activity, they must get home somehow. Most parents don't get off work till six o-clock, and lets say your kids practice ends at five o-clock, or maybe even four o-clock, your child would be alone at school for more than an hour, and thats a long time. No child should have to be alone for that long and doing something they don't want to do.\n \n Lastly, if your child has younger siblings and they have to take care of they after school, they wont have time for other activities. Generic_Name is a fourteen year old girl and has a three year old sister named Generic_Name . Every day she comes home and plays with her, feeds her, and gives her everything she needs while mom isÂ at work. If Generic_Name has to stay after school for an activity, what would Generic_Name do? This was the most important reason, kids just don't have time.\n \n In conclusion, we can all agree that students should not be forced to do after school activities, the cost is to much, they may not have a way home and they might hot have time because of younger siblings to take care of. Don't let someone force your kid to do an activity they don't want to do. Next time your at a parents meeting for your kids school and the principle asks for who is against all students being forced to do an extracurricular activity, raise your hand for the sake of you and your loving, passionate kid.Â Â Â",

        "I believe that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The reason I believe this is because students need to know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities, they need to learn how to do other activities, and because many students don't do extracurricular activities. I believe the principal is right in this decision. Doing these activities is an essential in these students lives. These students must start participating in extracurricular activities.\n \n Many students need to know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities. Students need to learn how to do activities, such as playing basketball. Basketball also gives a lot of exercise, which is very important for students. If students start playing games, such as basketball, they will know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities, how to work together, and how to make decisions. I believe that participating in sports such as basketball is very important to students.\n \n Some students may already do extracurricular activities, but it is important to learn how to do other activities. It is important that students learn how to do other activities, not just one activity. If students learned how to do other activities, they can learn many other things. For example, students that work on the school yearbook can learn how to edit. Editing is a very important thing that can help students make things look nicer. It can also teach students to learn how to work together with their peers. Learning how to do other activities is a very important thing.\n \n Even though some students may already participate in these activities, many do not. Some students may play on the computer, watch TV, or even just do nothing. These students need to start trying out some extracurricular activities. If they do not, then they will never learn many of the things these activities teach. Some of these things include working together, decision making, or even learning how to make friends. These things that extracurricular activities teach are very essential in our every day lives. These students need to learn how to do these essential things in their lives.\n \n Students need to participate in extracurricular activities. The reason I support the principals decision is because students need to know how it is like to participate in these activities, they need to learn other activities, and students that don't do these activities need to start trying some out. Many people enjoy these activities. Students need to learn that these activities are good for them and that they teach many important things. I believe that if these students just tried out some of these activities, they would learn to enjoy them.",

Students should take at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future, students will get healthier if they join a sports team, and students will make for friends.\n \n Students should at least take one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future. First, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then students will find the job that they want. For example, when Johnny did multiple activities in school, he knew that he wanted to be an artist because he liked to draw and he was good at it. Also, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then they will make can make lots of money. For instance, Jared wanted to be a computer programmer and make lots of money so he joined a club about computers. In conclusion, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then students will live happier life.\n \n Students should at least take one extracurricular activity because students will get healthier if they join a sports team.

        "Imagian getting home from school at around five and then doing homework till like seven or eight sounds crazy right well thats what will happen if students are fourced to do an extracurricular activity. Us students simply wouldn't have time for anything else which is why I disagree with making students dp a curricular activity. Some of us students just don't have the time and are far to busy with things like getting home late, doing homework or studing, plus some kids babysit.\n \n The first reason I disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. Parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. Plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.\n \n The second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. If you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. This will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. Which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.\n \n The third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin. However, with an after school activity they will not return home in time to watch said family members. And lets not forget that some students have jobs as babysitters for other people's kids.\n \n Now I understand that some people may say \"\"oh but it's good for young children to do an after school activity and I agree, however some students are far to busy and should not be fourced to do an after school activity its not that we're lazy or anything we'er just to busy.\n \n so in conclution i believe students should not be fourced into an extracurricular activity some of us are truely to busy for one being that we will get home late, have to much homework, and no time for friends, along with watching younger family members there is no time",

Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after schoolÂ students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.\n \n Extracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to. The student may feel the need to attend every single meeting which may also cause stress or anxiety. There are two more reasons that an extracurricular activity should not be required.\n \n Students may not like any extracurricular activity that was offered. There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list. If the student does not like any extracurricular activity they should not be forced into one. Forcing a student into an activity they do not want to do could be stressful on them or result in a violent reaction.Â There is a final reason why extracurricular activities should not be required.\n \n Students may not have the time for an extracurricular activity if it is after school. Some students have things going on as soon as they get home, it could be another sport that is not in school or just going out after school. A lot of people usually don't have time for an activity that is after school if they are already in a sport that is not at the school.

        "After-school activities offer a variety of things, and students often choose to stay after school to enjoy them. However, being forced to stay past school hours to participate wouldn't be much fun for something that's supposed to be an activity to enjoy in your free time. Students should not have to participate in after-school activities, because some students may have other matters they need to attend to (family, jobs, etc), may already be doing a time-consuming activityÂ outside of school, or may not have transportation home.\n \n Students may already have things to do that take up after-school time: for example, they could be needed to babysit younger siblings, to take care of another family member, to do household chores, or to work an after-school job. Requiring students to do an after-school activity would take up this time, where they might be really needed.\n \n Having students participate in things beside schoolwork is important, but not more important than family or work needs. They might be leaving a younger child alone, just because they have to participate inÂ a sport or student council. There are things more important than extracurricular activities.\n \n Students may also have an outside-of-school activity to participate in at the time. Many students choose to take lessons or sports outside of school. For example, they might have private instrument lessons, a neighborhood science club, or a sport team that isn't school-involved. These activities are just as important as school ones, and they shouldn't be forced to miss them because of requiring extracurricular clubs. The outside-of-school activities are often paid for, or require money in some way. This would lead to a loss of money for the parents, paying for lessons that the students can't attend.Â Students may lead busy lives, and they shouldn'tÂ have to have them taken up by even more school-required things.\n \n Another reason school clubs shouldnt be enforced is that while buses and parent pick-up are often available at the end of the school day, it is not always the same when it's already been an hour after school. Parents also often have busy schedules, and they can't always be available to drive their student home. That is one reason why some students choose not to participateÂ in extracurricular activities. But ifÂ studentsÂ are being forced to stay after school, they might not have a ride home. This would create a problem, because then most of the school would need a bus ride home, and that would require a lot of buses and bus drivers. This would be very financially taxing for the school, so it would be better to just let students go home at the end of the school day. They have already been required to attend school for seven hours; it would not be fair to make them stay longer for something that isn't even education-related.\n \n In summary, students have busy lives already, taken up by chores, family commitments, possible after-school jobs, schoolwork, and outside-of-school activities. They shouldn't be forced to add more things to their schedule. Extracurricular activities are meant to something fun and enjoyable in a student's free time, a choice to partake in something they find interesting. Making students attend extracurricularÂ activities would take the fun out of it - it's supposed to a chance students can take, not another thing forced upon them. These students have lives to live, things to take care of, other time-consuming responsibilities in life that are more important than school-related ones. Let extracurricular activities remain as a choice for students.",

        "This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.\n \n Most students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.\n \n Students tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.\n \n We all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.\n \n Principals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things about doing a sport after school. You should go out and try for any sport you can and you can get better and better everyday. Nobody is holding you back from doing something you want to try doing.",

        "Why do nothing, when you can do something that will help you no and in your future?\n \n Students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity.\n \n The principle's choice to have every student to do an extracurricular activity is a good choice because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, Students get to meet kids that they normally wouldn't meet just in school, and students will get an example on what it is like to work with a team or group.\n \n First, it is good for students to participate in one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests.\n \n People that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.\n \n You hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.\n \n But, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.\n \n The people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.\n \n For example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.\n \n The student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.\n \n Then eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.\n \n Finally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group.\n \n Next, it would be good for students to do an extracurricular activity because they will get to meet people that they normally wouldn't meet when you are in school.\n \n Joining a team or group will be nerve racking at first because you might not know anyone that share the same interests as you do.\n \n But when the team/group finally gets to talking, they will have bonded so that nobody could break them apart.\n \n It is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.\n \n In school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.\n \n But when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.\n \n People that you once thought were \"\"weird\"\", or \"\"annoying,\"\" are now your friends because you realized that they actually have the same personality that you do.\n \n Finally, it is important to do at least one extracurricular activity because students will get a taste of the real world in having to work as a team to get things done.\n \n If students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.\n \n Learning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.\n \n So the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.\n \n If you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.\n \n Nobody will hire you because they will look at your back roundÂ and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.\n \n Nobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.\n \n Finally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.\n \n Most people don't want that, do you?\n \n In conclusion, it would be smart for the principle to implement that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others that have their same interests, students will get to meet other students that they wouldn't normally meet in normal school time, and the students will get an example on what it is like to work as a team and to prosper at doing your work.\n \n Starting with an extracurricular activity now will not only help you now, but it will help you later in life too.

        "Getting the kids to do things in school like different activities and things could help them so much and also have fun with school.\n \n Can you imagine going to school and being able to do other things besides learn? Going to school and getting to play sports during school can help with so many things in life. Going to school and playing sports like basketball, football and soccer and etc, playing those sports during school hours could be fun for the students. For the ones that love to play sports could have so much fun. Playing the sports you like can be fun but also can make you better at the things you do, it is like giving you practice outside of practicing with your team. Kids now in days need to at least do something active everyday. So therefore kids should at least be active of doing something for at least 60 minutes. So it is great to have kids participate in sports in school.\n \n Kids working around schools with technology is also being active in a way. Yearbook is an example of being active and also doing activities. Doing a activity that involves technology can make sure kids can learn things with the things that they are working with in school. Most students prefer using technology anyways so it should also be fun. Technology has games and writing and reading and etc. Those things can help kids have fun but also learn things at the same time. Kids do need to read and write but they can also try to have fun with it if teachers added activities to it. Another thing that can help the students in school is to have at least at 3 min break but also use there technology at the time. These are examples on why students should have technology also as a activity during school.\n \n School could in viseÂ you to do better with things in life, or become the things that you would like to be some day. Helping around at school, could help the teachers out or help the kids become something the want to become. Working with teachers and other students is a great way of participating in school. When you are participating you are also learning new things. Participating is a good way for students to be active.\n \n Kids should participate in things more in school. Participating in sports is a great idea during school. However, technology is an activity that student's could work on. It is also a better way to have students learn. Also the school could always have students help out with teachers and things. This is why i think it is better to have student to participate in school with sports and different activities.Â",

        "School can often be full of work piling up in the classes we don't enjoy, and stress that gets us down. What if there was a way to make school enjoyable for everyone? Extracurricular activities are teams, clubs, and any other organization run by the school. Many students like these because they have something to look forward to while in school, but not everyone always joins. I believe that students should become a part of organizations because it gives them a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and choose an activity that they enjoy.\n \n In school activities that are outside of class, students have a chance to create bonds with new people. Teams and clubs require working together to make ideas come along, especially student council and sports. This also builds a work ethic for future jobs. Sometimes students may have trouble making friends, so being in a club makes it easy to meet people. Similar interests can also often lead to friendships. Students can also get to know a teacher who sponsors their club better, as many students rarely speak with them in class. Having a more interesting topic to discuss with teachers helps students feel more comfortable around them in class.\n \n Students should become more involved in schools activities. As a yearbook staff member, I know that from experience. I have been able to go onto the basketball courts during pep rallies to get pictures, inform people and work with them about buying a yearbook, and learn about other class when I take pictures and collect information from them. Similarly to student government, students are able to see their hard work pay off when fellow classmates participate in spirit days and other events. With sports, athletes are able to show off their skill and passion for the game while being able to represent their school.\n \n Lastly students are able to choose what they want to be a part of. Not everyone enjoys the problem solving of math or the memorization of history, but it is a requirement to take them. If students join an activity they'll enjoy, then they will have something to look forward to in school. This can also strengthen career paths. If a student is set on becoming a business leader, they can be a part of yearbook or the other organizations that run like a business. If a student is determined to be in the NFL, then they can tryout for the football team. And if they don't find a fit for them, they should be able to make a group themselves. It's important to have a variety of clubs, including students' ideas.\n \n In conclusion, schools should require their students to join extracurriculars just as they require them to take core classes. This is because it gives students a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and be a part of something that they would enjoy.\n \n Students shouldn't dread school, and this is one way to make it better.Â",

        "Students should participate In at least one extracurricular activity. Children should participate in extracurricular activities because it wouldÂ help them in the future, it is also is a great way for students to connect with new people that like the same thing.\n \n Students participating in extracurricular activities could help them in the future. Collages like good grades but you would have a stronger resume if you did sports,or worked with the student council. Most collages are looking for someone that can do a variety of activities, doing clubs and sports shows them you have what it takes. Many adults have health problems due to the fact that they are not in shape and a great extracurricular activity is sports so starting at a young age will decrease you chances of having bad health problems. Sports are also fun to do, there are different varieties to choose from like soccer basketball,and dance. Clubs and sports can help you in real life situations. When you are older and start to have jobs, situations will come up when you have to work with other people and you have to be able to know how to lead. This is why extracurricular activities will help you in the future.\n \n Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people and connect with others like you. In real life situations you want to know how to be able to talk to other people and the clubs and sports you join are great practice. When you are older and you have to try to impress people it will not come off like you are nervous because you have had practice. As you grow older you will not have school to make friends so you have to learn how to talk with people so you can connect and make potential life long friends. After school clubs and activities can help you with theses types of situations.\n \n People might argueÂ that some students might not have their parents to take them home or have enough money for sports. Most schools provide after school buses so you can go home. This can be a very big help for parents because they will be coming home from work around that time and knowing that their child is safe a school will take some stress off of them. After school schedule usually line up better with work than a regular school day. Money shouldnt be and issue because school do these activities for free, but if something does come up where you have to pay than you could set something up with the school that will work for you and your family. Theses reasons state why extracurricular activities would be good for you.\n \n This is why I think student should participate in at least oneÂ extracurricular activity because it would help them in the future and and they can connect with new people and make new friends.

        "Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.\n \n Having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.\n \n For example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.\n \n Forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.\n \n Forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.",

        'Nine times out of ten children will get bad habits from not adding an extracurricular activity to their schedule.\n \n Causing them to be lazy and end up with bad grades. Because when you add at least one or more extracurricular activity to your schedule, it can help you be more social, get ready for highÂ school, and have a healthier schedule.\n \n First, is being more social. When getting a new activity to do at the end of the day, you will end up with other people. Meeting different people is one of the ways to clear bad social habits. Because of the fact that they are in the same activity as you, some of them might have the same interests. This can cause you to have new friends, this will help you work with others. Working with others is a good factor when you have an extracurricular, and it\'s not as hard as opinions might think. Working with others has a bad side to it because of this you could get annoyed, but you can get use to it by building tolerance .\n \n The second reason is, that it helps you get ready for high school. To get ready for high school you are going to need a good GPA score meaning you need a high grade if not higher. Getting an extra activity can help you if not guide you to the higher GPA. Sometimes the teachers will give you extra credit activities or let you finish work that you want to get done.\n \n The thirdÂ and final reason is building a healthy schedule. Building a healthy schedule is very important because it can effect what you do now and what you will do in the future. When you add something to your schedule it will help you be able to take hard and stressful tasks. This will help you when ever you dont have a lot of people around to help.\n \n Now some people might say that it\'s ""too hard"",""I just dont need it"" , or "" it takes too much time"". But student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. This counter argument dose not compute with what is needed.\n \n If adding an extra curricular activity to a students time, then it will give them social skills, lead them to high school, and help build a healthy schedule. These are the main things that students need to be successful.',

        "What ! The principleÂ is making us participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I remember when I was forced as a kid to do that, I didnt like it at all. I disagree with this statement because, first off some students might not have time to do the extra activity's, secondly the students work hard enough as it is in school, lastly it might be the least favorite thing they do especially if they have to get forced into participating in extracurricular.\n \n Well to start, some students can't stay after, they might need to go home and babysit or watch out for their siblings. Secondly, some kids might have hours of homework that they need to do, they might not have time for extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have after school sports like baseball or football games and they would like to attend to instead of playing or doing something after hours that doesnt matter as much as students sport.\n \n Next, students work all through out the day with hardly any breaks, students want a break from having to deal with taking down notes and hearing a teacher talk for hours. Secondly, lot's of students are stressed out with grades and family problems, so why make them more stressed out by forcing them to do extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have to follow the rules and listen to teachers daily, as a result the students wont be able to learn when to make decisions for them selves if they the teachers are always telling them what to do. Students need to know when to make the decision to stay or not stay, not to be forced.\n \n Lastly, some kids dont like to do extra things like playing games or sports at school because it will make them very sweaty and sticky, the principle is also forcing them to stay. An addition, since the principle is not giving the students a choice they wont like it, but If there was a option that the kids could choose then it would be more enjoyable because they can choose when they want to stay or not stay. Lastly most students like to kick back and relax and spend some time inside their home. I personally would like to be home sometimes after school and watch some movies and fall asleep if I can.\n \n In conclusion, I disagree with with this statement because, it's not fair for a student to be forced into staying after to do extracurricular activities. It's also not right to be forced to stay, especially if a student had to take care of personal business like taking care of family. Principles should already know what could go on at a house, so they need to be more reasonable when it comes toÂ adding on to a persons schedule. I still cant believe that the principle is making everyone stay and participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Â Â",

        "Your principal has decided that students are required to take at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree with this? I agree with this because you may want to stay interested in any of your schools activities. It is important because students want to stay active with there schools and the best way by doing that is by having something for students to experience. Schools have activities for students to do after schoolÂ because they want them to stay active. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students gain responsibility, helps get students motivated, benefit their college and job application.\n \n First things first, having extracurricular activities can help students gain responsibility because in some cases students will be doing things that take someone with responsibility to do. For example, students that are in sports are responsible for having the appropriate shoes and clothes for their practices. This is one reason why activities, that certain schools have, are important. This will motivate students to do better and they would want to succeed in whatever they are doing. This leads me to my second reason.\n \n Secondly, it could help students get motivated to do better in school. This is important because extracurricular activities require you to have good grades and if you like one of the activities you are doing you will be motivated to do good so that you can stay in it. This can allow tons of students to be successful in school and they will try hard in school. Students might want to do certain activities that require them to have good grades and if they don't then they can't do it. This is why in order to do what you like you need to do good in school and it is very important to do good in school.\n \n Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit you when you are trying to apply for a job or just trying to get into a college of your choice. The first thing is that it may help you look good when putting whatever you did on your paper. For example, someone can put they did track and then they got an award for winning a competition, that would make their paper look good. Another example is that if you want to get a specific job and you are in a certain club were they teach you about the job could really benefit you. Like stated in the previous paragraph, it could help you take care of your grades and if you do have good grades colleges would want you. This could help you in the long run because it is important to have some experience with what job you want. Extracurricular activities can help you get to know how you feel about this and if you want to do this in the future.\n \n In conclusion many students need to be responsible in order to keep the activity they want. Students will become motivated to do better so that they can stay in that certain activity. Students will have the experience and they will be able to get the job that they want. These reasons prove on why it is important to have extracurricular activities. This is why I agree on how students should be entitled to at least on activity because it helps students gain responsibility, helps students get students motivated, and it helps students on their job application and college application.

        "Haven'tÂ you ever been so tired to listening to a subject that you seem to dislike? Wanting a break but never able to since its for a grade, well your principal has decided that you can participate in an activity you might like! You can be in a sport, work on the yearbook, or even serve in the student council! I for sure love this idea! It helps kids look forward to something that might not be as tiring and boring as the subjects of schools, run around in basketball, be creative in art class, be inspirational as you work on the yearbook, or help others and the principals being a part of the student council! It all helps in the school system and you might make a change, for example, Generic_Name, a senior in one of the highest ranks high schoolÂ in Japan, was a student councilor that helped hundreds of students from doing a bad choice, grades, or just be someone to talk to. The principal has announcementÂ that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity, and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.\n \n First, it'll make you look forward about something during your day. You might have had a bad day but then you might remember that you're going to maybe you favorite topic class and that might brighten up you day a lot more. It'll be like a small break you get other then lunch. You get to talk with your friends and maybe even your favorite teacher and learn new tactics in the class you might like. A moment class where you can relax and hang out and get grade in too! A lot of high schools, if not all, let you pick the class you wanna be in and you may have other choices too. It's a matter of your and luck but always worth it.\n \n Second, I'll be talking about how you might socialize more. You might not get what I'mÂ saying so I'll just straight up say it, you don't always have to be quiet unless, of course, the teacher is talking. You get to be in groups and learn from each other and depending on what your doing you will get a different pack. For example, if you were to be in a basketball team, you going to see different cons and pros onÂ each player but you'll all will have toÂ work with each other to accomplish you goal, if your working on the yearbook you will all have to speak to each other and work on the same task to show that sometimes two people make a better job then one. It can help you boost up your social skills and your skills with working with others even if you've never met them. Socializing its a big stage in our life that some areÂ very afraid ofÂ and others not at all and this types of things will help you in case if you wanna make a business or be a doctor or police officer or anything, but communication is always the key that you wanna use.\n \n Thirdly, this class may be the best of each year your in high school, you never know. It can be that class you'll always talk to your friends about after you graduate and have memories of. The class that brightened up your whole high school year into one of the amazing years ever, the one class that when ever you pass your old high school or have to speak about it thats the fist thing that comes into mind. That one class that cleared you mind and helped you with drama and other skills you might have needed to learn.\n \n In conclusion,Â the principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity,and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.

        "Can you believe that schools are now making students stay after-school to participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with schools having students participate in one extracurricular activity becasuse students need time for other activities outside of school, students need time with their families, and they need time to do their homework.\n \n Many students love coming home right when the school bell rings and having the rest of the day to do what they like. This is not the case at some schools. At my school our principal is having us participate in one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because students need time to play and practice sports such as basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer. Students also need time to hang out with their friends not just inside of school, but outside too. If a student is forced to stay after-school and there is nothing they like there than it may bother the students emotions and make them sad. If a student is sad or upset about this it may affect their participation, attendence, and effort. I do not want kids spending more time than they have to at school.\n \n There are a ton of students who do not get to see their family at all due to school. Students need time to be with their family and socialize with them like playing a board game or having a nice conversation. Extracurricular activities may interfere with the time that kids have to spend with their families. It is very important that kids spend time with their families because it keeps their mental health well, keeps them in line, and provides comfort for them. It keeps their mental health stable because they do not worry about seeing their parents or when they will see their parents again. It keeps them in line because they have somebody to tell them what is ok and what is not ok and they have somebody to discipline them. It provides comfort for kids because they know somebody or some group of people are there for them. If students had no time to spend with their family it would most likely casue many problems for them.\n \n Did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen.\n \n Once again, I believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework. If time that students have for these activities gets taken away by school it may lead to something bad. If you do not agree with me please think about this again and if you do agree with me that is great because you are thinking the right way.",

        "Generic_Name is making the whole school participate in at leastÂ one after school sport. Although most kids arent happy with this i certainly am!\n \n I agree that you should participate in at least one activity after school because, its good exercise for you, its only one activity and its a break from watching TV all day and being on your phone.\n \n The first reason you should do an after school activity is because, its good exercise, doing an after school sport can make you a healthy person because of the constant movement and running you do in most sports. For example sumo wrestlers usually lose up to 30,000 calories a day which is insane isnt it. You dont know how much impact a sport has on your health. Another example of sports being good exercise for you is when your constantly at practice in you do drills like running or in ice hockey when you move around back and fourth, or when in wrestling your sprawling and consistently moving. Stuff like that is the best exercise you can get these days. Or even if its not a sport it can be exercise, when your just walking you are burning calories. everything you do burns calories, even breathing.\n \n Moving on to my second reason on why you should do an after school activity is because its only one activity you have to do. Its not like its for 3 hours everyday of the year. Its not a huge birdin you have to do, its probably only like an hour and 30 mins a day or less for only like a season. But if your that lazy just do something simple and easy that dosent last long at all. Then you'll get your one activity you have to do out of the way so you can spend the rest of your year after school how you would like. The only reason i see you can't stay after school for an activity is because your family needs you everyday after school, or you have a little brother to take care of, things like that. If anything it might motivate you to do more activities after school, or join a league outside of school. All ImÂ saying is its only a little bit of time out of your day so dont sweat it.\n \n My Finale reason why i agree you should do at leastÂ one after school activity is because it gets you away from your phone. Instead looking on instagram and checking out snap chat. Your in the real world doing something instead of posting a selfie for the internet. While your staying after school to do an activity some lazy guy at home is just playing video games in his basement which is not helping him out, or getting the exercise he needs. Plus one day your not gonna be able to do this. Your just gonna sit in a cubical all day working on stuff and doing papers from 9 am to 5 pm. But you seriously need this because you can't be on your phone or the internet for the rest of your life.\n \n In Conclusion i agree that we all should do one sport or activity after school because in reality its good exercise, dosent take that long and its better then looking at your phone. It wont kill you to do a sport and its not that hard. You'll be find doing an after school activity. Once the season is over for the sport your doing then your done, you've gotten it over withÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â",

After school students might can't do after school do to family problems, stressed, or just don't want to do those things. I also disagree because you can't force a person who dosen't want to do something you want them to do for after school.\n \n family problems, a lotÂ of student go through alot when it comes to family and just don't have the time because earthier something tradect happened or someone in there family died and thats hard on student when it comes to a family member dyeing or something bad happens. some students dont also have the time because there parent have to work and the student has to watch its brother or sister and just cant saty after school because of that. Student Can't stay after school because there parents need help around the house after school and sometimes they don't have a ride to get home or they don't have a bus to ride.\n \n After school a lotÂ of student are stressed because of school work, grades and homework. At school you sometimes a lotÂ of classes and you just get really stressed because you can't keep up with the school work. Grades are a big factor at school because without good grades you sometimes can't do the stuff you want to and the grade affects some of your stuff. homework some kids dont have the time to stay after school because they have a lotÂ of homework and sometimes home work affects your after school activities. Stressed is one of the biggest factors of not wanting to do after school.\n \n Some students are not good at a lotÂ of thing like sports, or clubs or they just dont like those things. Student shouldn't be forced to do something that they arent good at. sometimes they don't know what to do or they could get embarrassedÂ in frontÂ of the kid that are good at it. They could make fun of those kids and laugh at them because they are not good at it what they were forced too do after school.\n \n Conclusion- students should not have to do what they dont want to do after school because its just not right to force a student to do something they don't want to do after school",

        "Did you know that one out of every four schools don't let students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that this is unfair and students should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Imagine not being able to participate in many fun skill-learning activities.\n \n While others believe that participating in an extracurricular activity is a waste of time, I believe that it is not.\n \n I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity for reasons such as, it will make school a better place for students to be in, it will be a chance for students to make more friends or meet new people and kids will improve their skills or learn new skills.\n \n Extracurricular activities will make school a better place for students to attend. It will also encourage kids to want to go to school everyday because they will be looking forward to that one or more extracurricular activity. Many kids don't want to attend school everyday because they have so much things going on like homework, projects, tests etc. Extracurricular activities will help relief the stress many kids go through everyday, it will get their mind off all the things going on at home. When I was having a bad day at school, I always remembered that I was going to stay after schoolÂ for Art club that day and that cheered me up.\n \n Extracurricular activities will also be the chance for students to make friends and meet new people. It is most likely the kids you meet in that extracurricular activity will be interesting in the same thing as you are. For example if you meet someone that likes and plays the same sport as you, you guys will have something in common. One time I attended the Spanish Culture club and I met a lot of new people that I had in common with, everyone spoke Spanish and was from South America.\n \n Extracurricular activities will improve kids skills or teach them new skills. It is good for a kid to know many skills because it will help them later in life, it doesn't hurt to learn new skills or to improve them. When I joined my school's dance team I learned a lot of new skills, for example turns, jumps, new choreography etc. I also improved how flexible I was and how far I could do my splits. By the end of the school year I learned how to properly do my splits and also some jumps. Joining the dance team really helped me in a lot of ways.\n \n In conclusion, I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity for reasons such as it will make school a better environment and a better place in general, it will be a chance for students to make more friends and meet more people and kids will improve some previous skills they have or they will learn new skills.Â",

        "Imagine living in a world where you had to do every single activity. I disagree that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because not everybody has time to do activities. Most kids are still in school and get homework and have to study for test and can't ever do activities.\n \n Here are some of my reasons why I disagree. Parents have to work. See not all parents have the time to be driving there kid places if they're busy at home or at work. Some parents have to work late so they can have money. Parents have a lot of responsibilities.\n \n Reasons why we don't have time to do extracurricular activities is because they cost a lot of money. I used to do gymnastics when I was younger but I had to quit because my mom didn't always have the money to pay for it. I was so upset when I figured out I had to quit but I was strong because I can always do it again in the future. So sometimes our parents are struggling and we can't help but to quit. Just because our parents don't have time or money to do it now doesn't mean we can't do what we love in the future.\n \n Don't forget about us kids! We have tons of work to do at school and have to study and sometimes projects for school and its so overwhelming! If we have so much to do how could we ever to do an extracurricular activity! Doing extracurricular activities can also take up the time that you might just want to yourself. Some people don't even like doing activities which means they would but doing they're not happy doing and it's not fun to do something you don't like. These are my reasons why I don't think that all students need to do at least one extracurricular activity.",

        "You just got home from school and you relax for a while then you are going to study and do homework. But you are forced by your school to do a sport or be in the student council so now you have less time to study. I think that student should not have to do something outside of school if they don't want to like playing a sport or working on the year book.\n \n First being forced to work on something you don't want to do can put more stress on kids. Lets say if you are forced to play a sport and you have no athletic ability and you hate that sport with a passion it can make you miserable, you have to spend a lot of time with a sports team and that can really be bad if you don't like it. If a kid cant get his homework done because of something he is forced to do that can also put a lot of stress on kids not being able to get work done. If kids are forced to do something they hate it can really have a negative effect on them and their grades.\n \n Also having to do other stuff outside of school that you don't want to do can take away from them having fun and playing with friends. Many kids now don't get outside as much as kids used to, and having them trapped not being able to do what they want can take away from them being kids. Having kids not being able to hang out with friends can make them not as happy and they can lack good social skills. You can see that forcing kids to do stuff they shouldn't have to do is a bad thing, this can suck for the kids if they have to do this.\n \n However getting kids to do other stuff can help them get off there screens. Kids are playing video gamesÂ way too much these days and getting them a new activity can help get them off. Playing a sport could help kids loose weight and be more fit so they are not unhealthy. This can be good but, making a kid play a sport they don't want to do can make it so they don't try in the sport and don't give any effort because they don't like it. No one wants to play a sport they are not good at. This is why kids should not be forced to do something they don't need to do.\n \n Now you can see how making kids do something they don't need to do is bad. I think schools should not make kids do something school related that doesn't count towards grades. I hope schools don't do this and that kids can just be themselves.",

        "Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities are very important, not only to your health, but to your fututre. Colleges have started looking into extracurricular activities more now then before. Not to mention how much fun they can be.\nCollege is important. It helps set you up for your job and 'adult readiness', but first, you have to get into college. Applications are important, they are a main factor in getting into college, but I wouldn't neccesarily call it your 'make or break'. Grades are exceedingly important when applying for college, but extracurricular activities are just as important. Extracurricular activities can help show that you can commit to something, follow through with it, and you might be very good at it. The more extracurricular activities, the better. For example, let's say an A average student who did no extracurricular activities applies for a college. Another B average student who did one or two extracurricular activities applies for the same college. The B average student is more likely to make it into the college than the A\naverage student because of their extracurricular activities.\nExtracurricular activities can mean many things. It can mean sports, clubs, volunteering, and many more. Sports are well-known to be good for your health. It helps you exercise and stay in good shape. Laziness, especial in teenagers nowadays, is very common. Being required to move and exercise would do our health and body good. Even if we don't do a sport and we chose a club. Clubs normally make you exercise your brain and make you think in a different way than school usually requires you to.\nFinally, it can be fun! Many people who do extracurricular activites found that they liked a certain activity more than others. I, for one, have that expieriance. I tried many sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, swimming, and ballet. I thouroughly enjoyed swimming, baseball, and ballet. However, I didn't do baseball. Now, I'm on pointe in my ballet and going on to my eleventh year of dance and my summer swim team was the Division and Finals champions. I love my extracurricular activities and I feel as though my life would be fairly boring without them.\nThere are so many benefits in doing extracurricular activities and being required to participate is merely helping you get the leg up on your future. In the end, it's all worth it, every bit. It does so much good in your life that you won't even relise it until your older. Therefore, I agree and support the principal in their decision.",

        "If you had to participate in an extracurricular activity, what would you choose to do? You have to pick because the principal said all of the students in the school have to participate. You may have reasons to not do it, but there are some reasons why you should. The main reason is you might actually like it and enjoy whatever activity you choose. So,Â I agree because some people may need the extra activity, others might wanna be more active, and some people may just wanna have fun.\nSome students may need an extra activity. One reason is they may want to be more confident or build their self-esteem. They might want to step out of their comfort zone, and also may be trying to impress someone. The person might also need help with something important to them. They may be struggling education wise and are searching for help. They might need help with a sport or hobby of theirs.\nStudents may be trying to be more active. They might be trying to get and stay fit. This student might want to become a stronger person than before. This person might want to get abs or build up stamina. It might be a goal for them to be a healthier person. It'll be better for their body in general. They'll be able to last longer while stretching and running.\nMost importantly, students simply just want to have fun. Students want to learn something new and exciting. They might want to learn how to play certain sports or games. They just want to have a good time playing together. They might want to play against other teams. The thrill of racing against time trying to get more points is amazing! It's also rewarding to have a victory in something.\nBased on those reasons, I see the point of having students be involved in an extracurricular activity. It's important and you could have some fun while doing so. It's not a punishment, it's probably to make sure you're getting energy, learning something new, playing a sport, or joining a club. Since you could have fun, may need the extra activity, and you may want to be more active, I agree with this decision.",

        "Hello my name is Generic_Name. I am here because I am giving my opinion on whether students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity. I think that it would be good for students in many ways, so keep reading if you want to find out why.\nForcing students to join extracurricular activities is a good idea, one reason is that they might make new friends. This could happen because they would find other kids in they're group who enjoy the same things. Having friends makes school a lotÂ easier and more fun. An extra bonus to having friends is that it is less likely for you to get bullied because you will have people to back you up. Even outside of school having friends is good. Like if you want to play basketball but you arent on a team, well boom! you could go to a court with your friends to run some games. In many ways having friends around will impact your life in good ways.\nAnother good reason for having to do activities is you could find out that your really good at something. Like, what if you could play a mean harmonica without even knowing it? You wouldn't have a clue unless you signed up for an extra activity. You might even be a good chess player. Im pretty good at chess and I wouldnt have known that unless I played a quick game with a friend. You could even make new friends with your newly discovered skills. Some activities can help you later in life, like if you need to knit a rope because you got lost in a forest, or you need to know how to jump start a car because it broke down on the side of the road, well no problem you already know how to do it because of the activity.\nYou could have a lot of fun doing some activities. Having fun is important because you dont want to have suicidal thoughts or depression. Being depressed could easily lead to bad grades and poor choices. Having fun is good because your life will just be better. You can do tons of things to have fun or be happy. Maybe your fun is reading, well then you could sign up for a book club. I have fun playing sports like basketball, or baseball. I like getting fresh air, so I play outside a lot. Again, having fun is so important it makes you want to try more things. Having fun can make people like you more so it could lead to you getting more friends, and having friends is also very important.\nOK! I have given my opinion on why every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities. I definitely think it would help out tons of kids to do it. So we should start as soon as possible. well its time to wrap things up. It was nice writing to you. this was more fun than I thought. See you later, bye!",

Not many parents have the time or money to put their kids in such either, and its also putting more stress on kids during and after school if having to join one.\nWhen being forced to do something such as a sport or school activity the school has to find a variety of the kids liking. Making sure all the kids in his school have a place to have fun at and not just something they have to do and dont enjoy. Having all kids in something at a school can cause running into dept because thats a lotÂ of kids you have to put money towards. Sports can run as much as two to a hundred dollars per kid for any sport, and when having to be forced into a sport that you dont enjoy why waist money. Even when the kids dont want to participate why even try putting your hard working money towards it.\nSports and activities for school are not free. The school has to buy equipment and tools for those opportunities and, sometimes not all parents can physically do that. Sports are a lotÂ of money and when having to be put into one not knowing how you are going to pay for it can be embarrassing. Letting your kid down is the least a father or mother would ever want to do, and when working in the school board having to deal with phone callsÂ from parents saying they cant afford a extracurricular activity would be heartbreaking.\nKids work really hard to put forth effort on school work,homework, and participate in school projects. That can be already enough stress on a kid no matter what age. When having to put another thing on top of school work managing time for sports, and extra activities sometimes kids just cant deal with it. Grades and having a good GPA can come first for some kids. Sports and other things come last. You could probrobaly already have something after school you do and having to move your whole schedule around can be really tiring and stressful.\nThis is why I disagree on having to make kids participate in a sport or activity. Its way to much work, stress, and money. So when coming down to a decisionÂ I agree with a no because having every kid in a sport or activity is absurd.Â",

        "My principle has decided that she wants everyone to participate in a extracurricular activity. In my opinion, I believe it's the best for students to participate in school activity. It will be a great way to have fun, make new friends, and get some exercise.\nMaking new friends is not always easy. Many kids now judge you by the way you dress, act or even look. For example, I was a new girl at a school. It wasn't very easy to make any friends so I decided to stay after school and join a club. As I was joining a club, I got paired up with a girl who was in the same grade as me.\nAt first, it was awkward but then we started conversations and we found many things in common. One thing that we found in common was that we both love dancing. Since then, we have been very close friends until this day. Participating in a activity was the best thing I did to be able to make new friends from a new school.\nAnother reason why students should join a activity is to maintain your health. According to WWW.stay. healthy. com, has stated that participating in a club or activity at least an hour per day is very important for your health. It is also a great way to distract yourself from any anxiety or stress you are facing. Everyday my sister would come home from school. She would always be overwhelmed with the amount of homework she had to do and complain about how much her neck and back was hurting. It was a hard time she was facing and my mom decided to take her to the doctors. Our Doctor, said that her body was hurting because she didn't get any excersice and she also wasn't participating in any activity to distract her. The next day, my sister decided to try out for volleyball. She was great and made the team. By joining volleyball, it helped her feel free because she was distracted by everything negative she was facing.\nJoining a activity doesn't have to be boring or all about running . Activities are meant for you to pick them and do something fun you love. There are many activities to choose from. For example, I love doing pottery. My mom and I would go to a building where they would teach you how to make cups, any animal, and vases. It makes your hands messy but it was so much fun. Next year, for high school there is a class where anyone can take and it is called ceramics. I am beyond excited to take a class where I'm going to do something that will distract me but at the same time I will be doing something that is fun for me. When given the chance to participate in any activity, it is a great way to pick something you know will be enjoyable.\nAs a result, by participating in a activity it helps you maintain your health, have fun, and meet new people. At first, starting something new can take a couple tries until you get it right. In addition, once you learn it is the best feeling ever to accomplish something new. After learning it will become easy and fun because you will already know what to do.\nIt is also a great way to meet new people and make friends who love the same thing you do. Activities help you feel distracted and calm because you are doing something you love and no one is judging you from it. These are my reasons on why I strongly believe that everyone should participate in a extracurricular activity.",

        "Some people might think after school actives are fun and some think not. Some principals think it is required for students to have an after school activity without thinking about how the students feel about after school actives. Students should have the right to choose weather to have and after school activity or not. Students should not have to participate in a extracurciuar activity after school because some students do not have the time, Not a student would like to be forced to do a after school activity, And not all students like to have an after school activity.\nAfter a long day at school some students do not have the time to do an after school activity. They could have after school plans and can not do the activity they were supposed to do. Others have lots of homework to do after school although teachers say that would be a terrible excuse to say but every teacher does not know how much homework the kids have after they're class. Students after school might have to take care of a younger sibling or pet because their mother or father is at work or they could be doing something to help out their mother or father.\nIn many occasions students are force to do an after school activity chosen by the school district. Students are more likely to do the activity if they are to chose it instead of the school district. Because of the students disliking the activity they were assigned they would most likely to skip it and go on with they're day. so instead of forcing students to do an activity have options for them so they can pick for themselves.\nSome students just do not like after schoolÂ actives and they do not have a reason why they just don't. The students would rather study for and up coming test or quiz. They are stay at home kids they go to school and come back home to do whatever they need to do to pass school. Their is no explanation but they just dislike actives after school and if they do not like it then they should not be force to do something they do not want to do. they want to take the time to study and pass the grade instead of doing an after school activity.\nAfter school actives can be every difficult to do for some students because some dont have the time, they would not like to be forced to do it,and some kids just do not like it at all. These are just some reasons on why not give after school actives to students but there are many more, people just do not think about how busy the life of a student is.Â",

We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future.\nSo if you don't agree with me, I'll give more reasons like kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friendsÂ while they're after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high schoolÂ sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.\nIt is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did.\nIf your not interested in sports you could do other afters schoolÂ activities like\nBook club\nYearbook club\nDance club\nCooking club\nComputer club\nStudent council\nEngineering club\nYou could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home.\nBut if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.\nIf you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit theÂ teacherÂ you will get expelled.\nIf your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.\nIf you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friendÂ over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend throughÂ basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.\nMost likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no oneÂ knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.\nSo what we know is that joining an after schoolÂ program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could joinÂ for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Imagine that you have a job after school, right after school goes out. But your school now requires you to take an extracurricular activity. You get fired from that job and all because of your school. This is what would happen to many people if schools mandated after school activities. I pick up my brother from his bus stop every day and if I had after school activities there would be no-one to pick him up. I think schools should not force students to take an extracurricular because of Jobs, People, and Time.\nOne of the reasons schools should not force students to take an extracurricular is Jobs. Some students have jobs after school. They might have to work to help support their family. If you made them take after school activities then they wont be able to make it to work on time most of the time and get fired. Nothing good would come of that situation.\nAnother reason is people like friends or family. As I said before, I pick my brother up from his bus stop every day. I also have friends that need to do the same thing. My mom has to go to work and my dad works from home so I'm the only one that can pick him up all the time. Same thing with my friend who also picks his brother up every day. If either of us had to do an extracurricular we wouldnt be able to pick up our siblings. Students also have plans after school with their friends, or maybe they are going on a trip with family. If they where forced into anÂ extracurricularÂ they would not have as much time to hang out with their friends or go places with family. They might be late to wherever they were going.\nThe last reason is time.Â Some students just simply dont have enough time every day to do an extracurricular. They might have clubs after school, or they might play on a sports team. Not everyone has that much free time after school. They have homework, eat, spend time on hobbies, etc. But an extracurricular takes another couple hours out of your day, thats less time to do all those things.\nThere are also arguments for students being forced into an extracurricular but I feel like students should have a choice because everyone is under different circumstances.\nCard Stacking\nWhether you have a job, a sibling to pick up, or plans with friends, you could be stopped from doing any of those things by the mandating of extracurricular activities.\nCall to Action\nSo next time you have a chance to influence a decision about this topic, make sure you make it so that there are no forced after school activities.\nRestate Thesis\nThat's why I think you should not make students take extracurricular.",

        "Have you ever struggled in a certain activity, or just wanted to join a new club.\nMany students often feel that way and don't know what to do, but there are many after school clubs that help out in that regard. Students who are struggling in certain subject could stay after school with a teacher to help in that situation. Many schools also provide sport clubs so that students interested would join, and possible lend them a scholarship into collage. Students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to make stronger bonds with others. With so many benefits to staying after school, I believe that students should stay after school in at least one club.\nThere are many instances in which students struggle to keep high grades up, and don't know what to do. There are many extracurricular activities that may help in that scenario. Students can find clubs in which they can get help by teachers to do work there struggling to finish.\nIf a student missed a day of school and can't catch up, teachers can stay after and show them and important information that they missed. Tests can bring stress to students , and even make them panic a little, when that happens students can request thatÂ teacher help them and even give tips on how to relax and focus. Trying to juggle so many things at once can be difficult for most students, but teachers are there to help out those in need.\nSport clubs are one of the most popular clubs in some schools, and for good reason. Clubs like these offer students a chance to play the sport they like and represent the school at the same time. Sport clubs also give participantsÂ the opportunity to hang out with friends and create new ones along the way. In some rare chances collages may offer them a fully paid scholarship if they see the student overall success, and while it even rarer some professionals may be interested and ask them to join there team. Sports clubs offer students many opportunitiesÂ to get a head start in life and even get them interested in new hobbies.\nStudents coming to a new school for the first time might be timid or feel alone during the first few day, so why not ask them to come to after school. Extracurricular activities offer new students the change to make new friends and even help strengthen old ones. Many group of friends often hang out after school to just hang out or relax from the stressful day. Many clubs also relate to specific peoples interest, so people can meet others who are interested in their hobbies. Every person is unique and some may struggle to make new bonds, but after school activities can help them meet people who share the same hobbies or help steanthen bonds\nAfter school clubs are some of the key factors in schools. They help them keep high grades, Gives students the chance to do there hobbies like sport, and may even help new kids to make bonds or steanthen them.

        '""Mom,"" Generic_Name whimpered sadly. ""Why is it so hard to make friends in school?"" Her mother moves slowly towards the edge of her daughters bed and grabs her hand. ""Now sweetie,"" her mother says comfortingly. ""I\'m sure if you tried hard enough you could make friends with someone."" Crying softly Generic_Name turns toward her mother and says angrily, ""It\'s not that easy mom! I don\'t have anything to talk about with these people. We don\'t even like the same things!"" sighing her mother pulls her in for a hug, ""oh honey, I\'m so sorry. I had no idea."" Generic_Name\'s mother can\'t do anything but rock her sobbing child as she cries .\nThis is a sad reality for many kids, throughout all stages of schooling, they have difficulties making friends and often end up feeling isolated and lonely. This problem can be easily solved by school principals requiring students participate in at least one extracurricular activity like a club or a sport. These extracurricular activities would help encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue a passion or hobby, and give each otherÂ opportunities to learn more about themselves while expressing their personal interests and talents.\nThe first reason schools should make extracurricular activities a requirement is because they would encourage students to be more social with their peers. As a student with social anxiety I know how difficult it can be to try and talk to people and make friends, but in my experience i\'ve noticed that clubs and sports give students more confidence in themselves. An extracurricular activity, whether it be a sport or a club, is an 3 and easy way for a student to put them selfÂ out there with people who share their interests. For example when I first started school it was hard for me to talk to people and I didn\'t have many friends, then one day my language arts teacher encouraged me to try out for our school track team. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a chance, and it ended up being one of the smartest decisions I had made that year. After making the team I steadily came more and more out of my shell with the motivation of my teammates. I built strong friendships with many of the girls on my team solely because of the interest that bonded us together, our love for running. Joining track made me more confident in myself, and taught me how to make and maintain unbreakable friendships.\nMy second piece of reasoning as to why schools should require extracurricular activities, is because they would urge students to try new things and become interested in different hobbies. During the years students are in school, their hobbies are constantly evolving at a rapid pace, and they often become interested in things they had never acknowledged before. This example is true to many people, including myself. After track season had ended I decided I wanted to join an after schoolÂ club, but none of the options really caught my eye. After searching for awhile a friend from the track team asked if I would be interested in joining our school robotics club as her teammate. As I had no other options that jumped out to me, I decided to try joining. Since joining the club in my sixth grade year I\'ve developed a passion for engineering and computer programming that I never would have imagined developing otherwise. Taking that one chance to join the club has turned my previous skills and new ideas into a passion I doubt I\'ll ever lose.\nThe final reason that extracurricularÂ activities should be required is that being in a club or sport would assist students in discovering more about themselves. In many cases people find out new things about themselves while participating in a club. It could be simple things such as unknown talents, or as complicated as realizing their social position on a team. When I first joined robotics in my sixth grade year, I was what you would describe as a follower. But when our team captain was out because of a concussion and my team was falling apart, we found out that I was, as described by my coach, ""A natural born leader."" Even being the unsociable person I am, I was able to lead my team with no assistance for three weeks, with a strength I wasn\'t sure I had. After this discovery I was promoted by my coach to be a team captain. For the last three years I have been the captain of my team, and as this is my final year considering I\'m an eighth grader, my coach decided to test my skills. The past four months I have been captain and supervisor of three different teams by his order. I realize as I look back I never would have learned this about myself without joining robotics club.\n""MOM!"" Elise shouts excitedly as she rushes through the front door, ""WE WON!"" from her place in the kitchen her mother lets out a whoop of surprise before running to join her daughter in the living room. Surrounded by her teammates Elise holds the 1st place trophy up proudly as she laughs. The house is filled with the joyous laughter of Elise and her friends from the soccer club. As the girls chat between themselves Elise\'s mother looks on with a smile, proud of her daughter for finding friends that made her happy. Making eye contact with Elise she shouts, ""All right, Group picture!"" Lining up with large smiles on their faces and arms aroundÂ each other, the girls look into the camera with happiness evident on their faces. The snap of the camera ensures this memory will always have a special place in Elise\'s heart.\nWithout having joined an extracurricular activity Elise would never have had the opportunity to make the bonds and friendships she did. Being in a club or sport helps encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue new hobbies, and give each otherÂ opportunities to learn more about themselves and express their interests. Reasons such as these are why I agree that principles at all schools should make the decision requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Â Â Â',

Sports aren't the only option though, there are clubs like chess club, student council, yearbook or debate. This is a good chance for Generic_Name to make some friends. Many students don't do anything after school. If the students don't have an extracurricular activity then they seem less active with other people. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it keeps the students off their electronic devices, makes the students more active with others, and it helps the students to stay out of trouble.\nFirst, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it will keep the students off their electronic devices. People today are very absorbed in their devices. Apps like Instagram, TikÂ Tok, Facebook, and YouTube keep people entertained for hours. When students dont have an extracurricular activity then they are more likely to get on their devices for many hours. If students were to go to an extracurricular activity then they could be more involved in the real world and not crammed inside there house on their phone for hours.\nSecond, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it makes the students more active with other people. Many people struggle with interacting with others, but an extracurricular activity can help students to meet new people. Being in an extracurricular activity will help students to make new friends. Most of these activities require students to interact so they will have to make friends. Having friends in school makes their time there more enjoyable. Going out of the students comfort zone is a part of life they are going to have to do things that make them uncomfortable.\nLast, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it helps the students stay out of trouble. Students are more likely to get into trouble when the aren't in a extracurricular activity because, they may get bored and just go and make some bad decisions.

Push students to join these extracurricular activities so they can explore what they like to do, and what they dont like to do. If students never get out of their comfort zone then that wont get anywhere in life. Extracurricular activities are good for the students. It gives the students something to look forward to at the end of the day.Â",

        "Imagine yourself running down a basketball court to score a point for your team, winning a debate, taking the perfect picture for your school yearbook, or being the leader of a student council meeting. These scenarios are some activities that students participate in and find joy in doing. Many students try school related activities and result in being very passionate about them. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows them to learn life skills, help find a better activity they could enjoy, and make new friends.\nInvolving students in at least one extracurricular activity would allow them to learn new life skills. For example, if a student were to join Debate Team, they would learn how to properly debate against one another and find evidence to support their arguments. Another example would include sport activities. If a student were to take part in a sport at school, it would teach them about competition. When participating in sports many play to win and the game could get intense. This shows the players competitiveness. Also, if students were to serve in student council, they would learn how to be a leader. Students who are in student council participate in the meetings and come up with good ideas for the school. In life, this skill will be useful because it teaches students how to become a good leader. Students learn all kinds of different skills in extracurricular activities that could be useful later on in life.\nSome students have trouble finding activities they enjoy doing. However, there are many options to choose from when trying to find the right extracurricular activity. Within all of the choices, students could find one they are interested in. For example, when I was looking for a school related activity, it was easy to choose one that I would enjoy because there were so many options that interested me. I chose to run for student council and I have enjoyed my time as an officer. Additionally, many people try to figure out what they want to do in the future around their high school or middle school years. Participating in an extracurricular activity could help someone decide what they want their occupation to be because of an interest in an activity. To add, if a student is interested in one specific activity, they might want to join more that are similar since they share common interest. Finding one activity for a student could lead to them finding many new interests.\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity would also help students make new friends. For example, when doing a team activity, students learn teamwork. Most students find someone they work well with within a group of people and it could eventually turn into a friendship. Also, while working with a group, some people find others that share common interests with them. Most friendships work because they share similar interests in certain things. Additionally, activities are always more fun when you can do them with friends. For instance, when I play basketball independently, I am less motivated and I get bored faster. Whereas when I'm with my friends, my energy is higher and there's more to do. Overall, making new friends is always possible when doing an activity.\nTo conclude, taking part in at least one activity teaches you many different life skills without even knowing it, some students try one activity and find new interests along the way, and while working with others, students develop friendships. All of these advantages lead to a fun and educational experience.Â",

      essay:
        "Extracurricular activities, such as playing sports, instruments, and joining after school clubs are highly encouraged by adults and teachers for growing adolecents. Recently, the principal of the Generic_School stated all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe forcing students to join a club activity will be unnecessary, unproductive, and inefficient considering the cost and the effort. There is not enough data and evidence to ensure that all students will like their activities, it will create a fair cooperation and competition environment among diverse groups of students, and finally to prove that every student will enjoy extracurricular activities.\nMy first argument is that it will force students to participate in an activity that they might not enjoy which is unhealthy. My current school, Generic_School, does not have unlimited budget, faculty members, and space for different club activities. With very limited resources, the school will much prefer to establish more popular clubs than smaller clubs. Options that the school offer may not serve everyone's interest, but students will still need to choose an unappealing activity because it is mandotary. For example, when I was at a camp last summer, I was asked to choose five different activities. However, they did not offer all the courses I wanted and I ended up joining the swimming class which is my least favorite sport. From my own personal experience, I concern how some students might lose their interests or end up disliking their chosen clubs activities.\nSecondly, the plan seems unfair for certain group of students and will develop an unhealthy competition environment. It will simply create a disparity betweeen students who can afford private lessons or tutorings to get better at the activity and those who cannot. For example, a clarinet player who receives private lessons and plays in a local band will be able to perform much harder music and eventually be placed in a more advanced band than his peers who cannot afford the cost. This allows an environment where certain group of students will continue to get better and others cannot. Not only will it pressure the students with unnecessary stress, but it will also burden their parents financially.\nLastly and most importantly, it does not necessary have to be an extracurricular activity as far as the students are passionate about the activity. For example, some people might be passionate about learning foreign languages and cultures or solving creative math problems which are not considered extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are meant to help students find their hobbies and interests. However, for students who already have hobbies that are not necessary defined as an extracurricular activity, such as reading books or writing creative stories, it is not right to force them to do something that they are not interested in when they have already found their interests. Everyone is born with different talent and interest. For instance, I enjoy public speaking and joined the Generic_School Debate team, whereas others might fear giving speechs in front of their classmates during civics class. Extracurricular activities may not be the best option for all students.\nAlthough extracurricular activities are known to promote adolecents' overall well-being in general, there seems to be more disadvantages than benefits to this plan. Because the school board has limited resources to offer, it will be practically difficult to make extracurricular activities mandotary and ensure all students could benefit from this plan. We also cannot make sure that everyone will like the activities and create health and only necessary competition among the students. I value some benefits of this proposal but believe that it is more disadvantageous towards students and that is the reason why I disagree with this plan.Â Â",

        'Trudge,Trudge.\nGeneric_Name\'s feet dragged on the concrete as he sighed, walking into the school.Â The building towered over him while casting a gloomy, grayÂ shadow. As he entered the school, Generic_Name\'s so called ""friends"" ignored him and talked behind his back. He had known for a while that his friends hated him, but Generic_Name hadn\'t had the chance to gain better friends. The boys approached Generic_Name and start ranting about how stupid he was. This was the last straw. ""I\'m done with you guys!"" Generic_Name yelled, and stormed off. ""Fine with us,"" one of his old friends said. Now friendless and depressed,Â Generic_Name wished the school day could be over as he trudged off to his first class.\n""Alright class,"" Generic_Name\'s teacher said while students entered the room, ""Can anyone answer this question?"" No one made a sound. Everyone stared at the teacher pointing to the equation on the board. It was so quiet, you could hear the pin drop from Generic_Name\'s desk. Generic_Name knew the answer, but he was scared to answer. Generic_Name\'s teacher sighed. She said, ""Today we will start a group project. I\'ll assign groups. Remember to work together."" Generic_Name moaned and expected the worst. His group ended up being consisted of students that didn\'t know how to work together. They ended up arguing over everything ""What happened to \'teamwork\'?"" the teacher asked, startled. Generic_Name answered, ""Well if we had more opportunities to work with other people, we might know more about teamwork."" ""I better talk to the principal for more teamwork opportunities,"" Generic_Name\'s teacher said, shaking her head. I agree with the principal\'s decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make friends, increase self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.\nThe first reason why I support the decision of students participating in extra activities is that students can make friends. If students were able to join a club/activity of their choice, they would meet other people with similar interests, leading to new friends. For example, I have participated in the Generic_School Chamber Orchestra since 6th grade, and I met one of my current best friends at this club. I also have friends I met there that are at high school right now. I got closer to these people because I joined Chamber. All of us were advanced at playing an instrument, resulting in many similarities. Students with similar interests that join the same club usually have a lot of time to spend together, resulting in a friendship because they were able to connect for so long. A whole club could learn how fun it is to be around each other and even form a new friend group. I\'m sure Generic_Name could use a new friend group right now!\nThe second reason why I support the principal\'s decision is that students could develop better self confidence. Some people don\'t try out for a sport because they are too nervous about what other people would think about them. If it was mandatory for these students to join or tryout, they could make it and see how good/talented they actually are. This results in higher confidence. A shy and low-esteemed student being part of a club and making friends could finally see how funny they are, making them happier with higher confidence. For instance, I have a friend that I dance with that had a low self confidence. She started making friends, and now she is very outgoing. Maybe if the shy girls tried out for the cheerleadingÂ team, they would join and become a preppy cheerleader stereotype.\nThe final reason why I agree with the decision of students having to participate in at least one activity is that students would develop teamwork skills. People who play sports or participate in clubs know that teamwork is important. A basketball team that passes the ball to each other is more likely to score than a team with one person doing everything. If students were ""forced"" to join an activity, they would develop teamwork skills that would help them for group projects. It would even help them in the future for when they get a job. There are very few jobs now where teamwork isn\'t important because people need each other to complete a task. For example, it would be hard for a construction worker to build a whole house by himself. If the school made it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would help them with teamwork tremendously (especially Generic_Name).\nBounce, bounce.\nGeneric_Name practically skips into the school because he is so excited for Robotics. Ever since the principal made all students join an extracurricular activity, all students seemed to be happy to come to school. The building welcomed all students to a new school day. ""Hey Generic_Name!"" calls out Generic_Name\'s new friends. Generic_Name met them by joining Robotics. He runs to them and the whole Robotics team dives into conversation. ""I\'m so glad that I have such great friends that have similar interests as me,"" Generic_Name says cheerfully. Everyone laughs as they agree to walk to Robotics together. ""Hey everyone! Can anyone answer this question?"" Generic_Name\'s teacher asks while the students got settled in class. Everyone\'s hands shot up, including Generic_Name\'s. The teacher called on Generic_Name and he stated the right answer. ""Correct!"" the teacher said, and Generic_Name beamed. He was proud of himself and his new self confidence. He figured out how smart and funny he was after joining Robotics. He also figured out that he was great at math, and even led his team to victory at the Robotics Championship. ""Let\'s work on our projects!"" the teacher said. Generic_Name\'s group got together and they worked diligently for the rest of class. They each joined a club or sport, so they figured out teamwork. They worked together to produce an A+ worthy project. The teacher said, ""I\'m so proud that you guys figured out teamwork. The principal made a great decision!"" I agree with the principal\'s decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because they can make friends, gain self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.',

        "Many people have at least one activity that they love, care about, or are passionate about. School helps many kids find out their strengths and weaknesses. I believe that our school should make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. This will benefit students tremendously. If these activities can help students expand their social skills, get new opportunities, and let them have some fun at school, then I think our schools should have this requirement.\nFirst, we are going to talk about one of the reasons why the students should be required to be part of at least one extracurricular activity. That reason is sociability. If someone that is shy joins a club that they are interested in, they might talk more because they are in their element and where they feel the safest. Being in a club can also give kids the opportunity to make new friends. Students can learn social skills from working in groups within the club, or working with the whole club. Students might feel like they fit in more if they are in an activity where mostly everyone has a common interest. Depending on the club, there are multiple different ways that doing an extracurricular activity can help a student expand their social skills.\nNewÂ opportunitiesÂ and getting to explore different interests are a great benefit of doing an extracurricular activity. Students can learn about something they never knew existed. One time I was at a camp and they made us choose an activity that we wanted to try. I chose wood burning, and I had a learned a plethora of things that I did not know before. If the camp had never made me choose something to do, I would have never learned about wood burning. This very closely relates with the extracurricular activities. Students can get exposure to different types of activities, and may even find a new hobby that they enjoy. Next, we will talk about the third reason why I believe that we should make the activity mandatory.\nThe third reason why students should have to do an activity is so they can have fun. For many kids, school is work and stress. If they have a club to look forward to at the end of the day, it can make school more enjoyable, and maybe even more fun. It is also relaxing to have an activity that you get to do with your friends, and not worry about homework or tests. Some extracurricular activities may have fun projects or activities to do that students can enjoy. If a student is doing an activity that they enjoy or have an interest in, then it is likely that they will be having fun.\nHaving fun, learning new social skills, and exploring different clubs/activities are just some of the many reasons why our school should make extracurricular activities mandatory. These activities can lead students through a journey of self-discovery, and can benefit most of the students. I think it is the right choice to make all students do an extracurricular activity, and doing so will let kids enjoy some of the things that they care about and are passionate about.",

        "Generic_Name 3/05/20\nShould after school extracurriculars be required? How many days do you find yourself at home, wishing you were out playing football, but you didnt have a team, or needing help on your science homework, but your teacher wasn't there to help you? Extracurriculars can fix those problems becuase they offer after school sports, help from teachers, and many other fun activities. While they have many advantages, some students won't participate in fear they might not know anyone there, or because their friends aren't doing them. Schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can get you active, are socially beneficial, and can help you in school.\nThe first reason schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular is because it gets you active. Schools offer sports like basketball, football, and various other activities, and you can even be on a team! Being active is a very important factor in being healthy, and has many health benefits, like lowering risk of heart disease. After schools sports can also help you relax and have fun after a long day at school. School is seven hours long, and most of it is sitting and learning. After school, you can join sports clubs to get out all the energy you've been holding in all day, and have fun after all the stress of school. Sports and being active is also fun! You can do some simple layups, or play a whole game, it's up to you! Extracurricular sports clubs are helpful because they get you active and moving, have health benefits, and are enjoyable.\nAdditionally, after school clubs are socially beneficial. When you join a new club, you may not know everybody there, but you will make new friends. You will meet new, interesting people in after school clubs that you didn't know before. These new people could become some of your closest friends, and be super fun and cool to hang out with! You would already know something about them, which is a shared interest in the club you are both in. Meeting someone with similar interests helps to form friendships, and connections between people. You could also choose to do something with the friends you already have, like all joining a club and playing basketball together afterschool. After school clubs are socially beneficial because they help you meet new people, or hang out with close friends.\nFinally, extracurricular activities can help you out in school. You could stay after for a study group to help you prepare for a big test coming up, or simply to understand the material better. You could also stay after with a teacher for a class you may be struggling with. Other struggling students would be there too so you wouldn't be singled out, and all of you can learn together if you are having similar problems. After school study groups can also give you time to finish your homework, and get help or guidance if you need it. As well as homework, you can work on projects in school that maybe you don't have the materials for outside of school. If you have a big art project in progress, you could stay after in art to work on it, to really give it your all, and make it the best it can be. An extracurricular study group is very helpful to your education, and has many benefits.\nExtracurricular groups should be required because they are very beneficial to a students life. They help to get students active, social, and improve upon a students learing experience. I know that staying after school has helped me a lot. When I was struggling with a new unit in math I stayed after school to get some help from my teacher. After working on it for a little bit I could actually understand what I was learning. I wouldnt have understood it as well if I hadn't stayed for a study group to help me. I also know that i love sports, and staying after school for a sports club sounds like so much fun! Schools should require participation in at least one extracurricular activity because they increase your activity, benefit you socially, and help you in school.Â",

        "Think back to your middle and high school days where the biggest decision you had to make was what club you were going to participate in with your best friend. Was is required to join a club, or did you do it for fun and the experience? The majority of students participate in extracurricular activities to learn or practice certain skills they obtained in that activity. Although, this is not the case for everyone because there is still some students that do not engage in non-academic related activities because it isn't required.Â I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives them the opportunity to discover new activities, participate in something new and learn a set of social skills they will carry with themselves for the rest of their lives.\nThere is a very wide array of extracurricular activities to choose from, therefore you have more opportunities to discover something new. You might join a club or sport because your best friend is doing it or your parents told you to give it a try, and you could realize that the activity is something you really enjoy and are passionate about. Sometimes, people get hesitant to try new things, but what harm could be done? The worst thing that could happen is that you don't enjoy the activity and might have to try something different. Overall, joiningÂ an extracurricular activity is one of the best ways to learn about or discover something you truly enjoy.\nAll of the extracurricular activities you engage in should be things you enjoy doing because they take up a big part of your life and can sometimes act as the support you need to get through tough situations. Sometimes academics can be stressful, but that is where the activities that you enjoy come in. Especially as students get older, they tend to resort to their hobbies as a way to keep them calm. Extracurricular activities can also effect your academic performance and the other way around. This is shown a lot through sports because, most of the time, your grades affect whether you get to play or not. Additionally, participating in activities allows you to practice and show off your skills. Therefore participating in an activity can be beneficial to your life in multiple ways.\nHaving a set of social skills is crucial to your adult life, and one of the best ways to understand this is by doing an activity that helps you form those skills. Discipline, for example, is one of the main skills you learn, especially when participating in sports. There is other skills you learn as well that are applied more to your social life. Being around people that are passionate about the same activities you love creates friendships that can last you the rest of your life. Many people meet their greatest friends through participating in activities both of them enjoy. By joining a club or activity, you influence not only others, but yourself to work harder and accomplish your goals. For example, if you were on the soccer team, you might want to make it a goal to work out every day after school to make your stronger. Engaging in extracurricular activities creates additional skill sets that help your social life as a human.\nIn conclusion, participating in at least one extracurricular activity should be required for students because it not only allows them to explore new activities, but it benefits their academic and social skills. Although there can be conflicts with money and time that some students might not have, it is still important to give them the experiences they need to become vulnerable to success.Â",

        "Did you know their are some principals that make decisions that truly benefit the students in the long run. I agree with the principals decision toÂ make all students participate in a extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities, not only help with really important life skills, they provide an opportunity to make new friends and it helps students with their collage and job applications.\nExtracurricular activities help people learn important life skills and lessons. Their are some skills that can only be obtained by practicing and joining extracurricular activities. Skills like, public speaking, typing, writing and being organized are skills that people pick up from a lotÂ of practice and extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities dose not only teach skills it teachesÂ lessons. leaning lessons at an age where it is possible to understand what is being taught, helps those lessons be at the top of their head where it will never be forgotten. All the lessons and skills the people learn stick with them throughout their life time. When I was enrolled into an extracurricular activity by my parents, I learned the skill of how to keep thing neat an organized, and that skill has kept with meÂ ever since. That skill of being neat and organized helps me with finding work for my next class and keeping my locker very usable. Because of the skills and lessons I have learned from extracurricular activities, I agree with the principals decision.\nExtracurricular activities also provide an opportunity to make new friends and strengthen existing friendships.\nThe first time someone attends an extracurricular activity, they are usually bombarded with friendly faces everywhere they look. All of the people that show up to the class are bound to have a social interaction with someone they see. Their are certain extracurricular activities were everyone needs to talk with their peers. Activities like debate and soccer are examples were everyone needs to communicate to each other to ensure that they know what to do and what is happening. Extracurricular activities force people to spend time with each other. When I was enrolled for an extracurricular activity, all we did was work with each other on activities and working with other people enhanced my existing friendships and helped build new friendships. Extracurricular activities have impacted me in a way where without them I would not have meet some of my really good friends, and that is why I think all students should take at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\nExtracurricular activities help with collage and job applications. Extracurricular activities show people the amount of experience someone has. When someone is reviewing an application for a doctoring job for example, they look at how much experience the person has had in the field or on call. The extracurricular activity someone is in, not only helps with showing their experience, it gives that person a taste of what their applying too and it can boost their confidence. Those activities you participate in can also, instead of boosting their confidence, tell them that they might not actually like that activity and pursue a different one. I had always been interested in coding and couple of weeks after I had began I realized that coding was not for me and that I really enjoyed playing sports.\nThe extracurricular activities not only show your experience they also how your determination toward something.\nWhen someone signs up for extracurricular activity they are also sighing up for a course where they have to take out their own time and money for it which overall shows determination towards that activity. The amount of help the extracurricular activities give people is tremendousÂ compared to just learning by yourself and that is my thought process on why every student should be enrolled in to any sort of extracurricular activities.\nThe principal made a really good decision to make all of the students participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\nExtracurricular activities help people obtain certain skills and lessons that can only be provided from extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities also provides a platform to make new friend and enhance existing friendships. All extracurricular activities help show perseverance, determination and experience.\nAll factors like learning skills, making friends, and having experience, are reasons why I think the principal made a good decision.

        "Have you ever been forced to participate in something that you never wanted to have a part in? Well, this same situation will become a reality for many students at my school very soon. You see, Mrs. Generic_Name, the principal of my school, has decided that each student must participate in an extracurricular activity. This means that a student has to do an activity regardless if they want to or not. If students are required to do this, then they will not be able to complete their mandatoryÂ after schoolÂ obligations, spend precious time with their family, and they will have more stress added to their life.\nFirst off, since most extracurricular activities take place after school, students will not be able to complete their obligations waiting for them at home. For example, many students will no longer be able to watch their younger siblings until their parents return home from work. As a result, parents will need to find someone to watch their younger children. There are also quite a few students who have the responsibility of taking care of their family pets once they are finished with the school day. A few of the tasks that come with this responsibility are feeding the animals, taking them to the bathroom, and exercising them. Along with taking care of their younger siblings and their pets, students also need to complete their chores. So as you can see, it is extremely important that students are able to go straight home after school, instead of staying after for an extra hour or two, so they can fulfill these obligations.\nSecondly, participating in an extracurricular activity will pry into the limited and precious time that students are able to spend with their family. For example, most adolescents get home from school around four o'clock in the afternoon, and many of their parents get home around five in the afternoon. A majority of families eat dinner between five and six at night. Once you clean the kitchen up from dinner, that only leaves about four hours to spend with your family. Depending on when the students' activity takes place, that suspends the amount of time a family spends together to around three hours. That is hardly enough time to do anything together! A famous family counselor once said, \"\"Your child is a newborn for a month, an infant for a year, a toddler for two, an elementary schoolerÂ for six years, a preteen for three, and a teenager for five. Time is precious, so don't waste it.\"\" Children are at school more than they are at home. The more time that is added for school, the less time that is given for family.\nLastly, when students take on an extracurricular activity, they will have more stress added to their life. For example, if Generic_Name decided to write for the sports section of our school paper, he would need to go to every basketball, football, and baseball game. Then, he would need to write a detailed report about each of the games that he goes to. Since basketball games are every Monday, the football games are on Friday nights, and baseball games are on Saturdays and Sundays, Generic_Name would be writing at least four reports a week. That doesn't even include if any of the teams make it to the State Championships. If another student decided to join Drama, then he/she would need to attend at least seven weekday and two weekend practices a month, four dress rehearsals, and all five performances. Plus, the student would need to stay after each performance to help clean the set and put it back into order for the next night. Along with all this extra work of being in an extracurricular activity, students also have to complete their never ending work load from school. With all of this combined, there is enough stress to give these students severe health problems.\nIn conclusion, being required to take part in an extracurricular activity will result in students not being able to complete important after school obligations, losing precious time to spend with family, and having extra stress added to their life. Having the activities are a great idea, but the problem is that Mrs. Generic_Name is requiring them. If she allowed the activities to be optional, then families wouldn't have to find someone to watch their younger children, those who chose not to participate would be able to spend more time with their families, and there would be a lot less stress for the students to handle.Â From what you have read, I hope that you will agree with me and take a stance on my side against Mrs. Generic_Name's decision for participating in a mandatory, extracurricular activity.Â",

After school activity's can help keep you busy and out of trouble or it could help you bring your grades up if you are failing in one of your important classes that you are having trouble with learning in that class.\nWhen extracurricular activity's pop up at your school you have to try it just for the fun that's in it. It may help you learn new games to share and play with your family and friends. When you are board at home you can just do the different activity's you learned at school such as Basketball, Soccer, computer games, or Building race cars and more to give you something to do when you are tired of playing on your phone or playing on your game system and you can not find anything else to do\nExtracurricular activity's can really have a impact on your day in life. It can really help you get a lot of things done that you dont normally do on the daily bases instead of playing video games all day with your friends. These activitiesÂ can really help a board person have fun for a day",

        "Humans are like penguins. Just as penguins huddle together in the midst of a storm, humans huddle together in groups and find comfort and healing when they're with people that have the same interests. If that's the case, joining extra-curricular activities is a good opportunity to not only build life-long friendships, but also learn about different clubs and hobbies everyone can dive into.\nFor starters, being on a team automatically builds friendships and an unbreakable bond. A team is a group of the most valuable people in your life because members encourage one another and lift one another up. In many professional games, team members root for each other and help each other to be successful. When you see members respecting one another, there's no doubt about the friendship and love between the members. Also, people with the same hobbies become close very quick because of the same passion. I have met many of my close friends through the love of sports. Since my team had the same love of softball as I did, I felt as if I had known them for many years and something just clicked. Lastly, teams stick together. Through thick and thin, players stick together. Many professional players have been with each other for a long time. Since they've been together, they know each players strengths and weaknesses and how to help them. Gradually, a friendship forms and a life-long partner is born. All in all, being apart of a group not only forms a deeper love for the sport, but friendships beyond compare.\nSecond, anyone and everyone can be apart of a group. This is the perfect opportunity to try new things and learn about new hobbies. For example, many people didn't even know a club about learning sign language existed, but after trying it out, they became in love with the art of sign language and ended up becoming translators in the future. Also, you never know where this small hobby can lead to in life. For instance, one of my favorite hobbies is playing chess. When I was first forced to attend the club, I didn't know anything whatsoever about chess. However, I soon realized I loved playing chess and it was a good opportunity I seized. Lastly, everyone deserves a safe community full of people with the same passion. Research shows that those with a group to be in have a stable mentality and more self-confidence. Therefore, joining a simple community can even boost self-confidence and open doors to unknown hobbies.\nIn conclusion, being apart of a team or club benefits many aspects of life such as an incredible bond and friendship with team members, and a safe environment with other people that share the same interests. Something as simple as joining a club may change the way you perceive life. Just like penguins, everyone deserves a place to be.Â",

        "Having an extra curricular activity is a good way to find out what you like or dont like, or what you would to do later in life. It can be both a good and a bad thing. Having an extracurricular activity will help you make new friends, feel good about your self or just in general, and you can also be yourself.\nWhile doing an activity you will be able to make new friends. At the activity you will meet new people that you probably have never met before. By meeting new people you are gaining new friendships and gaining new people that you can count on, and trust. You can also meet people that have the same interest as you. Therefore you will be able to do stuff together and will end up going the the same activity, and will be able to do things together because you both like the same things. You will also be bale to understand each othersÂ point of view. When people are asking you question about your activity you can both see where each otherÂ are coming from and can give them tips and tricks that they can use in the activity, and you can agree on the pros, and cons, the easy, and not so easy parts. While in the activity you can meet new people, make new friends, and who know you could both be friends forever.\nBy looking for an activity you can find that one thing that you love to do earlier and younger in your life. You can find things that your good at may that be sports, acting, singing, photography, and so much more. Also you can keep searching until you find something that you want to put your heart into. By searching you may find new things that you never thought that you would like. Maybe you thought that you would LOVE basketball but then end up loving pottery. Or maybe you thought that you would LOVE acting but instead you like singing. There are so manyÂ things that you could end up trying and loving them. You could also find thing that will make you feel good, may that be about your self or in general. You may play a sport and start to notice that you are happier and not in as bad of a mood all the time. They say that by working out and doing a sport boosts your endorphin'sÂ making you happier. Or even doing something that you love will put you in a better mood because you cant wait to do it or go back to it again, and therefore will have something to look forward to everyday. Therefor you can find things that you love and continue to do it and grow and be better.\nHowever having an extra curricular activity can mean more harm than good. When you have an activity you may not have enough time for house hold duties or even your homework for school. Your activity may run later and you may get home late. The you will have to eat something if you didnt already before, and get ready for bed. But by that time you may not have enough time for your school work or the things that you need to do at home. But if you learn how to time manage everything that needs to be done then you should be okay. By challenging your self you are growing better as a person, and will be able to do things that may be harder for other people to do.\nIn conclusion it is a good idea to do an extra curricular activity as it will help you meet more people, be more comfortable with your self. Will help you get out of your comfort zone and get out there and live. Also find things that you are good at and love. And by doing something you love you are learning little by little to love your self. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "If you were a school principal, would you want your students to participate in extracurricular activities? As a result of their numerous advantages, many schools encourage their students to participate in them. My principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activityÂ can be beneficial, as it gives them a chance to make more friends, be more productive, and find possible career options or passions.\nOffering students the opportunity to participate in extra curricular activities gives them a chance to get to know more people, and make new friends.Â When socializing during these activities, they can get to know people that they would not meet without this opportunity. They can also share their passions or hobbies with other people who might have the same interests, causing them to become friends.Â The third reason is that they might see friends that they do not often see during the school day. These activities cause students to engage in different conversations, and be more social around other people.\nParticipating in extracurricular activities might result in students performing tasks that are more productive compared to what they usually do at home.Â At home, students might be bored and might not have any tasks or activities to complete after doing their homework.Â As an effect of not having anything to do, they might waste their time playing video games or going on social media. Similarly, this would be a waste of learning time where they could be more productive, and could find new ideas or projects to do. These activities can help students see that there are interesting tasks that they can explore, which are more useful than using social media, phones, or other distractions.\nEncouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them find possible career options, and discover new interests or passions. As they perform different tasks provided by these activities, they can find new interests that they did not know they had. Different chances offered can help students develop a passion that they already have, as they might not have necessary tools for it at home. Additionally, adults organizing these tasks can introduce career options in the field of the activity to students who are interested in them. Extracurricular activities can assist students in finding which pathway they will choose for their careers.\nAs a conclusion, all these factors are beneficial for the students, which show that these activities provided by the school can help them with their social life, as well as academics and other work. It encourages them to dedicate their time and effort. As proved by these reasons, the decision made by the school principal concerning extra curricular activities can be beneficial and extremely rewarding for students, by providing them with an opportunity to make new friends and get to know more people, perform productive tasks, and discover what possible career options and jobs there are in different fields.Â",

It could also lower morale at the school, because students could feel pressured or stressed.\nAn activity is not must, it is usually something thought about doing for maybe spare time. It is an invasion of freedom, In a way, to make students pick to either play a sport, work on a yearbook, or serve on the student council without their will and some type of benefit. It could also effect their parents/guardian, if students are made to play a sport, because the parents/guardian would most likely have to drop them off and pick them up from games or practices. It should depend on what the students want to do and what they can do, no one should ever be forced to do something if they don't want to do it.\nI think they should allow students to do an activity and give them the choice to decide if they want to do it or not. It could make the school benefit, if they did that, because it would raise moral and it would make students feel comfortable and not stressed.

        "Your principal has decided that all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Should schools make students do a extracurricular activity, do you agree or disagree? I disagree, schools shouldnt make students do that because the activities are something extra for the students who want it. Another reason is if you force someone to go out of their comfort zone, theyre less productive. Lastly, if it was a requirement the schools would need more activities such as clubs and sports teams. In conclusion, schools should not turn these activities into a requirement.\nFirst, schools shouldnt because it is meant for people who want something extra. People who do these activities usually require good grades. Others may be looking at something new. Then they're are ones who just like to do things so they do whatever interests them. This is why these activities are supposed to be something extra.\nAnother reason is if you force students or anyone to do something it usually means they're less productive. If someone joined a play for the school by force its most likely they will be removed because of either not helping or they're not working.\nLastly, if it was a requirement schools would have to make more clubs or sports teams. Schools can have a lot of students mine holds about 1,000 and they're are sport teams or clubs that are too large. FFA and FCCLA are competing clubs but if the schools make it a requirement people will choose them thinking theyll not do anything and ruin it for the ones who enjoy the club. Another good one would be if the school puts on a play certain people may ruin it by moving or breaking props or other impotantÂ items.\nIn conclusion, schools shoud not turn these activities into a requirement. Schools should leave these activites alone and let the ones who want to do them choose to do it. If the school did change the requirement there would be a lot of people who dont work.

Generic_Name wasn\'t keen on the thought of trying out for soccer. ""I mean, I\'m not very athletic, and I don\'t have very good foot eye coordination."" Generic_Name said wearily. ""That\'s okay. Just try it, you never know, you might enjoy it."" Generic_Name said, trying to motivate Generic_Name. Confidently, Generic_Name responded with, ""Okay, I\'ll try it."" All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.\nTo start with, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them make new friends. This is important because it can help a student who struggles socially. For example, say that you don\'t make friends very well. Joining a sport or a club will help you find someone who shares the same interests as you. Another reason is that it will help students become close with students that aren\'tÂ in their grade. For instance, almost all school activities are open to all grades. This is the only time students will be able to socialize with the grades above or below them. So it\'s important that they take advantage of it. Lastly, it\'s important that students make new friends because it can help them become more involved in school activities. To emphasize, I ran track my eighth grade year. My friends motivated me to tryout. I ended up loving it and making so many new friends with sixth and seventh graders.\nSecondly, requiring students to join a school activity will keep them busy. To start of with, when students are done with their homework they immediately go on their phone. To fix this problem, keeping students busy with a sport or a club will prevent them from being on their phone to much. Moreover, so many kids complain of being bored and not having anything to do after school. This is because they\'re not busy. To support my opinion, during track season I never complained of not having anything to do. I was always occupied either with homework or I was at practice. The last reason why it\'s important to keep students busy is because it gives them the opportunity to practice their time management skills. To illustrate, at the beginning of track season I was very stressed about how I was going to complete all my homework. By the end of the season I knew how to manage all my time and didn\'t have to stress on how I was going to finish my homework.\nFinally, requiring students to participate in a club or sport gets students get out of their comfort zone. Getting students\' out of their comfort zone is important because it prepares them for the work force. To elaborate, in the work force you don\'t get a choice whether or not you do something. You have to do it, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Another reason is that putting yourself out of your comfort zone can make you grow into a more confident person. For instance, I joined MAC committee when I was in eighth grade. Talking in frontÂ of a whole class made me uncomfortable. Now that I look back at it, it was worth it. I\'m so much more confident as a person.\nAnother reason is that getting out of your comfort zone can change your point of view. To illustrate, my friend\'s parents forced him to join the art club. At first he thought it was weird and only for the ""geeks"". Joining the art club changed his whole point of view. He now loves art and wants to pursue it as a career.\n""This is so fun!"" Generic_Name exclaimed, as she kicked the soccer ball. ""I told you, all you had to do was get out of your comfort zone."" Generic_Name responded. ""Yeah, you were right. I\'m so happy that you encouraged me to do this. I\'ve made so many new friends and found out I really enjoy playing soccer."" Generic_Name agreed, ""Me too. Soccer keeps me busy and off my phone."" In conclusion, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.',

Students may not have the opportunity to do there pleasures that may they do at home or once they get out of school. This can also interfere with a students social and sport life. Although there are down sides to extracurricular activities there is a huge benefit such as, knowing that a student has helped or even cared about what he was doing weather it was planting plants, trees, flowers, playing a sport, or even helping a student with their homework. I strongly stand by the that participating in an extracurricular is beneficial, not only is it beneficial it is also enjoyable.\nSome activities that students are able to participate in are sports, yearbook committee, student council, and helping out with the environment. Another way this is beneficial is because weather you like it or not it really helps out the person, the community, and even the ourselves.

Students often enjoy getting to know others and this is a great way to do so. How cool is it to know we have done an extracurricular activity and while helping our community? There are many activities that students are able to learn and put their brain to the test in a extracurricular session, for example student council. Student council is one of the many mind and brain focusing activities there are in these activities.\nExtracurricular activities can be enjoyable and entertaining.

Many students might disagree with this decision, because of some students not wanting to have an after school activity. However as being a student myself I have chosen to agree with this decision. When students have an after school activity, the activities that they choose to do can impact them in many ways. There are many reasonsÂ on why I believe that a student should participate in at least one after school activity. However, here are three reasons why I hold the opinion of students being required to have an after school activity.\nStudents will become more involved throughout their school community. If a student joins a school sport club they might be able to make some new friends. When students are able to make more friends they will not feel bored in a class if they have a new friend that happens to be in that same class. Students will also be able to know what is happening in other parts of the school, because of making new friends. When students are more involved in their schools community, they won't be confused of what is going on within their surroundings.\nWhen students have an after school activity, they might figure out what career they would want to have in the future. For example, if a student chose to serve on the student council. This extracurricular activity can help students to decide whether or not they would in the future run for a government position. If a school has Home EC as an extracurricular then a student might choose to become a baker in the future. Depending on the what your school offers, any activity you decide to join will help you when it comes time for choosing an occupation.\nIn the future students will be able to reflect on the things that they have done in the past. When a student becomes older their kids may ask what they did when they were younger. Which is a reason why students should work on their schools yearbook, because they will be able to show their future children what they did in school. These students will be able to show their children the yearbook that his or her classmates made together. Therefore, being another reason why students should participate in activities because of being able to reflect on the past.\nAs you may now know the many reasons on why I believe that students should have an after school club. Like I said before when a student chooses a certain activity, this activity may hold an impact on their life. Requiring students to have an extracurricular activity encourages students to be more involved. I believe that the principal has made the right decision by enforcing students throughout the school to join a club. In conclusion, I think that requiring students to have an activity will benefitÂ many students.",

For some students, it can take several hours to complete a single homework assignment. Students would have to stay up later to do their homework making them tired at school the next day.\nMandatory extracurriculars would create overcrowding in clubs, given that more students would be attending them. Some clubs have limits on the amount of students allowed in the club. More teachers would have to stay after school to accommodate the amount of students in extracurriculars. This change would take time away from teachers who have to grade our school work after school, causing them to have to work in their usual free time.\nOverall, this decision would change the entire idea of extracurriculars, making them seem like actual classes instead of the fun activities they are supposed to be. I believe that making extracurriculars mandatory for all students is a bad idea. I think participating in after school activities should be left to the choice of students and not teachers, and I hope this essay has made you feel the same way.Â",

        'Imagine your principal just annouced that all students must have an activity. He/she said the activity that it can be anything you want. The examples provided are such as, sports, extra studying, tutoring, and clubs. If there was a vote on having an extracurricular activity, I would vote ""yes"". There are many good and important reasons to have an activity, here is why.\nMy first good reason is that having an activity can be really fun. At the end of the school day, you would have something to look foward to. You can make new friends and spend some time with them. You can maybe discover a new hobby you are good at. You can do the stuff that makes you happy.\nMy next good reason for a having an activity, is that it would be helpful in school. If you are having trouble not understanding a subject or concept or your grades are low, this can solve that problem. By having private help from another person, this can make you understand a subject better. Also, it gives you a chance to bring your grade up. It can make you be a better learner or make you be ready and prepared for a test.\nMy final reason for having an activity is extra playing time for sports. School is sometimes fun, but if you like sports, than this is a good way to do the thing you really love. If you are just starting or just learning how to play, than this can be a big help. You would have the ability to know what to do in a practice drill or in a real game. This can make you be even better about baseball, basketball, or soccer etc.\nIn conclusion, having an extracurricular activity is a great idea. You can find the thing you are really good at. It is also a good time to socialize with other people. This is also one of the ways to get extra help in school. You can enjoy any of the things you love to do during this time of the day.Â',

        "I agree with the principle, because I think that kids should be active. Kids born in like 2003-2007 stay in all day with a phone in there hand, sometimes they forget to eat because they are to busy watching other peoples lives through a screen when they can do the same thing by going out side. I also think that kids should participate in after school programs because it opens up their young mind to different things like photography some people may not like photography till they try it out andÂ if they try it and like it they like it they stay but if they are not interested they can try some thing else.\nPersonally I like my schools after school program because next year I'll Be a freshman in high schoolÂ and I want to play football and my school has a program that you go to to lift weight. But they don't let join then lift you have to go through some kind of training where you have to do four week of training to touch a weight because they want you to be safe they don't want you to get hurt and not play football next year. Something that is SpecialÂ about this club it's run by the high schoolÂ coaches who are also gym teacher here at my school. My school also has a basketball team we play a school in Generic_City named Generic_School. My school Generic_School And Generic_School have a little rivalry. But My schools basketball team has tryout so they can get the best kids that my schools has so we can beat Generic_School. Really I think my school made a basketball team to let the kids have fun.\nI also think other schools need after school programs because some schools are placed in a bad area and the might live in bad areas with guns, gangs, and violence, but if they make an after school program and encourage kids to go you'll be pulling them from all the violence or joining a gang and doing drugs. Some kids have had to move schools and house just so their child does not become a gang member. I know some people who have ha to move because they lived in a bad neighborhood and their mom and dad pulled them out of school to come to a better school. I thin the principalÂ is just helping the kids enjoy school more and is also helping them stay out of trouble.\nIn conclusion, I think the principle is right because I think the principle is just trying to make school fun for kids and help the kids stay active. Therefore i agree with the principals decision to make an after school program.",

First of all,students have lots of work to do like homework,chours, projects, and etc. These things are a lot for some students to handle. adding a extracurricular activity that students must participate in would increase some students stress and could cause students to fail in school cause of how much work they have to do and complete. Finaly, some students just don't want to do it. Beause most students would finish their work and hang out and talk with their friends.

        '"" Generic_Name it is the beginning of your sixth grade year do you know of any clubs you would like to join?"" Generic_Name\'s mother asked. Generic_Name shrugged his shoulders and slouched to his room."" Oh Generic_Name I dont want Generic_Name to be excluded this year just likeÂ last year!"" Generic_Name\'s mother cried."" We\'ve got to give him time, he might feel pressured if we talk to him about it too soon."" Generic_Name\'s dad calmly said. Generic_Name\'s parents waited for him to make new friends or to join a club, but every single afternoon he walks into his room, then eats dinner and he doesn\'t say a word. That next Thursday Generic_Name came home and slouched into his room like always."" I\'m tired of this,"" Generic_Name\'sÂ mom said under her breath. She walked into Generic_Name\'sÂ room and screamed,"" Generic_Name I am tired of this, you can\'t hide away just because you are deaf. Your hearing aids are supposed to allow you to hear and talk to people, but you don\'t. You don\'t even talk to me."" Generic_Name\'sÂ dad walked in."" Generic_Name tell your son that he needs to make friends or at least join a club!"" Generic_Name looked at his mom in shock. Students should join a club because, it can help relieve stress from school, clubs can help you meet new people, and it can give you a hobby to do at home.\nFirst, students get stressed easily when a big test is coming up, or if they have a lot of homework and can\'t do it all. Stress can make you feel unhappy which can build up anxiety. When I was in sixth grade I was not in any clubs, and during tests I would panic and forget the answers. I decided to go to the councilor for help and the councilor gave me some good tips on how to keep calm during a test. Having a club to go to can give you something to look forward to during the school day and make you feel less anxious about school work. When I was in seventh grade I joined the yearbook and FAC\'S clubs. I didn\'t feel stressed during a test and my school work seemed easier than the year before.\nAlso, clubs are a great way to meet new people and make new friends. Somebody could like the same thing as you and you never knew. When I was a seventh grader I joined the yearbook club and on the first day\nGeneric_Name told us to get into groups of two or more and go to take photo\'s of the other clubs around, but I didn\'t know anyone. I was walking down the hallway with a boy, and to my surprise he put his hand out and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in eighth grade."" I took his hand and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in seventh grade."" Clubs can help you make that first step to say hello. In eighth grade I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club, I started talking to people that I had never talked to before. I found that these people that I have never talked to have something in common with me. I started to talk to these people I met around the school too.\nThird, sometimes when you join a club that club becomes a hobby and you start to do it at home. In my seventh grade year I joined the FAC\'S club. In the FAC\'S club we would bake and cook food, then I started to bake cookies and brownies more often at home and I also got my brother into it too. Know even though I am not in the FAC\'S club I still love to bake. Clubs can give you an opportunity to try something new, and most of the time if it is something that you like you start to do it at home. In my eighth grade year I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club. I shared it with my brother, and know we invite his friends to come play a campaign with us almost every weekend.\nGeneric_Name stood up and walked toward his mom, then opened his arms up to give his mom a hug. "" I am sorry mom,"" he said,"" I will try to make friends."" The next day Generic_Name came home and strolled down the hallway to his room. He came back out and walked over to his mom."" Hey mom,"" Generic_Name said. "" What is it Generic_Name do you need help with your homework?"" "" Well actually mom, I took a flier from the tennis club, I was wondering if you would sign it?"" Generic_Name smirked. His moms face lite up and jumped in the air. She grabbed a pen and neatly signed the formÂ like she was about to win the lottery. A few weeks later Generic_Name\'s mom was sitting on the bleachers cheering for Generic_Name who is working hard on the court. Generic_Name took the last hit and swung his racket as hard as he could. The ball hit the ground and the crowd on the bleachers jumped in the air. "" Nice one Generic_Name, you learn so fast!"" Generic_Name\'s friend exclaimed. "" Thanks."" He gave a smile to his mom who is sitting down and taking in every second.',

        "I definitely agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For one, it would help raise their GPA, especially if it is low at the moment. Most of the time there is an extracurricular activity for everyone, like STEM, Home EC, Yearbook club, Shop, and so on. Extracurricular activities provide a fun alternative than just going home at the end of the school day. Students can stay after school, come before school, or even go during their lunch period to their extracurricular activity.\nHowever, an injury or disability, like a broken leg or perhaps a learning disability could prevent a student from doing an activity that they want to do. Most of the time there are other activities that the student could do if they can't do the one they want. Sometimes, that particular activity could be canceled, maybe due to the weather if it is an outside activity, like a sports club, or maybe the supervisor isn't there that day. Maybe the student cannot go on a particular day because they already have something scheduled after school.\nSome people might not agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. They might say that the student may not have time for it, or there is no activity that they like. If there is no activity that a student wants to do, they can just start a club for it. If they don't have time for that particular activity after school, they can just integrate it into their daily schedule. For instance, if they can't do it on a Monday, they can do it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. They can also serve on the student counsel and perhaps get a particular activity listed as something other students can take. For example, if a school doesn't have a\nHome EC class, the student counsel can possibly try and get that into the course list.\nTaking an extracurricular activity is a good idea for anyone who: has a free schedule; wants to increase their GPA; or wants something fun to do. There is almost always an extracurricular activity for everyone. In conclusion, it is definitely a good idea to take an extracurricular activity whenever possible.",

        "In this day and age of society, most students that attend middle or high schoolÂ revolve around electronics. This is something that I think should change because some students prioritize using electronics over socializing with other classmates or friends. I agree with my principal, and I think that a student must participate in one or more extracurricular activity.\nParticipating in one or more after school activity in my opinion is a great way to socialize with new people, and make some new friends. Playing sports for example builds you as a team player, and helps you have a stronger connection with your team mates. I am currently training for freshman football at Generic_School for next year. Some of my friends and I go to Generic_School and work out in the weight room together, giving us a feeling of support from one another. During training, we are listening to music while we help each otherÂ out with the workouts we are supposed to do. While at workouts, we also get to know some of the JV and Varsity players who attend Generic_School currently. Doing football was a great Idea because of the strong bond I now have with my friends and the current high school players. When we have away games, we all take the bus to go to the other schools, and on the bus, we all talk and prepare our selves for those games. If you don't participate in a sport, general activities are great to socialize in too. Last year, I chose an activity which was out of my comfort zone, tennis. In tennis, I was in a group of about 7 or 8 other kids who I didn't know at all. But when I get showing up to the practices, and I kept making an effort to befriend the other kids, it ended up working out for the better. I got to make new friends and become good at the sport.\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity is also a great way to have fun. Even if the activity you want to participate in isn't a sport, you can always have some fun in an activity that interests you. Having fun for just an hour or so usually brings anyone'sÂ day up to a better mood. I participated in the yearbook committee in 6th grade at Generic_School and it was a great experience. I would have so much fun hanging out with all my friends while we were designing the yearbook and taking pictures for it. Now, even though the yearbook committee wasn't my first choice for my extracurricular activity, it was still really fun in the long run. I also played recreational league soccer in 5th and 6th grade. At the start of every season, our teams would switch players meaning I would have new teammates every time. This was a great way to have fun with different people and cooperate with them as a group. After every one of those activities, I would leave with a smile on my face, and just being there for that one hour made my whole day better.\nExtracurricular activities can also teach you a lot of new things. Yes, doing an extracurricular activity is fun and all, but you end up learning a lot. In the yearbook committee, I learned how to upload pictures onto a document, how to format the pages to have rows of pictures, and to decorate the pages with cool designs. In football, I learn the different types of positions to play, the different playing styles of other players, the different positions to play, and I also learn how to train properly to play the best I can possibly play. In soccer, I also learned different techniques on how to be the best player I can be. Some activities teach you more than let you have fun, but if you like the subject it is on, than it, again, is a great thing to do. I think learning while you are also having fun is one of the best things in life because it is always good to learn, but it also depends on how you are being taught.\nIn conclusion, doing an extracurricular activity benefits you more than anyone else. They teach you good things, you have fun while participating, and you get to socialize with your friends and potentially make new ones. This is why I agree with the principal, and I think we should do at least one. Â",

        "Do you ever wonder what it would be like, if your principal forced you to participate in an extracurricular activity?Â There would be much debate over whether it's a good idea, or a bad idea. Some students would agree with the principal. Some students would disagree with the principal. It's the same way with the parents. Here are three good aspects of having to participate, and my opinion. I agree because students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find a new hobby.\nMy first reason as to why I agree, is because students can get more exercise. Students get a good amount of exercise in gym. However, some students don't get any other exercise. Plus, it is always good to get more exercise. Students need to maintain a healthy body, because a healthy body is a healthy mind. Getting exercise releavesÂ stress for some students. some are lazy couch potatoes, and need to get off their butts.\nMy second reason as to why I agree, is so students can make new friends. Some students don't have a lot of friends. A student without friends is like a puppy left out in the rain. However, forcing them to participate in an extracurricular activity can change that. Some students like making friends, but don't know how to make friends. Some students have a lot of friends, but want more. If there is a new kid, it would give them the chance to make some friends and meet new people. Therefore, doing this can change a students life.\nMy third reason is so students can find a new hobby. On the one hand, some students have plenty of hobbies. On the other hand, some students don't have any hobbies. However, most students have one to five hobbies, which is a fair amount. For the ones that don't think they have enough hobbies, this a great way to help. Also, this could help some students figure out what they want their profession to be.\nIn conclusion, I agree that principals should force students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find themselves a new hobby. Students don't get nearly enough exercise in gym class. It's always good for everyone to make new friends. Also, you can never have to many hobbies. Doing this is good for everybody, even the staff. The staff members that participate will be working more hours, therefore, they would be getting paid even more money. If you think I'm right and made some good points, then show this to someone that can make this a thing in schools near you.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

I think this is a great idea and will benefitÂ many people. This would make students more active better member of society and brighten the students future in life. It would benefit the school and sports teams as well by having smarter hard working students.\nSchools have a lot of hardworking students but also have students who dont care and dont contribute to the school or themselves, making students participate in a sport, work on the year book, or serve on the student council would fix that. By making a student play sport you would make them work towards something out of school instead of just laying around, which would make the student a harder worker and benefit his grades. The sport would help the student have better ability to work with other people also giving them new friends to have fun with making school a more enjoyable place. Sports would also help the student become more healthy physically. Working on the yearbook or serving on the student council would benefit the student and the school in many ways such as giving students the opportunities to use there talants, and ideas to make the school a better place. Students could use there skills writing and putting pictures together or develope them while working on the yearbook. Serving on the student council, students could make changes to the school to better it for themselfs and others.\nI agree with this idea for the stuents and the school.

Students shouldn't have to participateÂ in extracurricular activities.\nMost teenagers now, participate in sports or other activities in there everyday life, so it might be a lot harder to manage school, an after school activity, and a sport outside of school. One of my friends has soccer practice everyday after school, so she has to leave school early to get there on time, but if she had to stay after school she would miss soccer practice, or she might level early and miss her after school activity. No matter what she does she will still miss one of them, but if she didn't have to stay after school she wouldn't have to miss practice or get in trouble for not showing up after school.\nParents might want there children home as soon as possible because they might have a younger child at home that isn't old enough to stay home alone or might not be responsible enough, so if they have an older sibling that can take care of them, they will take the opportunity. As an example*, I have a younger sibling at home who gets out of school around 30Â minutes before me, and my mom dose notÂ like it when shes home alone so when I come home from school I have to stay home until my mom comes home. Most of my friends have younger siblings, so if we all had to stay after school we would have to let our younger siblings stay home alone and our parents might not like that. Another thing parents might want there children home for is chores, if students stay after school they will have less time at home and wont have have time to complete all of there chores or get their homework done, plus some students may have sports or other activities so they would have even less time.\nThen there are the students like me, who dont have any interest in sports or talking in front of random people, students who do this will have to participate in sorts and work on teams and will most likely put little to no effort in what there doing and are only doing it because it is required by the school. Some students may like to play sports and make yearbooks but they might not like the sports the school has to offer or they might not like the people on the team, so again they might put very little effort in to what there doing. Others might just not be good at sports and prefer to read or draw rather then run around, throwing and catching stuff.\nIf students want to join a club or activity they should feel its because they want to and not because the school is making them do so, students should have freedom over joining extracurricular activities. All in all I believe that it would be better if the principal does not make extracurricular activities required.",

        'Students should be told to do at leastÂ one extracurricularÂ at school because doing an extracurricular can help students become more physically healthy, they can leave a lasting impression on their school and they can meet new people. All these can come from doing an extracurricular activity after school. I agree with this decision by the principal since most pupils will have good outcomes by doing an extracurricular activity. Students have a wide range of choices for their activity for example, students could choose to participate in sports such as baseball or basketball, work in the math club, the model U.N.\nAll the clubs you can think of the school most likelyÂ provides for their students to choose, however out of all the good reasons to force students to participate in these extra activities do have some setbacks. Some of these setbacks include the fact that maybe some students have responsibilities after school such as babysitting, jobs or religious reasons.\nFirst, Students who choose to be apart of clubs such as the Student Government or National Junior Honor Society can revolutionizeÂ their school and create change in rules that they do not favor as much as other rules. These clubs usually encourage free thinkers and people who wanna to create change and revitalize their school when it gets a little stale and boring. Some kids might join a sports team or musical ensemble and win a championship or a musical trophy that the school can proudly display like all the other trophies that the school has won. Most schools are very proud of their pupil\'s accomplishmentsÂ in or out of school usually displaying their accomplishments such as their students who went to the NBA like Kobe Bryant or became very famous actors like Tom Cruise.\nNelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the key to life and happiness"" and if that is true partially extracurricular can help you achieve that. As most colleges look at your application form they look at your Grades ACT and SAT but what they also look at is what extracurricular you are in such as clubs, sports teams or musical acts such as a band or ensemble.\nNext, students can become more physically healthy and fit when doing some activities after school. The main example of that is a school sports team that the students can join like track or swimming can help them lead a healthy lifestyle and lose weight while filling their requirements to do a school extracurricularÂ activity. These school sanctioned activities can help students become more fit and lose weight because of the sport. Sports in general are a good way to teach kids to be healthy and not sit at home all day and lay in bed or on a couch all day after school. Kids are easily impressionable to anything or anyone that tells them what they like such as a junk food commercial or a commercial for sugary cereal, these commercials tell them that the cereal that they are marketing is healthy but in reality it is just a sugary full of carbohydratesÂ cereal. By letting kids stay after and teaching them what foods are healthy for them or not we can reduce the impact that childhood obesity has caused the last couple of years.\nLastly, most students who participate in after schoolÂ activities can meet a lotÂ of new people who are interested in the same things as you are and you can talk to them in the clubs or other activities you have joined. Most people who join clubs are often interested in the same things as everyone else in that club, there even some clubs just about certain interests such as the anime club which is just a club for kids who like anime or manga. Other clubs and extracurricular are also good places to meet new people if you are new to a school and need people to talk to.\nthese friends you make can become lifelong friends of yours even out of school and into college or the workforce and adulthood. These bonds that you make in middle school and high schoolÂ can increase your social skills and help you with life skills like communication with other people, a skill needed in jobs like marketing where you most likely need to present in frontÂ of other people sometimes including your boss.\nIn conclusion, being told to do one extracurricular by your school isn\'t the end of the world you can make it fun by choosing a club or sport that you enjoy to do and it will not be a burden on you or your family. In these extra activities you can create a better you and show your school that, you can become healthier and you can always meet new people who share common interests with you. All the students are required to do an extracurricular most likely because the school just wants the best for you and your academic career whether that is from K-12 or beyond to college and the workforce extracurricular help you in many ways throughout your life, these clubs ensembles and teams can boost your self confidence, fortify your social skills while you have fun since you have chosen things that interest you and are not boring.',

This is why I believe that students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. I make this claim for three reasons, the first of which being that students are more involved in the community that the school built around them. My second reason is that students doing sport related activities helps with exercise and having the need to stay in shape for the team and the school. Last but not least, my third reason is that students that may not have many friends could use these activities as a way to get to know people that are doing the same sport or are in the same band. So I believe that these extracurricular activities would be beneficial not only to the students but the school as a whole.\nFor my first reason I stated that doing an extracurricular activity helps students get involved in a community that was created around them. Students that join sports or other activities provided usually get to know others that participate in the same team or group that the student does. Another reason to back up my claim is that in clubs or competitive sports teams these students generally train together and help each otherÂ succeed in the task that they are working towards achieving. I believe that these activities would help tremendously with letting students get to know each other and further strengthening the schools community.\nMy second claim is that doing extracurricular sports help students get exercise that generally they would not get, had they not been told to do any exercise outside of school. If these students play for a school team (football, wrestling, etc.) there is intense training involved that from, personal experience, is not easy. Im not saying to go run a mile or anything but these sports try to get every competitor in great condition in order to get students to succeed in tournaments and bouts or matches against other teams. So there is a huge exercise component to most sport related activities.\nFor my third reason, let's start with a small story. So, imagine that there is a student that moves around every two to four years. it was pretty difficult to make friends so he generally stayed at home playing video gamesÂ by himself and didn't really go out at all. That was me until around three years ago and doing sports like wrestling and rugby have helped me make friends. So I understand how difficult it is to always be the new kid but these activities let me make friends and get to know people. Students that do these activities usually make friends with the people that have the same interests in activities.\nI believe that enforcing this rule would be beneficial not only to the school but the students as well and these reasons are why I believe in this rule. Communities get built around the students when they do these extracurricular activities. Physical fitness is also a big motivator for a few students with sports related activities. And last but not least, these students can make friends in these activities like I did when I used to move around a lot. Extracurricular activities would be a good service to enforce in schools.",

        "According to recent surveys, around 86% of students participate in extracurricular activities. Students playing sports or being in the year book club has been very beneficial for them. They can learn a lot from the activities, as well as representing the school. Participating in an extracurricular activity should be a requirement for the following reasons: Students will learn something new, students will gain life skills, and the school will see growth in their sport teams.\nFirst, students will learn something new. Not all students have participated in an extracurricular activity. Students who haven't done so, will be taught something they didn't know how to do. When I was in the sixth grade, a couple of my friends and I tried out for something we had never done before. We tried out for the middle school lacrosse team. We learned a lot from our coach and went from not knowing how to catch the ball, to being pretty decent at the sport. Not only can students learn something new, they can also gain life skills.\nSecond, students will learn life skills. Students will learn to show commitment, leadership, and responsibility. My father was a really good soccer player in high school and college. He tells me all the time about the three most important things: commitment, leadership, and responsibility. He also made it very important that I knew about the hardships of being on a travel team like he was on. He had to commit to playing soccer in all of his spare time, always practicing, he had to show leadership and get all the practices and games and help those in need, lastly, he had to show responsibility by making it to all the practices and games on time and prepared. This is why students will learn life skills. Not only can students benefit from extracurricular activities, the school can as well.\nThird, the school will see a growth of students coming to the school. These numbers help the school earn rewards and more money. When people see a school earning a bunch of rewards, they tend to switch to that school if they are in the same activity that is winning rewards. When the school gets more recognition, they will tend to get better players and will keep gaining rewards. One of my friends used to go to the same school as me but then he went to another school that had a better football team and was known for winning the division title. That school has gotten a ton of people to go to their school because of an extracurricular activity. This why the school will see a growth of students going to their school.\nHowever, others believe that students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity. They also say that students shouldn't have to be tied to school any longer than they already are. This wrong for several reasons: students will gain knowledge and life skills from these activities, students will have fun doing so, and students won't be at school for much longer than the normal school day. These activities are not just there to torture the students, they are there to help them excel and grow as a person. The activities will also prepare the students for the rest of their lives.\nIn conclusion, it should be a requirement for students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students will learn something new, students will learn life skills, and the schools will see a growth of numbers in the activities available. These are reasons why students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. I hope that you will think about participating in an extracurricular activity.",

        "In my opinion I think it is a good idea that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students in thier social aspect, help them become more active, and it can help them learn new things.\nDoing things that involves communication can help a student's social aspect. For example, doing different things such as clubs can help students connect to each other and help them to be more open around other people. If a student isn't good at being open, participating in an activity will be good for them. When a student doing somthing active it can be many different things. Sports can also make you more active by it being fun to the students. Students can also be active by helping the community around them such as recycling or donating. In activitys students can learn new things in many different ways. For example, if a student doesn't know what to do in their future, participating in an activity can help them find that. While students are doing things with other students, they can learn from each other to learn new things.\nIn conclusion it will be good for students to partcipate in a least one extracurricular activity. When students are partipating in different activities it can help them improve different skill sets and help them learn things.Â",

Extracurricular activities are not for everyone. You should have the right to pick what you want to do.\nLife is full of choices not being told you can and can't do something. Activities like sports, yearbook staff, or serve on the student council is your choice nobody else can make them but you. Principals are just making sure the school is in order not to tell you that you have to play sports. People everyday make choices who told them to make the choice they told their selvesÂ to make the choice. You need to choose for yourself not be told by a high schoolÂ principal that you have to do something.\nMaking choices is how people live. If a principal thinks he can tell kids what they can and can't do he is in a world of hurt. School is the best years of your life and going through school doing what you are told by one person will get you nowhere in life. School is where you learn make friends and do what you want after it is over not be forced to do something. School is a lifetime of memories but doing what you are told creates no memories it creates really bad stories.\nSchool is fun and creates memories. Being told by your middle or high school principal that you have to do some kind of after school activity is not. Only you can make the choices that will get you through school. Nobody else can choose for you. After school activities are fun but not for everyone.\nIn conclusion being told to do an after school activity by your principal is not the kind of school to go to. Then in another sense being told by your parents is different. Your principal can't tell you to participate but your parents can. An after school activity is something you need to do if you want if now then go home and do whatever you want to do.

        "I would agree with the decision to make all students participate in after school activity. I would agree with this decision for a couple of different reasons. One of them would be bringing people together. Parents may start to think and appreciate the teachers more for going above and beyond staying after schoolÂ to work with there kids. This would paint a new path and a new picture for the schools future.\nNot only only would extracurricular activities get more students and teachers working together forming good relations, but it would help students see teachers and the school in a new light. Students may start to appreciateÂ there teachers more and may start to like them. Students could feel more confident with there teachers because they share some of the same interests. Not only this but the teachers may get to see how hard working there students are working outside of school, and maybe the students just need a push or in other words a little bit of help.\nI feel like parents also would appreciateÂ getting the kids off there butts and getting them to interact with there fellow teachers and students. By making encouragingÂ there kids to have a open mind about after schoolÂ activitiesÂ they could also find out what there schools offer and possibly the parents could be interested. The students who look at taking after schoolÂ activitiesÂ with a good attitude will get hooked and find something they really enjoy. When the students come home from there extracurricular activities they could tell there parents all about it and maybe teach there parents something they dont know.\nWhen you sign up or good to a after schoolÂ activity try and go with at leastÂ one friend who is also interested in the same topic. This will give you a safe feeling and you will have someone to share the fun with you! Not only will you have one friend there but if you bring a friend there is a 100% chance you will make more friends there. The teachers will find it very excitingÂ you found a extracurricular activity you enjoy and made new friends. With all the work you will be doing in your after school activity at leastÂ when it gets hard you will have a friend next to you to make it better.\nIn conclusion I think this is a very positiveÂ decisionÂ made by the principal and agree with it completely. There are so many benefits to going to after school activities. Meeting new people and finding interests you may have never new about. For all you know you could have found a career you love and want to do as a job. Finding new friends and meeting new teachers and strengthening you relationship with your teachers is a very smart thing to do. I would highly recommend other schools to do the same as this school and help your students find a activity they love.",

        "Do you want to be forced to work on something? No one does and if a school makes you do an extracurricular activity thats whats going to happen. If we have activities in school, then the after schoolÂ activity would have to be after school. There is a reason why we have P.E, FACS, coding, and stuff like that. We have those classes so that we dont have to do after schoolÂ activity.\nThe first reason why students shouldnt have to do extracurricular activities is because they could already be doing and activity. Whether its Babysitting siblings, playing with toys at home, playing video games, doing sports, or even doing a cooking class. Those are good activities, and even better, its an activity that they like. what if the student doesnt like any of the activity choices given to them. That could be bad for the child. Its like making a person eat when their full already, And to add onto this, The child could also be going somewhere already like out to eat, going to their moms house, dads house, friends house or a restaurant\nAnother reason schools shouldnt make kids do extracurricular activities is because after a long day of school or work you want to just chill and sit down, listen to relaxing music, drink soda, eat food, and all that good stuff. What if your school took away that time from you? That wouldnt be that great because then you have no down time. another thing you could do in this free time is study, do homework, and even work on some other stuff. this time could give student more time to complete and understand their homework. This would make the student more focus and responsive during class.\nThe last reason I have for disagreeing with making kids participate in extracurricular activities isÂ because the kids pick up time would change. some parents that go to work everyday get sleepy. they want to sleep after work just like the child does after school. parents get sleepy fast and thats because they have a lot to deal with. If schools dont do this, than the after school stuff wont be a problem. another reason is because the parent could be working afternoon hours the day that the child has to be picked up. Then the parent is going to freak out and try to get someone to get the child for you. the next reason is because the parent doseÂ notÂ have enough time to pick up the chi;d. and the last reason is because maybe you dont have the money to drive miles to you son or daughtersÂ school.\nIn Conclusion, if schools dont make kids do extracurricular activities, then none of this will happen. So I say we should save the troubles and just not do it. Treat people how you want to be treated. I think this is mean to the children because I feel like the children should have a say in what they want to do.",

Having students participate in extracurricular activities is very beneficial for your mental and physical health and has many advantages to the students participating.\nOne reason why being involved in extracurricular activities benefits you is because it's overall good for you. It can build time management which is a really important skill to have as an adult. Another skill you need to have is good social skills, and being around the other people in your activity helps build social skills. When you have good social skills talking to people and being social builds your self esteem and confidence and your mental health is just as important.\nParticipating in these extracurricular activities is actually really helpful for your future. Colleges love to hear you've done extra things. Even if you dont plan on going to college the extracurricular activities help you shape your life and see what you would like to do.

You can make friends with the same interests and hobbies.

        "Students may not always make the best decisions,but we still chose what we wanted to do whether it would affect us or not. We don't make all of the decisions, because we have parents, guardians, and sometimes teachers to help us stay on the right track. However, if a person is in a spot where they could control what we do,like a principal, than their decisions could make things a whole lot worse or better. If our principal forces us to do an extracurricular activity, than I would say\nNo!\nThe reason why is because, We might get stuck with an activity that we've never done, We might have to miss it because of other important matters, and finally if we miss it, we would have to deal with the repercussions\nFirst things first, we have an extracurricular activity that we might not know or be familiar with at all. If the principal just assigned everyone to a random extracurricular activity(lets assume that thats what happened and that we could notÂ change it.) than the chances of people particularly knowing that activity go down by a lot. If you are not a type of kid who hates to run around, or, you have asthma and you can't run,what if he accidentally enrolls you into the soccer club. You go up and tell the instructor that you can't run and they say, thats fine, but, the principal will be somewhat mad that you can't do the program. \"\"I guess i'll ask himÂ to get you a different one this time.\"\"Or what if you get stuck with a game like cricket. It is extremely hard to learn how to play that game, and it also is super hard for newcomers. If you were stuck with something like that, than you are not going to have fun with it.\nNext one up, The game that you cannot show up for (After school activities).Lets say that you were chosen to be on the student council and you have a meeting after school. UnfortunatelyÂ you have a therapists appointment after school at the same time. Will the principal force you too stay or will he let you go like he should do. You might have soccer practice for the junior league championship game that is coming up but you have to sit in a chair and talk about the budget for the Shrek junior play instead. It just would'nt work out with allÂ of the problems, and also the fact that all kids are different and that they should'nt be forced to stay after and miss something important because of their extracurricular activity after school. I just feel like they should let us do what we need to do after school and not bother us with after school extracurricular activities.\nLast things last, The cruel and unusual punishments for missing these extracurricular activities. The principal would punish those who either missed his extracurriculars or made a fuss about them. it would usually range from detention to having to eat lunch in another room. However, if you miss 3 after school curriculars than he would call your parents, 6 he would suspend you, and 10 or more he would expel you, (Permanently). He did do a good job of enforcing his rules too. He has resource officers and they will tell the principal if you have been missing out on his after school activities. The principal really is no joke, so i recommend stayingÂ on his nice list. Even though I still don't agree with him at all for doing this.\nIn Conclusion, No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might, and besides, thats just my opinion and i'm just a kid so what do I know. All i know that it is time to wrap up everything here and it is time for me too leave. I will be taking my leave now,it was surprisingly fun while it lasted, alright, enough with the dawdling see you later, I guess.",

I have so many memories and unforgettable moments from my basketball season and I made many friends. Yesterday I was greeted by Generic_Name, one of the three seniors from basketball,""Hey Generic_Name!"" she said with a big smile as she walked back to softball practice. Basketball season ended a month ago, but the team bond and relationships continue on. Everyone should have the amazing experience I did of being involved in an extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal\'s decision for all students to participate in one after schoolÂ activity because of the importance to our school community, building character, and the lasting impact.\nParticipating in after school activities is important to our school community as a whole. Within a school, positive relationships are key to a beneficial education as well as experience for each student. Throughout extracurricular activities students build relationships with others through common interests. Such as through sports, you develop a relationship with your team. You crave to get out on the court or field to play the game you both love and look forward to seeing each and everyone of your teammates.\nParticipation in programs will help to develop and build the character of each student. Students exercise real life skills that are needed for the workplace. Each program is centered around teamwork which requires collaboration, communication, and compromising which are key components of many jobs. Other skills developed within these programs include leadership by demonstrating through example and time-managementÂ skills by deadlines for assignments. Getting involved in a programÂ may spark your interest in a future career such as a reporter, lawyer, or a political figure.\nExtracurricular activities have a lasting impact. The word impact is a two sided word, it is not only what we are impacted by it is who we impact as well. Each program is made up of a diverse group of students from different backgrounds bringing different perspectives. Everyone has a story to share of their journey, we are inspired by others stories and impacted by their personalities and action they take. Each story or action has a different impact, perhaps the desire to change the world or to look at something with a new perspective. The relationships and inspiration sparked by after schoolÂ programs have a two-sided impact.\nI agree with our principal and believe that every student should participate in an after school program because of the impact sparked by relationships and the development of many skills. Whether it is tennis or serving on the student counsel, I encourage you to get involved in an after school activity because it will no doubt bring more energy and joy to your life. There are a sea of options to choose from. Take a little time from your day to check out the bulletin board beside the main office to view the after school activities posted there. I promise you will not regret it; it will change your life and world for the better.',

Or for athletic students they could be on one of the sports teams. Having students be in a extracurricular activity is a win-win in every situation. I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it could help students with their school work, it can be a opportunity for students to become more social and make new friends, and it could help students get to know the school and staff and make the school a better learning environment.\nSome students might need help in some of their classes. So because of that reason they could be in an extracurricular club like study hall or homework club. Students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. If a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. Sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. These are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes.\nBy being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people. Some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school. They could meet those who they share common interest like video games for example and could bond over those things. Or people who like sports and like to talk about sports. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for students to bond and get to know the people they go to school with.\nBeing in these extracurricular activities students can get to know the school and staff better and make their school a better learning environment for themselves and others. Some students might not know a lot of information about the school they're attending. But with these activities students can connect with their teachers and staff on a deeper level and get to know them more. This could also help them in the classroom. By knowing more about their school they could contribute to making their school a better learning, safe, and fun environment to be in. This is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment.\nI think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and it should be implemented into the school. There are a lot of great things and opportunities coming from this decision. It can help students more than just academically. It can also help them socially. They can connect more with their school and make it a better place.

        "An extracurricular activity by nature is designed to be optional, something that students can join to support their hobby. Sports are a popular example, because if you are enrolled in the school, you don't have to spend extra money to join a sports team. This is great news for the people interested in all the sports their school has to offer. But not everyone wants to join the sports team. Even if you take into account all the other extracurricular activities at school, there will still be people who aren't interested in any of them, and it would be impossible to cover all categories and hobbies of every student at school to make an activity for each of them. This is why I believe the ability to opt out of an extracurricular activity is a fundamental part of the activity itself, hence the \"\"extra\"\" in the name, and I'm going to tell you why forcing students to participate in one is a very bad idea.\nLet's say for this example we single out one particular student, and this student's name is Generic_Name. Let's also say that Generic_Name has a hobby of creating and collecting model airplanes, to display on the shelf of his room. Generic_Name's hobby isn't a very common one, but that's okay. He prefers to build them alone, in the quiet of his room, and maybe share pictures of them online with another small group of model airplane enthusiasts. Generic_Name chooses to spend most of his free time doing this, and he enjoys it. Unless he can't, because the school just made that choice for him, and now Generic_Name has to sign up for an extracurricular activity. Generic_Name's school doesn't have a model airplane building club, as most schools don't, so Generic_Name is forced to spend his free time doing something he doesn't enjoy. He barely has any time to invest into his real hobby anymore, since he has to spend all afternoon at the chess club. As his happiness plummets, so do his grades. The school has nothing to really gain, and certainly a lot to lose, by implementing this system.\nThis leads me to my next point, which is also a question. What does the school gain by putting this rule in place? What benefits does the school get by forcing each and every student to participate in an extracurricular activity? Are they not taking into account the amount of protests to this rule, or the amount of students who will skip the extracurricular activity anyway? What could make them want to introduce this rule so badly, that they would ignore all of the negative consequences that come with it? There is no reason that I can think of that could support this rule even being thought of. A rule like not being allowed to chew gum at school, while pretty silly, still has a reason. It's so that students won't stick their chewed gum underneath the table, and while I would never do something like that, I still completely understand and can get behind this rule. This is in stark contrast to a rule like forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity, where I couldn't think of a single reason for it's existence.\nAll in all, I think adding this rule to any school would only lead to disaster. It only brings negative consequences to both involved parties, and if there are any schools already with this rule, they would most certainly be better off without it. There isn't a single reason I can think of for a rule like this to be made. These are all the reasons why I think forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is a very bad idea.

Why should a student be forced into an activity when they have chores? what about the amount of extra stress? Plus, sports and yearbook aren't everyone's favorite thing.\nAs stated before, some kids don't have time for things like activities. A student might have to babysit a sibling, do chores, work around the house, or even have a job!\nThere's no reason for making extra activities mandatory. Meetings early in the morning? Less sleep for growing children. After school? There's enough at home to handle. Even the middle of class wouldn't work, as the student would fall behind.\nNot only will it mess up a kids schedule, it'll cause stress. Life can be stressful for students. Especially when dealing with tests, quizzes, and changes to the student. Add in an activity that'll cause them to have less distressing time and you'll have a meltdown waiting to happen. You can't expect a student to be able to handle that. If students actively pick an activity to do, it's because they know they can handle the time management.\nAnd finally, Not everyone is going to be interested. Sure, the students might be cool with it for the first week, but then it'll be bothersome and annoying. Activities should be optional, not mandatory. It takes the fun out of everything. Whether you let the students pick or not, it won't matter. Not everyone wants to join the sports team. Not everyone wants to work for the yearbook. Some people would prefer going home and relaxing at the end of the day.\nWhile it seems like a good idea, mandatory participation should't be a thing. Most kids are trying to spend time with family, not giving them time to do sports. Some people might already be stressing over tests and grades, causing more stress in activities. And let's not forget that not everyone would be interested in kicking a ball around or painting. It may be for the best, but it's also the worst to make activities mandatory.",

        "Most adults who participated in extracurricular activities say that they have helped them through their lives. Although they might have helped them, some students never had the opportunity to participate in them. My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because extracurricular activities help students learn time management, meet new people, and they learn amazing skills to use outside of school and when applying for a job.\nStudents who participate in an extracurricular activities learn outstanding time management skills. They have to balance their school work and have to find time for practice and meetings. Also, they lean how to plan for things, and get everything done before a deadline.

Lastly, you learn how to work with a team and how to come to an agreement with them, you also learn when to argue and notice when not to.\nIn conclusion, I agree with the principal in his decision to have everybody participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

        "What if everybody did have an after school activity? Would it technically be a good thing? I disagree with the principle. I think that requiring everybody to have an extra curricular would be too demanding. There are also more reasons why I disagree with the principle. I will be writing about the reasons that I disagree with the principle.\nSome kids don'd do extra curricular activities because they have stuff home and family related. Some kids wouldn't have a ride back home from these activities. Now, I know that your thinking, \"\"Can't they ask their friends?\"\" But honestly, is there every friend for every person who doesn't have a ride? Why do you think there is a such thing as a taxi now? And some children, including myself, live farther away than most kids in their school. Not many parents are willing to drive far away for a child that isn't theirs. Also, there are some religions that do certain rituals on a daily basis, at certain times. Like prayers, or temple visits, etc: Some children just have a bed time. So not every one could make it to these activities.\nA lot of children that do after school activities have homework and chores to do when they come home. There would be a less likely chance of these getting done, if everybody had an after school activity. Some kids struggle while they are at school, and they use their time at home to study and try to help gain their academic skills. If they are like me, a lot of kids can't really focus at school and usually finish projects and stuff of that sort at home. Some children just can't balance school and extra curricular activities and either stop doing the activity, or lack academically.\nAlong with the other things that I mentioned, some parents/guardians of the students can't afford the extra things that go along with doing these activities. For example: A lot of boys could play sports like basketball and football, but there are expenses to these things. You have to buy helmets, knee pads, shoulder pads, shoes, socks, food for games, and practice attire. Even things other than sports require paying something. Things like art supplies, musical instruments, money for costumes or outfits. There are some after school activities that don't require money, but most do. I have met a majority of kids' parents that just don't want to pay the money for the sport that their child wants to do.\nThese are some of the reasons that I disagree with the principle. They are valid and practical. I'm thinking about the many reasons why kids don't do after school activities and why it is important to understand these kinds of situations. I have met many kids who has wanted to do a sport, but can't because of a valid reason, like the ones I have listed. You have to take into consideration why everyone isn't doing an extra curricular activity now, and be satisfied with the ones that try and/or do.Â Â",

        "Most schools have extracurricular activities, such as playing sports or working on the yearbook. Most students enjoy these activities and are grateful to have the chance to participate in them. In the majority of schools, a student is not required to take part in one of these activities. However, if the principal of a school were to decide that all students must participate in one, then their decision should be supported because the extracurricular activities will help students find new interests, they will allow them to meet people with similar interests, and skills such as teamwork will be encouraged.\nOne reason in support of a principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities is that they help people find new interests. Often times, a student may assume that a certain activity is boring or a waste of their time. However, this is impossible to know until it is tried out. After trying it out, the student may realize that it is fun, and a great way to spend their free time. Sometimes, a student may simply think that they do not have the time to participate in a club or a sport after school. However, after doing it once and realizing how much they enjoy the activity, they may reconsider whether or not they do not have much time. Both of these scenarios result in the student having a good time, and this enjoyment can only be credited to the principal, as they are the reason why the student participated in an activity. So, by being forced to be in a club or sport, students will expand their amount of hobbies and interests.\nAnother reason why the principal made a good decision is that it will allow students to meet those with similar interests. If everyone has to do an extracurricular activity, they will all go to the one that they are most interested in. For example, those who like taking photos may go to yearbook club. Now, all of those who have the same hobbies are together, and they will most likely become friends, as they can bond over their interests. This was only possible because of the principal's decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities.\nThe last reason why the decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities was a good one is that it encourages skills, such as teamwork or persistence. In most sports, such as basketball or soccer, teamwork is a skill that is always used. The players must communicate with each other to make the best play. They must encourage each other, and keep them from getting nervous. Teamwork will also be used when students grow up. Many jobs will require employees to work in a team to complete their work. By practicing this skill earlier, students will be better prepared for when they grow up. Another skill that is encouraged is persistence. If one gives up after facing a problem, no work can get done. For example, if one is taking part in a mathematics club, they will have to solve a variety of problems. Some may seem like they have no solution. However, if the student gives up after they cannot find a solution, they will not learn anything. Also, they will be ill-prepared for when they grow up and face a myriad of other challenges. If, when they face these challenges, they just give up, they will not be able to do all they are supposed to do. By participating in extracurricular activities, students will not grow up without these skills, and can instead accomplish everything they need to, and more. The one who is responsible for this is the principal, who made students take part in these activities.\nIn conclusion, a principal's decision to require students to participate in extracurricular activities is a good one because students will find new interests, make new friends, and build skills that are absolutely necessary in adult life. By taking part in these activities, students will both enjoy themselves, and they will gain the skills needed throughout their life.Â",

        "Frisbee, video games, art, coding, cooking, and soccer are only some of the many options of extracurricular activities that you can take part in. Extracurricular activities require no sign upÂ and no prerequisite, which is great for new students, for they can do it even if they have no prior skills or knowledge related to the activity. I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows students to socialize and collaborate with their peers, as well as meet people with the same interests. All while doing an activity they enjoy.\nTaking part in an after schoolÂ or extracurricular activity lets you socialize and collaborate with friends you may already have, or students that you haven't met yet.Â EitherÂ way it's a great way to have fun and build a better relationship with your peers. Communication and collaboration skills are some of the most important skills in life. Going to extracurricular activities lets you practice and use those skills. Additionally, when students work with peers they share the knowledge and skills that they already have with each other, so in addition to what they're learning in the activity, they are learning new things from each other.\nExtracurricular activities give students the chance to meet people with the same interests;\nattending one or more of these activities allows students to engage with one another.\nThis is good because some students can be shy when trying to make new friends because they can't start a conversation.\nExtracurricular activities gives students that are more shy the opportunity to talk to one another and begin a friendship, because meeting people with the same interests as yourself are a lot easier to talk to. This can all happen while playing a game of chess, basketball, or other extracurricular activities.\nIn conclusion, the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity should be a simple decision because these activities are a great way to practice life skills like communication and collaboration. As well as the perfect place to meet people with the same interests. This will also provide students who are more shy the opportunity to talk to their peers, make friends, and create friendly relationships with the people around them.

        "Many students play a sport or are involved with an activity such as a club, student council, and even NJHS (National Junior Honors Society) as well as other in school or outside of school activities. Most students go home everyday and relax the whole time and don't feel the need to exercise or do anything. This can start to take affect on their health and mental well being or even cause them to not care about school as much as to say someone who plays a sport for their school and attends clubs after school. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity or multiple activities of their choice for the benefit of their health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about.\nPlaying a sport is a healthy and enjoyable thing to add to your life. Sports help increase your endurance, muscle tone, overall health, and even helps you lose weight. Students who play sports tend to be less tired during the day and are much healthier than say a student who stays inside all day and doesn't play outside with friends or plays a sport. By adding a sport to your life, it gives you plenty of exercise and workouts each day and allows you to keep in shape and stay healthy.\nWhen school is over, many students only think about how they're going to relax that day or what they're going to eat as soon as they get home. Most students don't really have much to do the rest of their day and often get bored most days after school. By doing an extracurricular activity such as a sport or club, it allows you to eliminate that boredom and have something to do either everyday or at least a few times a week. You can have something to look forward to everyday at least and can do something you love instead of sitting on the couch waiting for tomorrow to come. It's best to choose an activity you really like, by doing something you love, it makes it both enjoyable and makes you feel less stressful since it's an activity you really like and enjoy.\nSome students find school very challenging or have mental disabilities that prevent them from easily completing school and gives them challenges they have to figure out how to overcome. School clubs such as homework clubs or even clubs that are dedicated to a specific subject or idea can help a student really understand the content they're learning about and help make it easier to focus in class and not struggle as much. Clubs that are dedicated to certain ideas or subjects often learn more about that subject or idea because of the fact that it mainly focuses on specific content or a wide range of data related to a certain genre. By joining a club, you immediately learn more than you would in a class because it's a more open learning environment and different people share their knowledge instead of maybe 1 teacher.\nI do agree that our principal should make all students participate in an extracurricular activity because of the benefits for your health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about. Everyone should find an activity they love to do and add it to their life to benefit them even if it's multiple activities.",

Thats why agree to this so people would'nt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport.\nReason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too.\nReason number two everyone should do something in there lives should'nt be lazy because that would'nt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lotÂ of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason.\nReason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. won't have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time you'll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play.\nThats all my reason I hope that a lotÂ of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life is'nt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment. So thats all I have to say about being a leader not a follower like do something once again u only live once make ur life go big. Â",

        "Doing extracurricular activitys is like having field day, they are fun and you can do many different activitys. The principal wants all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activitys. Here are some reasons I agree to having extracurricular activitys for all students. For, it can help build social skillls, it can give students a chance to exercise, and can decrease boredem and stress.\nTo begin with, building social skills is an good way to make new friends for example, you can make new friends by joinging new clubs, meeting new people such as coaches, and learing and sharing new ideas between people in your activity. Some students may be shy when it comes to new people; joining clubs like bookclub and art is a great way to find people that has the same interest as you.\nNext, many students may want a chance to exercise by joining sports. Joining different sport teams can help with exercise for example, track can increase your cardiovascular indurance and build your speed. Using sport activitys can teach students how to exercise and how to be healthy.\nAlso, students may want to join extracurricular activitys to decrease boredem and stress. Joining these activitys can get your head out of stressing situations. Say you failed a test you would not feel so great afterwards but to get your mind out of it you can go to your extracurricular class and study more for your next test of get you mind off things. Serving as student council can decrease boredem by setting up school dances and a bunch of other fun activitys.\nHowever, some students may disagree and not want to participate in extracurricular activitys due to being lazy, grades, or behavior. When students are to lazy they tend to skip out on things like sports. Grades are a big part in not being able to join a extracurricular activity due to lack of doing homework, or not participating in class. Behavior in some students may affect them from joining a club too because their mother or father may want them to change their behavior first.\nIn conclusion, I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activitys. For, it can help build their social skillls, students can get chances to exercise, and decrease boredem and stress. These are great ways for students to make new friends and build goals for the future.",

In my opinion you and your parents should be able to decide if you can participate in an extracurricular activity.

Some medical disorders like down syndromeÂ or dyslexia mightÂ be the reason that some people will not play sports. Because they might get sat on the bench during a game, and they could feel left out and that would lead to other medical disorders.\nTheir parents might say they cant do some sports or activities. Or they think that the school should work on the yearbook, and would prefer their child not to work on in. If parents think that schools are wrong for making kids do at least one extracurricular activity they should not have to participate in that activity. In my opinion parents and students should be able to chose. and i thin it's a right for the parents and children to chose.\nif students disagree and parents agree they can make them participate. On the other hand what if they both disagree? If they both disagree then they should mot have to do an activity. because the school bored can not make students do much other than show up and leave. who would want to be in the student council anyway!\nIn conclusion schools should not be able to make children participate in extracurricular activities. Because some kids have medical disorders, their parents might not agree with the activity ,and the students might not agree with the activity. also the childrens parent, guardian,or doctor might have told then not to do certain sports.",

        "Wouldn't it be awesome to always have something to do at the end of a long boring school day. Extracurricular activities give you that chance. I believe that everyone should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity every school year. I think this because of all the benefits. Also, every extracurricular activity has a different advantage. The extracurricular activities I think everyone should be a part of are: sports, academic, and different clubs.\nThe first, and my personal favorite, extracurricular activity is sports teams. Sports teams create a way for kids to get exercise. Kids are recommended to exercise 60 minutes each day. Joining a sports team ensures that you reach that goal. Not only would it be healthy, but the student would feel good about him/herself. Teamwork is also and benefit to joining a sports team. Teamwork is one of the most important skills. It's one of the the only skills people absolutely need to be successful in life. Sports teams are one of the best ways to practice and get better at that skill. Another skill acquired in sports teams is leadership. In sports teams leadership is always a reoccurring skill. You also need to show leadership throughout you life, similar to teamwork. Some may be a bit shy and not necessarily know how to correctly take a lead in situations, but sports teams could definitely fix that.Â To think this is only one of the types of extracurricular activities to choose from, doesn't it already seem worth your time?\nThe next option for an extracurricular activity is the academic workshops you're able to join. Academic workshops and clubs can push students to do better. In these academic workshops you surround yourself with people who want to be better, and are better than you. Surrounding yourself with people who are better than you encourages you to do better for yourself and pride. Academic workshops may also improve your grades a little or a lot depending on how dedicated you are to do so. There are workshops like homework club that help students who need a little more help and guidance than others. If these particular students participate in these types of things, they're sure to see and improvement anytime soon.\nLastly, there are so many different types of clubs any student could be a part of and interested in. Everybody should try something new every once in a while. The different clubs that schools have are the perfect opportunity. I'm going to introduce you to two of the clubs that sparked my interest. First is the yearbook club. Doesn't it just sound fun by its name? Wouldn't you want to be a part of the book that everyone raves about at the end of the year? You get to take pictures, make fun subtitles/caption, and so much more. Sometimes you even get extra credit for it. Seems like a deal breaker to me. Then there'sÂ student council. This is probably my favorite clubs to be a part of. It's very intriguing to see what it's like to be somewhat of a politician. Student council is also an awesome opportunity to show your teamwork and leadership skills strengthened by sports teams. Besides, wouldn't it be fun to basically be at the head of the school. Think about it, these are just two of the hundreds of clubs you're able to choose from.\nI believe every student should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity. Sports teams help push exercise, and strengthen teamwork and leadership. Academic workshops encourage better grades and motivates students to do better. There are also opportunities for student to try new things with the different types of clubs. Think of how well rounded a student would be by participating in one of these extracurricular activities every school year.Â",

        "From ballet to yearbook, there are many extracurricularÂ activities you can take part in, but there are more benefits that come with extracurricular activities thanÂ meets the eye. Some people don't do extracurricular activitiesÂ because of fear and uncertainty. Avoiding extracurricular activities can have a negative impact on your life. There are many benefits, long term and short term, to doing extracurricular activities. If extracurricular activities are made mandatory, it can help students overcome fears and find things they're passionate about. Making extracurricular activities compulsory for students will help them by creating new friendships, helping them get into collage and giving students new experiences.\nMaking extracurricular activities compulsory will help students make friends and build relationships. Engaging in extracurricularÂ activities will help students find people they have something in common with. For example, last year I was in the green eagles club and I met a lot of people I might not have hung out with otherwise. Going to clubs and after school activities will help student meet people they would not usually be friends with and help broaden your perspectives.\nMany students are shy and have a hard time making friends, but if extracurricularÂ activities are made mandatory it will help pull them out if their shells and develop social skills which are incredibly important throughout life. Having all student go to extracurricular activities will also introduce kids to many different types of people so that they have a better view of the world.\nEngaging in extracurricular activities can help you get into a good collage. While collages will look at your grades, they will also look at your extracurricular activities. Collages want not only smart people but also well rounded people who have many interests and will bring something to their school. When I asked my cousin, who goes to Generic_School, about when he applied for collage he said that collages will look at tons of people with good grades but what makes you stand out is your extracurricular activities and the extra things you do. Therefore, if it's mandatory for kids to do extracurricular activities, they will have a higher chance of getting into a good collage and this will help them in the long run.\nTaking part in extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ will give students new experiences. WhetherÂ it's being in an uncomfortable situation or just hanging out with your friends, your experiences are important because they are part of what shapes who you are as a person. If students take part in extracurricular activities, they might even find something they truly enjoy doing. Being in an extracurricular activity will expose students to other ideas and cultures which will in turn broaden their perspectives and make them more empathetic. When I was in sixth grade and I told one of my friends I was vegetarian, she said sorry, looking at me with pity. After a while she learned that I chose to be vegetarian, and that I enjoy it. This changed her perspective on what vegetarians are like and has made her more aware. When you expose kids to ideas, especially controversial ones, it helps them start to formulate their own opinions bases of of what they think and not what others tell them to think. It is very important that all people are exposed to others who are different to themselves and if all students take extracurricular activities, they will benefit through learning about their peers.\nBuilding relationships with people is an important skill that will be used throughout life and extracurricular activities will force students to be in positions where they will make friends. In the long run,Â extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ will help you in many ways such as getting you into a good collage which will eventually help you lead a good life. Taking extra curricular activities will make you a more well rounded and aware person and might even help you discover a passion. On top of this, by taking an extracurricular activity, students will gain new experiences which will broaden their perspectives. It is vital that students are exposed to other cultures and types of people because this will over all help to shape their out look on the world and make them more empathetic human beings. If extracurricular activities become mandatory, students will benefit because, they will make friends, it will help them get into collage, and give students new experiences.",

Your child may make the decision not to take part in a school activity, but your child should at least take one activity that your kid may enjoy. A student has already 35 hours each week learning about academics, but most of the academics don't teach the student confidence or leadership. There are thousands of different reasons why you should take your child to do an extracurricular activity, and these are some reasons why you must.\nTaking part in a school activity may teach various life lessons that a student may not already know. Life lessons aren't valued as much but it can teach people to do the right thing. For an example, serving in a student council can possibly change what people need, because the student learned how other students feel through bias.

        "Many school officials have been questioning whether or not students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities like sports, working on the yearbook, or serving in the student council can contribute a lot to a student's view on school. In addition to this, students will pay more attention to their grades and behavior. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is a great way for them to learn new things, get a break from learning all day, and get to socialize and make more friends.\nIn school, many students dislike to learn new things. By having one extracurricular activity, students will have a great way of learning new things. Sports are something we usually do during gym class, but in gym class at our school we move fast through any unit that we do.Â Having at least one extracurricular activity will give students a chance to enjoy participating in sports that they like. Also students will get to learn more about this sport and even later on join a team. There are a lot of creative students at my school. Students who want to learn about photography, drawing, and constructing things will have a great opportunity to by joining a extracurricular activity that involves this. I would like to add on that when I joined a drawing club, I learned many new things like blending colors. Additionally, training on your mindset is very important. By having a extracurricular activity like chess or board games, students will get to learn how to play board games that they have been wanting to try. Learning new things from extracurricular activities could be very helpful to students because later on they might have a chance to use this information.\nLearning all day can be very hard on some students. By joining a extracurricular activity, students will be able to have a break from learning all day. Many students by the end of the day are very tired after learning for so long. By participating in an extracurricular activity students will clear their mindset. In addition to this, having a break from learning can make students feel more relieved and they will pay more attention during class. If students decide to join extracurricular activities like drawing, they will be able to calm down. It has been a proven fact that drawing will make you calm down, so by doing a extracurricular activity, students will be at ease and contribute more during class. Learning all day is very stressful and takes a lot of energy, so therefore students should participate in calm and relaxing extracurricular activities that will give them a break from school and at the same time help them pay more attention toward school.\nSocializing is something that some shy students struggle with. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to make more friends and socialize. As a shy person, when I first came to my school I was struggling to find some good friends that I could trust. Later on I decided to join a chess club and a drawing club and I made great friends. Joining a extracurricular activity can give shy students a way to to train on socializing, meaning that they could practice how to socialize and even overcome their fear of socializing by talking to people in their extracurricular activity. At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there. Extracurricular activities are very helpful towards students who want to make some friends and socialize, so therefore making students participate in at least one is necessary.\nStudents should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is very helpful for them.

        "Close your eyes and imagine that it is your junior year in high school. You are sitting in a disorganized mess trying to figure out what to put on your college resume before the deadline, which happens to be in exactly two hours. This could have been prevented if you had actually done any extracurricular activities in the past. To prevent these types of scenarios, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can give them future opportunities, make them gain many skills, and help them find a passion to pursue.\nEveryone wants many opportunities in life, and extracurricular activities do just that. If you play an instrument, you can travel abroad to play your favorite pieces. You can join competitions and get recognized so that orchestras and symphonies ask you to play with them. It is not just playing an instrument that can get you opportunities, but sports too. If your team makes championships, you both can travel places for that competition. We cannot forget about college scouts either. If they see you play and they think you are good enough to be on their team, then they could give you a full-ride scholarship to their school. If that is not an amazing opportunity, then I don't know what is.\nThe next reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can learn many valuable skills they will need in the future. In leadership clubs like National Honor Society or your school's student council, you can learn how to communicate with people and get your ideas out. You can also learn to lead people, plan or organize events, and help your community. You can even overcome almost everyone's biggest fear, public speaking. That is definitely a huge benefit. With sports, you can also not only build up your communication skills, but also learn to collaborate by becoming a team player. If you are in a chess club, you can gain patience and critical thinking skills which will definitely help you in the future.\nThe last reason why all students should participate in extracurricular activities is so that they can find a passion to pursue. Sometimes, people do not always know what they want to do or become someday and extracurricularÂ activities just happen to help with that. By doing them, you can find out your interests and hobbies, what you are good and bad at, and what abilities you posses. If you love that sport or that instrument, pursue it! Work harder than anyone, and you just might find yourself in the Olympics. Practice with your whole heart and soul and next thing you know, you could be inviting your family to come see you perform with the National Symphony. The point is, all these passions can start from you just wanting to try out an activity.\nOverall, students should definitely participate in extracurricular activities. These activities can bring you many opportunities, valuable skills, and help you pursue a passion you never knew you had. There are so many more reasons to participate in extracurricular activities, but these are some of the most beneficial ones. If you had chosen any of the hundreds of extracurricular activities available, you would not be frantically trying to finish up your college resume two hours before it is due. Instead, you could have been stress free doing what you love the most.",

        "Many people participate in after school activities. Choosing to do so but some people prefer going home and resting after the long school day. But what if your principal said you have to participate in an extracurricular activity in order to go to this school. This may help you in many ways it could provide a way to talk and socialize with friends or make new ones. If it was a sport that involves any type of moving it would make you more fit and healthy. I would agree with the principals idea it introduces the kids to many things they have not done before and they might not of known they liked it or were good at it.\nThere are many benefits in extracurricular activities that you might not of known. Whether it would help you now or in the future. It is very healthy to participate in any activity because it can help you physically and even mentally improving your ability with your social skills in the result of you talking with your teammates or other people constantly. And how it can help you physically is in basically any sport you play. Your moving around constantly improving your endurance and strength it makes you more fit and healthy.\nWhile there are many advantages with this idea every idea comes with some disadvantages. But I have ways to counter them. Some people are not as fortunate as us and many sports have a fee to sign up as a result to that some families might not be able to afford that fee. So the school fills that gap from the cliff stopping that student from participating offering many activities that do not require a fee or any sort of paying. And if they do the school can fill that gap with the extra money they have, you can even donate to the school so the school can keep providing their students with the money they need in order to sign up.\nA lot of sports have practices almost every nightÂ and it might last until 9:00. So when you get home your exhausted and you don't feel like doing your homework or any project thats due soon. And its hard to find the time to do it. In the result of that the school makes the study halls or resources longer so you have time to finish your homework, essay, or school project. This will take the stress off of the students and let them sleep for a healthy amount of time instead of staying up late trying to finish that project.\nthe after school activity does not have to be a sport. It could be volunteering for school council or fightingÂ for the the best design of the yearbook. This also comes with a lot of benefits. Designing the year book is not an easy task trying to make the best possible one making you use your imagination as hard as you ever had making the most unique and creative one. So the judges would select yours as the winner. And volunteering for student council is just as hard to trying to satisfy all of the students needs and opinions making ideas that are mature but also good this makes you think out of the box and your comfort zone.\nOverall the principles Idea is a very good one that will improve the liveliness of the school. Making every student active is very important because it improves their mental health and physicall health. It will also help the students in the future providing scholarships for them to big colleges and programs. Making them feel more comfortable in front of bigger crowds. Students might not like the principles idea now but will thank him a couple years down the road.",

That's going to be hectic. It's also going to be super stressful. I disagree with this sudden change because, an abundance of kids here have personal issues, the high school doesn't have enough room, and some kids might not want to participate.\nYou never know what's happening in a person's life, unless they tell you about it. Someone might have to babysit their baby brother, until their mom comes home. Additionally, some kids that go to this school, their parents don't have a car. They probably take the bus, to and from work. So how are they going to get home after school? Exactly. So not everyone can play a sport or work on the yearbook. Some kids seriously don't have time for that. You have to be considerate of other people's problems.\nThe high school does not have enough room for every kid who wants to play a sport. I personally run track, and I love it. But there's already too many people on the team. I get that the high school has absolutely nothing to do with the middle school, but they control our afternoon sports. And what's the point of spending more money to hire more sport coaches for the middle school when we have some next door. That's a waste of money. So, if you just let the kids who are in 8th grade and want to try out for a sport, do their thing. We could all totally avoid being on a team with 60 people in it. Not to be rude or anything, but let's be honest.. Who actually wants to serve in the student council or work on the yearbook.\nWhen I say, \"\"some people might not actually want to participate.\"\" I'm referring to the lazy students. You can't actually force us to do anything after school hours. I'm totally sure that is illegal. However, if it's something related to homework, that's a totally different story. Not many people want to do anything after school. You may not see it, but a lot of students here are depressed. Please don't even try to say, \"\"an extracurricular might help them.\"\" It won't. They need to see their doctor, not you. Let us do what we want in our free time, that we legally don't have to be here at school. Y'all adults can work on the yearbook. And whoever wants to be on the student council, and whoever wanna play a sport. Let them, on their own free will.\nBasically what I'm saying is, everyone has a different POV/reason on why they do or don't do a extracurricular activity. You shouldn't force it on us because you want too, without reasoning. Be understanding and respectful of other people's time, and they might just thank you for it in the future. Â Â Â Â",

But while your playing with your friends, you are also exercising your body to participate in these activities.\nHealth is a key part to your life and you would be damaging your health if you just sit around, eating junk food, and watching TV. If you decide to take an activity where movement is involved, you will be able to incorporate a lot of exercise in your day. While you move, you are also exercising and losing calories. This could help you lose body fat, encourage you to do more activities to stay fit, or help you focus in school or your activity. Staying in good shape will open so many opprutunites for you to improve or succeed. If you get skilled enough with extracurricular activities, people could reward you with items or opportunities that could change your life for the better.\nSkills are a key component to become successful at school, your home or an extracurricular activity that you are taking. If you get skilled enough, people who notice you will be able to help you or reward you for the skill that you are good at. People like coaches, famous artists or singers could recruit you to an activity that could change your life. A student could be making a painting that is as good as the Mona Lisa, or a student could be so skilled that he could compete with famous basketball players like Lebron James or Kyrie Irving. This could all happen if a student were to take a extracurricular activity and put time into their activity.\nIn conclusion, mandatory extracurricular activities would be beneficial due to all of its opprutunites that it can offer. You could be the popular kid at school with all your new friends, be in good shape so that you can limit your chances of any health problems, or get recruited by people with amazing skills so that they can change your life for the better. Some students are not as motivated as they use to be. All they want to do is stare at their phones for excess hours or look for the best way to cause drama. Unless these students do extracurricular activities, they wont be a significant change and that is why it should be mandatory. They could miss out on something special, or never find their hidden talent. Extracurricular activities could change your life in many ways that you thought were impossible. If you put time into your activity, you never know what could happen, maybe you could be the next legend of your decade, or even century.",

      essay:
        "Should students really be forced to commit to an extracurricular activity for school? Many children are already committed to activities outside of school. School is very important, but students have lives outside of the school environment. When you commit to something you should put your best effort in to it, but if you are occupied with other things it is very hard to give it your all. The principal should not implement this rule because kids are given homework, they are committed to other activities outside of school, and spending time with your family is essential.\nMost children receive homework from teachers, and there is no doubt about that. Homework is important to better an understanding of a topic that is taught at school, but it can get very stressful at times. Most children spend sleepless nights trying to complete homework for the amount of classes they have. Children usually have an activity outside of school so adding that to the mix with all the homework can be hectic. It is way to much pressure to try to get good grades when there is so much to handle and you also have to remember the fact that we are kids that are still growing up.\nStudents are committed to other activities, teams, and programs outside of school. Would they have to quit doing that activity because they are just to stressed to handle it all? Schedules would not only shift for students but for the parents of those students. Aren't we supposed to get eight hours of sleep every night, but then how do us students do that when there is to much pressure placed on us? Teachers expect us to focus on the material they teach us at school, but that is going to be very difficult and I don't think teachers want to teach kids who don't want to be taught.\nSpending time with family is so important. We spend most of our days at school and doing other activities that it's nice to take a break. I mean if we have so many activities then that's taking away family time. I love my family and I know most kids do too, so I would like to spend as much time as I can with them. This is just one of the negative effects of having to do an extracurricular activity.\nAlthough, doing an activity is good I don't think that students should be forced to do one. It should ultimately be their choice because it can come with some negative effects. Homework, other activities, and spending time with your loved ones can be effected. The principal's rule is something I would not be here for, or would not think is the best call to make. All the stress that can come from the rule could be horrible and essentiallyÂ effect the performance that students do at school.Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Imagine having to take off work because the club you're in has to get together. You have to tell your mom you needed to sacrifice your work hours and won't make enough money to buy this week's groceries. By requiring kids to be apart of an extracurricular activity, difficluties similar to this start to emerge in their home life. I don't think schools should require kids to be apart of an extracurricular activity because not all kids can afford to be in one, parents are working and can't provide 2 transportation, and some kids are needed at their homes and can't leave to go to the activity.\nOne problem that shows requiring kids to be apart of an afterschool activity is not a smart choice is the fact that not everyone can afford to get the equipment needed for the activites. For example, if someone chooses to join the softball team, they would have to invest in softball cleats, a helment, shin guards, and much more supplies that were required to play. Sports equipment is not the cheapest, and not everyone has the means to pay for everything all at once. Also, a lot of clubs have a joining fee on top of all the equipment that's needed to be purchased, which doesn't make choosing an extracurricular any easier. Kids should be given the choice to join a club and if they choose to not join anything, that's their personal decision which deserves to be respected.\nAnother reason why joining an extracurricular activitiy should be optional is because a lot of parents are working and can't take the time off to drive their kid to club meetings or practices. There are other ways you could get to practice, like carpool or walking, but you can't put that type of pressure on somebody else's parent all the time and some people don't feel comfortable walking places. On top of that, parents don't always have extra money for gas and having to drive their kid to and from school more often than they normally would need to wastes a large amount of it. This is showing that it's hard for parents to have to drive their kid everywhere and it would be best to let kids decide if they can be apart of an extracurricular activty or not.\nLastly, every family has problems of some sort, some of which might require kids to be at their house as much as possible. For example, some kids have really young siblings that they have to watch as soon as they get back from school, which would take up all the time that they would spend at an afterschool activity. It's also possible that some families might be planning on moving houses soon and would need their kids to help them pack whenever they were avaliable. This would cause kids to have to be at home as much as they could and wouldn't leave any extra time to be in an afterschool activity. Being apart of an extracurricular activity is a decision made by kids and their parents and shouldn't be forced by anybody.\nIn conclusion, kids shouldn't be required to be apart of an extracurricular activity because it's very costly, it's hard for parents to provide transportation all of the time, and some kids are needed at their homes more often than not which gives them little or no free time. It wouldn't be fair for kids to be forced into doing something that would make their life harder, therefore schools should keep on giving them a choice.",

        'The principal decided to put everyone in an extracurricular class and the students disagree with this decision, if we take extracurricular activities they will be energy, wasting time, and a waste of money.\nExtracurricular activities are a waste of time, instead of being at a meeting for student council we could be home enjoying are families and friends while we can. These activities will just make it harder for us to wake up stable and functional for a new day at school especially sports. No one wants to stay three hours after school for a meeting with some other kids then have our parents pick us up. Those teachers/coaches also need to go home on time to get home to spend time with their families so keeping them here for extra hours is not the best idea.\nThese activities wont be cheap, the equipment for football, soccarball,baseball,basketball wont be cheap they will cost a lot of money. Football equipment will at leastÂ coat 10,000$ because of the gear that is bought every season and the 100 yard field that needs to be cleaned every month. Basketball equipment will probably cost the same because of the jerseys bought every season and the basketball court that is polished every week. Soccarball will not cost as much as football, because the only thing the school is buying is the jerseys and gear, they already have the football field to play on.\nBy the time we get home from these extracurricular activities we will be completely sore or completely tired and we need a good nights sleep to function, so why make us lose our good nights sleep just for an activity, We need to be able to wake up in the morning and say ""ahhhh another day"" and smile instead of "" dang it man school sucks"" and get mad. These activities will completely blow us out, make us not want to come to school, and deplete the energy right out of us. We need to come to school with a good attitude and good vibes not tired grouchy/grumpy, in conclusion the idea of the activities is good but the outcome is not, when we wake up the next day from the activity we will not be able to function at all, the school will just be wasting money ont these activities, and wasting other peoples time.',

        "I do agree with the principles decision on making every student take an extracurricular activity. Beacuse students should learn to do more things than just learn english or math or any subject like that, since it could help them be more active during school, it will also give them more opportunities after they finish school. Some students may not be as smart as others when it comes to learning in school but, that should not mean that they should not have as much of an opportunity to be as successful as others could be, so giving them a chance to see something that you might really be good at or just enjoy is great.\nOne extracurricular activity is playing a sport like soccer, football, basketball, or track. Students need to be as successful as possible when it comes to giving them the future some students can only depend on playing sports to be successful in life. Giving them the ability to play sports in school is an amazing decision beacuse it could have a lot more benifts then people excpect, some students are naturally born with a talent for basketball or football, or even drawing so making them choose an extracurricular activity, could have them discover something they never knew they could do.\nMany students do not have anything to do once they finish there school work, they may not have the money to buy a computer to play on or an xbox. By having them do an extracurricular activity like chess or something you are giving them the abilty to see other things they can do when they are bored. If a student took chess club as an extracurricular activity it could make them see how fun the game really is and have them convince there parents to buy them the chess game as a cheeper expense to keep them busy when they have nothing to do. I realize that some students may have disablititys that stop them from doing certain extracurricular activitys and thats why there are mulitiple activitys that you can do instead of doing just sports. Such as chess club, you can work on the yearbook, or you can serve as a student council.\nThat is why having every student take an extracurricular activty is benifical to the student. It can really help them learn to be more responsible, and open there train of thought which is always good for a student, or even just give them something to do when they are bored.",

        "Sports and extracurricular activities are very common in today's schools, yet in recent years the number of students who participate in these has diminished.Â One of the few top causes are, technology, lack of drive, and higher levels of stress.Â Therefore I feel, that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity to, aid in finding peers with similar interest, be stress beneficial, and drive students with the enticement of competition.\nFirst and foremost, this will aid in finding peers with similar interest because, we are more often than not, on social media or are on our phones more intrigued in what somebody else is doing, or where they are going than what we are doing with their own lives.Â A prime example of this, is that people won't sign up for something they don't like.Â So people in chess club most likely want to be there, that is something everyone there has in common.Â Plus if we participate in multiple clubs or activities and the same people are in them to, they probably have similar interest that could lead to companionship.Â With this added benefit of friendship it opens a whole new door of opportunities for us.Â It means that we can have someone there for support or someone to go hangout with in the future.Â It can also drive us to take more risk in our life and open us to new opportunities like a new food or activity that we may enjoy.\nSecondly, a lot of students, especially in late middle to high school, are under a exponential amount of stress.Â This can cause them to do are think about harmful or life threatening activities to them or others.Â To prevent this, it would be wise for us to be in a place where we can express ourselves and let off some steam. Extracurricular activities fulfill this need for relief in our lives, and A few of the ways it does this is exposure to the community by, travel, community service, or self influence in the community.Â Another benefit is time management, many students, my self included, struggle with time management because we are constantly over run by massive a amount of knowledge from the day or week, so that leads us to give to much or little time to self benefit.Â This leads to higher levels of stress when we don't have time to do anything on the spot.Â I have first hand experience with this where just the other day I came home after a long and dreadful day where I was to tired to do anything so I simply fell asleep even though I had plans to go with my friends that evening, but was famished of energy from school.\nLastly, it opens up a window of opportunity when it comes to competition.Â As human beings we strive to be the best in life. We want to have, the style, the smarts, and the popularity in life.Â With that said, clubs and sports allow for that through competition.Â For some they get to express their leadership skills, for others they get to home in on their teamwork skills and on the very rare occasion it teaches some to be humble with loss.Â Competition gives a sense of unity with each other because everyone is working toward the same goal, winning, and it can also build confidence though leadership.Â A good example is a sport coach, in some sports one of the players is actually the coach, and having that job is often a way to build confidence because it gives a sense of power to them.Â Even losing can help them, for some they feel that winning is the only thing in life so they get all worked up about it. So when they lose and understand that its not a bad thing. It helps them learn not to be so stressed about winning, and I used to be that way, but because I learned that I can lose and it won't kill me, I have enjoyed life more.\nIn conclusion, I feel that having us participate in a extracurricular activity is a highly beneficial idea that will allow for us to enjoy life with a higher acceptance. It will let us make more friends with similar interest, allow for us to be less stressed in life, and give us a higher sense of confidence in life. All of this leads to the fact of enjoying life to the fullest and sharing that with others instead of being secluded and stressed in life which is where a lot of the student population is right now in comparison to a couple of decades ago.",

        "A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricularÂ have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.\nOne reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my gradeÂ that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.\nFurthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after schoolÂ club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.\nTherefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after schoolÂ to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high schoolÂ early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.\nStudents making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new.Â Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life. Â Â Â Â",

Participating in extracurricular activities has many factors and I agree with the decision of having all students participate in an activity. There are many pros to having everyone participate because there are many different activities you can participate in also you can learn important lessons and skills also participating in an activity keeps you occupied.\nOne of the reasons i agree is because there are many different activities to choose from so everyone can find something they enjoy doing. If you enjoy playing sports joining a sports team at your school would be a good a way for you to stay active and create great friendships and bonds with people you play with. There are many different clubs you could join too, If you like taking pictures and being involved around the school working on the yearbook would be a good extracurricular choice for you. If you like making a change or you see a problem at your school joining the school council would be a good way to help your school out and make a change. As I have stated there are many different activities you could participate in so you could always find something you enjoy.\nHaving kids participate in extracurricular activities can also help you learn many important lessons and skills. Joining an activity can help you become more responsible because when your participating in an activity you have to make sure you stay on task also you have to make sure you are on time and do what your supposed to do. If you follow the rules and tasks you are given, this can help you become more responsible as you get older. You also learn how to make friendships. Having every kid participate in an activity helps people make friendships and talk to other people. This is a good way to interact with others and you can use this skill as you get older. Another important skill you learn is communication. In everyÂ activity communication is a big key to being successful in what you do because if your working with other people you need to make sure you understand whats happening and what you need to do so you need communication. As I have stated these are some important lessons and skills you can learn while joining a extracurricular activity.\nParticipating in an activity also helps you stay occupied and busy. Some activities take place after school so instead of staying home and sitting on your phone or watching TV you get to participate in an activity which gets you up and moving. Also being in an activity keeps you active because if your playing a sport or in a club where exerciseÂ is involved that keeps you moving and healthy. Another pro is that sometimes being in activities can be a distraction for you and help you get out of trouble because instead of going somewhere with your friends that can possibly get you in trouble you are doing something productive and good. As I have listed being in an extracurricular activityÂ is a good way to stay occupied and get good things done.\nAs I have stated these are some of the reasons I think its a good idea for everyone to participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many different activities for people to participate in also you can learn important skills and lessons also participating keeps you occupied. I hope my reasons convinced you that everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea and many good things come out of joining one. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "If a principle were to make all kids participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, what would kids and parents think? It could quite possibly go either way, a hit or a miss.\nMost of the kids that go to school are antisocial, and what most extracurricular activities are about is communicating, for example, running a play in football, calling for the ball in basketball, talking to other kids in the student council. And that's most definitely not fair to the kids who are not very sociable. Besides, you also have to try out for sports, so if you happened to not make the team, your stuck with something you don't like.\nAlthough some students may not be sociable, this rule could open some new doors for them, finding a new passion, or something they do in a extracurricular activities might just be their job when they get older.\nParents may also get very involved as well, everybody knows that if a parent sees their child unhappy, they'll do everything in there power to stop or put and end to it. And I personally don't think that schools want a swarm of angry parents trying to change some tiny rule.\nBecause no matter where you go, visit, or travel everybody'sÂ different! The world is a very diverse and unique place, full of humans with all sorts of different opinions and views. So you shouldn't force rules that make people unhappy. extracurricular activities should be a fun, option you can choose, not something you must follow.",

Yes I do, you see, there are a lotÂ of things you can do as a extracurricular activity maybe you can join your schools sports teams like Baseball, Soccer, Football, or even Track and Field. The point I'm getting at is there are a lotÂ of opportunities you can have with extracurricular activities. Don't like sports or dont want to move around to much?\nDon't worry, there are plenty of other things you can do. Maybe you like photography you can join the Yearbook club or the Earths Wonders club. Want to help the environment and help clean up trash on the streets and roads? you can join the Better Tomorrow club. Dont worry though there are a lot more things you can do like maybe you are a creative person and like to paint, sketch, or draw. You may like the Art club full of great artists.\nThere is also a lot of musical opportunities such as Choir, and Band. In Choir you will be able to sing to your hearts content, go on trips, and sing in concerts. Maybe you dont like to sing you may like band. Band is a purely instrumental group composed of Brass, Percussion, Woodwind, and even Strings. If you like to make music, those are your best choices.\nDon't like music and instead like to read. Our Book club might interest you. Just come on down to the library after school and talk about books you like to read. Thats not all though, there are also clubs for TV watchers as well. There is a anime club that talks all things Anime, and a Netflix club as well. If you like watching TV come on down to the Netflix club or Anime club.\nIf none of that sounds enjoyable or maybe cooking is your calling, our school holds a Culinary Arts club to help students learn and master the art of cooking.\nlastly, there is the Teachers For Tomorrow, a group of students willing to teach the next generation of students. We also hold a EthicalÂ Hacking and Computer skills class for those who like technology. There are so many clubs you can join and enjoy at read mountain, for information please ask one of our secretaries in the front office and they will give you a information slip of all the clubs and there meeting places.

        "Say your principle has made a new rule this year that you must participate in a minimum of one after school activity. This means it will force kids to take action and try something new with a extracurricular activity. I hope my school does this because it will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.\nMy first reason why this would be a good idea is because students will make new friends. We all know there are some of those kids that are anti social and do not like to talk to that many people. But if you force them to do an after school activity, they will make new friends in that program. This can make their self esteem rise as their circle of friends grows. Even if you are not one of those anti social people, you can still meet many different types of people annd make cool friends. If you are taking the same after school activity, that mean you guys both like that same thing. This will make it even easier to meet new people that share your interests.\nMy second reason why this would be a good decision by your principle is because it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer. By some peoples senior year, there may be some seniors that took so many after school activities, that the school loves them because it shows how much they want to learn and get involved. You may get an award at graduation or some recongnition for participating in so many extracurricular activities. I know someone who does a sport, works on the yearbook, and is on the debate team. This shows they want to learn and is a good sign for the teachers at the school. This represents to teachers that he is a well rounded student. Most extracurricular activites also go on your high school trans script. This means colleges will see you were involved with many programs at your high school and it will strengthen your chance to get into better colleges.\nMy third and final reason why this rule should be added by your principal is because it is something new to try. Maybe you have never even thought about going on the debate team because you thought you would never like that. You try it anyways because of this new rule and you turn out to be really good at it and now you have a new hobby. With this new rule forcing students to take part in extracurricular activities, it can expand someones personality by trying things they would never have tried before. It is always good to try new things because it can give you an idea of things that you like and do not like. By trying new things out in after school activities, it will help shape what you want to do with your life as you go through high school.\nThere are really no bad things that can happen with after school activities. You may get stuck in something that you do not like that much, but that is just practicing perserverance and determination. hope my principle will add this new rule forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.",

        "Have you ever come home from school and been bored, because you have nothing to do? Fortunately enough for you, there are tons of extracurricular activities available. I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first reason I believe this, is that students are able to try a new activity and meet new people. In addition to that, students can learn teamwork and make friends from an extracurricular. Finally, students participating in an extracurricular learn how to balance school work on on top of their activity.\nWhen students try new activities, they can discover things about themselves and new people with common interests. Students may discover a talent or interest in something that they never knew they had. For example, if a person has never kicked a soccer ball, then they will not know whether they're good at it or they like it. Furthermore, even if students come to find that they don't like their extracurricular, they can still use this experience in the future. Just like when a person tries a new food, if that individual doesn't like it, then they will remember. The students can then use their knowledge to avoid what they don't like in the future. Last, it is beneficial to try a new activity, because you may meet someone you don't know who has similar interests to yours. Meeting these new people with common interests can lead to new friendships, that never would have happened. Trying a new extracurricular allows students to learn more about themselves and meet new people.\nParticipating in group activities is very important to students. For example, teamwork can be learned by practicing and working with a team in an extracurricular. In an extracurricular it is crucial that team members trust, rely, and work with each other to achieve the common goal. Secondly, using this teamwork to collaborate and accomplish goals, can lead to new friendships. When a student learns to trust and work with a team member within a extracurricular, they can also trust and collaborate with that person outside of the extracurricular. Last but not least, being able to work in a group is a very important skill that people look for when they are hiring for jobs. Companies look for teamwork in their employees, because co-workers need to be able to collaborate and respect each other to do their jobs efficiently. Activities that schools offer teach an important lesson about teamwork, that can create new friendships and be used outside of school.\nPartaking in an extracurricular and school at the same time has many benefits. The first of those being, that participating in an activity and school at the same time teaches students the manage their time. Adding an extracurricular on top of schoolwork can only be done if the student learns to use all of their time wisely. This time management allows a person to do more things they love to do. If a person can be efficient and not procrastinate on things they have to do, they will have leftover time to do whatever they want. The final reason a student should attend school and do an extracurricular, is that time managementÂ is a necessary life skill that students must learn. In the future students may need to balance a family, work, and make time for themselves all at the same time. Participating in school and an extracurricular teaches students a valuable life lesson about time management, that can allow these students to do what they love.\nI think that all students in school must partake in at least one extracurricular. I think this, because students can get new experiences and meet new people, while trying a new activity. Not only that, activities students participate in can teach teamwork that can lead to new friendships. My last reason for believing this is that, taking part in school and extracurricular activities gives students a lesson about how to manage time wisely. I believe that all schools should require students to partake in an extracurricular.",

        "Do you wanna be successful in every aspect of your life? Well I believe that it would be a great idea to have every students participate in a extracurricular activity. Because one it would keep every student focused on something positive. Second it could help them get into college or get a good job. Not to mention it could give them learning experiences and keep them out of trouble.\nOne reason I believe that it would be a good idea is because it would keep students focused on something. For example if a kid decides to try out a sport they could fall in love with it so they work hard at it. So not only could they put that work ethic in the sport they could also put it in the classroom. This can also ready students for the work world when you have to be motivated to do stuff.\nAnother benefit of every kid doing a extra activity is that it could help get them into a college. Like if you do volunteering at an old folks home that could help out a lot. Or if you did something like charity work. playing sports can also help you get into a good college. Not only could that help with getting in college but also help you get a job, etc.\nAlso if you do activities it can help you stay out of trouble. EspeciallyÂ if your a kid that does get in trouble a lot this can help you eliminate bad influences , distractions, etc. it can also give you good learning experiences. So if you have an activity going on it will help you greatly with staying out of trouble.\nTo conclude I think extra curricular activities would be very positive for students. It could help your work ethic. It can help you focus your time and every in to something positive. Help you with getting into college or a job. It can also help you stay out of trouble.",

        "What do you like to do after school? The answer is probably go home and relax. But wouldn't it be great if everyone did an extracurricular activity. Their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day. I think kids should have to do extracurricular activities because you make new friends, you help out your school, and it creates other opportunities.\nWhile doing extracurricular activities you can make new friends. Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.\nSome extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot. It may be in a small way but it still helps. Groups that make the yearbook or students that serve on the student council are helping the school out. They are helping to keep the school in order and to keep students happy. Other extracurricular activitiesÂ like football and basketball help their school and community by winning games this helps the school make money, it helps the community by providing entertainment. Some schools even have environmental clubs that help the school, the community, and even the world. All in all, extracurricular activities help the school and community.\nMost importantly extra curricular activities create more opportunities. When doing extracurricular activitiesÂ you might find out that you are really good at something. People that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college. You might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing. Also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college. ExtracurricularÂ activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding.\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities have a lot of benefits. They can help you make friends, help your school and community, and create new opportunities. People may not want to do extracurricular activities but it will help you out later on in life and you will have plenty of fun.Â",

        "I joined a extracurricular activity and made a lot of friends in the process, 1 of myÂ best friends is actually someone i met during a extracurricular activity, his name is Generic_Name and we met through football. I agree with having students being in a extracurricular activity because you make more friends, become more social with better communication skills, and you might find a activity that you like to do.\nOne of the reasons why I think it's good for people to have more friends is so you dont have to deal with loneliness. Being lonely is something that no one wants to go through. You might have a great personality or a really cool talent, but no one is willing try and get to know you. Nobody wants to sit at the lunch table by themselves, or have a class with no friends in it either. And also people want to be known as the \"\"cool kid\"\" or something of that nature, which isn't a bad idea. But if you make friends with people who act just like you then that'llÂ be a lot better than hanging out with the cool kids.\nAnother reason on why its good to have friends is so school isn't as boring. Walking around in the halls by yourself, sitting in a class with no friends, or jogging in P.E. by yourself is boring. If you have friends then he or she will invite you out to do stuff, so it also makes life at home more fun.\nmy last reason on why it is good to have friends is because a good friend can make your day a lotÂ better. If your team just lost the championship and your sad then hanging out with your best friend might not be a bad idea. Or if something is bothering you then a friend can tell when something is wrong with you,and he or she will try to make you feel better or if they have to leave you alone then they will. A good friend should want the best for you,they should make you feel happy. However, if a friend is always putting you down, making you sad, or can't make you feel good about yourself, then that person isn't a good friend.\nSome of the reasons why i think having good communication skills and being more social is good is so making newÂ friends isn't hard for you. If you have bad communication skills then making new friends might not be easy for you. And since your not that good you might not even try to make new friends because you might not even try to make new friends because you probably think that you might come off as weird, and you wont get that personÂ to be your friend. But if you participate in a after school activity then your social skills will grow, and you will also know how to talk to different kinds of people.\nLastly, i think its good to be social and good at communicating in the real world. In the real world you will most likely be working with someone else. If your a doctor, do sports, or something along the lines of working with other people, then having good communication skills would make your job easier. If you have bad communication then your job will beÂ harder and you might not like it as much because of the people you work with.\nMy final reason on why iÂ think students should participate in a after school activity is because if they find something they like to do. If a student is doesÂ a sport like basketball and he or she likes it, then that person might want to play basketball something around that topic. Maybe they dont want to be a basketball player but instead a coach or a physical trainer. Or maybe they just want to be in shape so that their body can do a physical activityÂ at its full potential.\nJoining a after school activity doesnt seem so bad, i think theirs a lot more benefits if you do it than if you dont. Meeting new people,making new friends, being more social, and communicating better with others seems like you have a lot to gain.\nMy reasons for why the school should put kids in a extracurricularÂ activity are making new friends,have better social and communication skills, and they might find a activity that they like, i agree that the principal should enforce this rule and i hope i could convince other people to support my opinion.",

My reasons on students dont have to do a activity because some students might have anxiety, work around the house, or homework. Some students might have anxiety because they probably been bullied by classmates and other times they probably grew up in a rough life. Some students do work around the house like some kids live in a farm and they have to take care of animals, and some kids might babysit their siblings. The principal dont know some of the kids went through in their life. For instance, some kids probably got abused, homeless, and foster care. So the principal should ask about how they feel about they feel about the changes of the school activities. Most students dont like sports because coaches push them a lotÂ or there not interested. When a student is behind in school and they have to make up work it takes them time. Some kids dont have time for yearbook or student council. People dont like yearbook clubs because they have to work on a page and it takes days to finish. Some students cant do student council because they cant behave, focus, and be responsible. I have few more thoughts. When it comes to sports parents dont allow there child to eligible to play any sports like football because the injuries, concussions, and even deaths. Students might have body issues for sports like leukemia, and schlolisosis. So I think students doesnt have to do at least one after school activity. Some students dont have the grades to be eligible for a sport like they have 3 F's. Finally some students have to do other sports out of school like wrestling and the gym.

I agree with the principal because kids need to get out and make new friends, learn how to work with others and do better in school.\nOne reason, to make friends can help you because you will see life in there or a different way. You can learn new things about them. Let's say you guys are playing basketball an one of the boys did a lay up, you can teach or show them a different type of move they can do in basketball like how to shoot when you are 6ft away from the net and not miss. It can help prove your low self stream and help you become brave or bold because you know that your friends will have your back.Â There was this one thing when my school sister(friend) cyan had my back when there was people picking on me about my shoes in 7th grade she told them to leave me alone and you are so mean and rude. From that day on we are still the best of friends/ school sister.\nFor an example, you can learn how to work with others. Learn from other people can teach you new things.\nLike cooking someone can show you or teach you they recipes and you can do the same. A lotÂ of people have a different ways of see things like in photographer you have one way ofÂ seem one thing and someone else can see a another way, but if you can put or come together with both ideas you guys can both make a amazing picture. Work together mean there will have to be teamwork like everyone has a job to do to get the work done and they can feel like the are part of this team.\nFinally, do better in school. Extracurricular activity can help you in school because some of this activity you will need to have good grades in your classes in order to be there.

      essay:
        "I believe after-school activities should be a requirement made by every school across America. After-school activities have proven to help students with a variety of things in their school years. For example, students get easily recognized by various amounts of colleges for the activity they are doing. Another reason is it helps students make friends with people who enjoy the same things as them. Last but not least, it also allows students to experience something new and prepare them for the future. If my principal were to make my friends and I to do an extracurricular activity, I would agree to it. It is something to do and it is enjoyable. I think students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it helps students get noticed by colleges, it gives them a chance to make friends, and it gives them preparation for the future.\nFirstly, after-school activities give students a chance to get watched by colleges. Extracurricular activities are one of the main things colleges look for. For example, my brother signed up for\nB-Tech to do engineering. After hearing about it,\nVirginia Tech started watching him and has invited him to their campus plenty of times. Along with getting noticed, students also have a chance of getting scholarships. Scholarships are a huge deal to many kids and teens who want to go to college. Although earning a scholarship is like getting into\nThe Olympics , it is still possible and it doesn't hurt to try. Scholaships have been helpful to many athletes and doctors throughout the years, so why wouldn't they be helpful to the kids who want to succeed as well? After all, it can be helpful to anyone, and perhaps a student is striving to earn one right now.\nAnother reason students should join an activity is it helps them make friends. Making friends in an environment students enjoy is the easiest way to make friends. The students who are in the same activity probably enjoy some of the same things as the other kids around them, making it easier to converse with them. It also teaches students to be more outgoing, which can help them with future problems, like speaking up. Students can be more comfortable and confident around kids just like them. Even if kids don't want to make new friends, they can join a club with their current friends and spend more time with them. Having friends within the activity can prevent the activity from being boring. Lastly, not only can it help students make friends in the activity, but it shows that the students involved might be interested in something other kids might have notÂ expected from them. This makes them more attractive, enjoyable, and unpredictable, which are characteristics that help attract friends.\nAlong with the other reasons, activities can help prepare students for the future. These activities require time management, which is something many kids don't understand or haven't learned. Time management is helpful for the future when students get jobs and need to work out hours with their boss. It not only helps with time management, but what students want to do in the future as well. Students aren't prone to enjoy the first club they try or even the fifth, but it can help them find a new hobby. A new hobby may not seem like a big deal, but it can end up being what the student wants to do in the future and go to college for. It also trains them for that profession they want to succeed in. High schools have the availability of many different clubs and activities, so why not try them? Students have the capability of joining something, and if they don't like it, at least they tried it and now they know not to do it later in life.\nIn conclusion, I believe students should join a club or an after school activity. It helps with many things the students may need in the future or strive for later in life. Kids who have the ability to join something that may change their life should join whatever might impact them and their future. Even if they might not see it, it helps them a long way into the future and opens up opportunities that might not be available to every child. Students should join activities and clubs whether they are required or not. It has so many benefits, I don't see why students shouldn't join. They can make friends, get noticed by colleges, find new hobbies, prepare for the future, and so much more. Overall, students can find success by just trying something they may have never before. Something that may seem like a simple activity or a \"\"hang-out\"\" can turn into something so much more.Â",

        "Have you ever been forced to do something that you did not want to do? Like a sport or some type of activity? Well the principal has decided that now on you have to be taking an extracurricular activity and I think that idea is terrible and disagree with his decision and here are my three main reasons. First what if the students parents can not help there kid with anything involving the activity. Secondly, the students may not have enough time for the activity. Thirdly, students may not like any of the activities.\nFirst lets talk about how parents can't get involved/or help with the activity at all. Like what if the activity fee is to much and the students parents can not afford it. Or there parents could be working later than usual and there not able to pick you up from the activity because there to busy with work. Also what if your parents are at home watching other siblings how are they gonna drop/pick you up. Or even what if they stayed home sick and there not feeling good who's going to pick them up or drop them off. And what if there exhausted from a big day of work and don't feel likeÂ getting up or moving because there to tired. Finally what if there injured and can't get out of bed then who's gonna pick or drop of the kids because they obviously can't.\nNext lets talk about students not having enough time for the activity because they have stuff to do. Like they have a lot of HW they have to do or catch up on. Or there going to another siblings activity because they can't stay home alone. Also they may have to stay home and watch younger siblings because they can't be left home alone without someone. Or even what if they planned with a couple of friends to hangout that day and go do something fun. And what if there parents have a lot of chores planned for them and there not able to finish because they have to go to the activity. Finally what if they do other activities outside of school like a sport or a club.\nFinally lets talk about how the students may not like any of the activities the school has and what it could cause. Like the students could get mad that there being forced to do something they do not wanna do. Or they could develop a bad relationship with there parents because they feel like there parents are forcing them to do it. Also they might get so bored they will just end up skipping the activity instead of going to it. Or even there behavior could change in a bad way making them mean, naughty, and disrespectful. And they could start developing depression because there being forced to do something they do not want to do which can build up depression/anger/sadness. Finally they could get really bored of the activity and keep misbehaving.\nThis is why forcing kids to do something they don't want to do/or can't do is bad. Because it can lead up to a lot of bad things in a students life and a very few good things. So I think these activities should be optional so you do not have to deal with your parents not being able to help you with anything involving the activity, or not having enough time to do the activity, and not having any activities you like. So if they were optional it would create not as much stress on the students and parents so not everyone is freaking out.",

        "Imagine having to stay after school for an activity you don't enjoy. Students spend seven long hours learning each day and the last thing they want to do is stay at school longer. Most students want to relax after a tiring day of learning. I don't think students should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity.\nStaying after school for a sport, club, or even student council will take away time with family, make expenses to maintain the school after hours rise, and give students less time to complete homework or attend other commitments.\nSpending time with family is important and much needed. If students are forced to stay after school then they're taking away valuable time to be with family. When students are done learning everyone should be able to go home to see their family. A lotÂ of people like to eat dinner together and it would be hard if your kid is having to stay after school for an activity. Adding extra time spent after school can mess up a families plans for the night which isn't fair.\nMaintaining the school for seven hours a day is hard enough. Adding at leastÂ an hour of the school operating each day increases the money spent onÂ heat, air conditioning, and electricity. Each day one hundred dollars is spent on just electricity for the building. Adding fifteen dollars to each day for electricity will add up. Heat and air conditioning is way more expensive than you think. The school spends around five hundred dollars each week towards keeping the school comfortable. Having extracurricular activities will require that amount to rise.\nMajority of students have something to do after school whether it's homework or other commitments. Teachers normally require homework to practice the skills students learn in class. If after school activities are required then homework will have less time to be completed. When there is a small time frame for assignments, students will get stressed and not do their best work. Most kids have a sport or music lesson they attend after school although, the after school activity may get in the way by making the kid late or tired.\nAlthough extracurricular activities may help students get involved with the school, there are many reasons why this is not a good idea. I think the principal should not follow through with this proposal because there could be a lotÂ of negative effects. Taking away time to be with family, more expenses for maintaining the school, and giving less time for homework and other commitments are just three of the many negatives. Forcing students to do something they don't want to after learning hours is not fair. Students and teachers need to spend the afternoon hours at home relaxing not at school.Â",

        "I believe that all students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they dont want to. They should be able to do what they want and not forced to do extra things, now if some students want to participate in some of the activities they can but others should not be forced to. Most students like there free time in school and not forced to do something to make them give up that free time, others may want to do the activities which is fine but others shouldÂ not be forced to do the activities, and students may not find any of the extracurricular activities fun or interesting so which they may not find fun in doing.\nFirst of all, students like there free time. Should they really give that up for something they dont want to do? If a student has free time in school they would like to enjoy it, not have to spend time doing something they did not want to do most all forced to do. Free time in school for students is like having a day off, they have time to chill and take a breather from work and many other things. If the students free time was taken away do to a extracurricular activate they would be really mad and frustrated students. Why would you want to take that away from the students, it is one of the only things enjoyable for them.\nSecond of all, some students may want to do that activate but others just dont want to. Now if some students would want to participate in the activities they may but forcing another to do it is not right. the students should have a choice if they want to or if they dont, if they want to they can if not its OK and they cant or should not be forced to. People dont like to be forced to do an extracurricular activities if they are doing just fine.\nFinally, what if the students do not find any of the activities fun or enjoyable? Do you really want to make some body do something they dont enjoy or find fun in at all? If they dont find fun in the activity they wont do it and may end up failing the extracurricularÂ activity they were forced to do. So if they cant find fun in it why should they have to do it. Many others may want to do something else that is fun and enjoyable and not forced.\nNow if that is not enough to change your mind on having to make them do an activity that they loose free time, that some may want to do but others dont, and finally may not find any fun or interest in, then i dont have any thing else for you then. You should not have to make anyone do anything if they dont want to. after all they are human beings they should be able to do what they want.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "I live in the middle of nowhere. Deep in the woods on a small gravel road in a town most people have never heard of. In fact I dont live in the same town as my school. A little bus picks me up at exactly 8:20 am and hustles down my pothole-filled road into the next town over, just in time for the bell. But not all kids live like I do. Many can walk to their school in 2 minuets tops. We both come to school for the same amount of time, and then go back to our homes. Now, who's to say that we both aren't busy? Homework, family, other hobbies and activities that take up the rest of daylight. Busy with something that won't always involve school. Now, the prinicple has decided that all students are required to participate in at least one extracirricular activity. Who has the time for that? Student's should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.\nOne of my favorite hobbies is singing. I take lessons every week, and I preform in little shows in the spring and fall. I have lessons on Tuesday and Thursday, from 6 to 7pm. I get home about 7:30, and then I go to sleep. I use the couple of hours before hand to finish homework and eat dinner. My day is busy from sunrise to sunset. Now, there are other kids whos days end at 10:30pm. Some play a sport, and those practices last hours . Others are in theater, and I know from experience that play practice NEVER ends. We simply have no time in the day for an extracurricular activity. But not everyone is fortunate enough to have after school hobbies and play sports.\nI live quite literally in the middle of nowhere. I can recall more times than not when my friends tell me that their parent's wont pick me up because of where I live. My mom travels a lot for her work, and my dad lives cities away. My brother's babysitter can barely get him into the car in time to drive me to singing lessons. His tantrums are a melody within itself. I am lucky that I am able to be driven to my lessons, but not everyone is given that luxury. Some teenagers are home alone until their parents get back late at night, others just aren't allowed to leave their house. One of my closest friends lives in the heart of her town, but her parents wont let her walk anywhere unless it is to or from school. Everyone's families are different. Not everyone has a stay-at-home mom to drive them places, or the gas money for it. Unless the school wants to send a bus or reimburse the families who have to pick their kids up from these required activities, we might just have to stay at home.\nSpeaking of home life, what about our families? I have two younger brothers, one with a disability. I have spent more weekends then i'd like to admit watching my brothers, and many evenings when the babysitter has to leave earlier than my mom get home. Other kids watch their siblings the minute they get home from school, becuase their parents can't afford or don't trust a babysitter. And not all of us get paid to do it. I sure don't. It's \"\"part of my responsibility as the oldest.\"\" It sucks. But I know my mom works hard, and family is more important than an after schoolÂ activity. I have friends who are the youngest, and do whatever they please. I know other people who cook dinner and clean the house for their parents and younger siblings. It's just how the cookie crumbles. Lots of kids just do not have the capabilities to participate in these extracirricular activites.\nWhat about the kids who play video games, or do nothing but sleep when they get home? Some of them walk home from school everyday, and do as they please. I can think of one person in seconds who lives a life like that. I call them up after schoolÂ and they're playing on their X box. I personally don't see the hype about video games, but then again, I prefer gardening and writing stories. Video gamesÂ and the internet in general are a topic of controversy and speculation everyday, and it plays a major role in the modern generation. But who's to say it's all bad? Besides, us kids go to school 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 180 days per school year. We need a break! Homework bleeds into home life, and many of us are quite busy in the after schoolÂ category. Kids who play video gamesÂ or simply sleep after schoolÂ need those little bursts of joy in their week. Some kids stay up late completing homework that is too overwhelming or difficult for them to finish quickly. We need more than 8 hours of sleep, and many teenagers get less than that everyday. The trend of 8 hours of sleep was actually created by a company in an advertisement, not by a study done by scientists. It was advertised to promote 9-5 jobs, and eventually became a lifestyle in the United States. We're still kids, and we still need as much sleep as infants. Our society hasn't seen the potential our generation has because we're constantly drained. Adding an extracurricular activity isn't going help.\nOverall, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. Some adults may not realize it but us teenagers have our own lives too! I like hanging out with friends and sleeping in on weekends, and that doesn't make me lazy. Us students are too busy, too tired, and too involved in our families for more activities. Some of us don't have the facilities for it either. There is simply not enough time. Which is ironic considering we live with a calendar that has 365 days.\nAt the end of the day, every kid does their best, and it puts a lot of stress on teenagers. 14, 15, and 16 year old kids are being given work most adults can't handle. We're treated like little kids, yet expected to behave and act like adults. Everyday asks a lot from us, and we try. We deserve time away from school. We deserve time for ourselves. So let us have it.",

        "Did you know that the human touch is very important to the human brain? Human touch lets the brain know that you're still alive and breathing. It will let the brain know that their body will always be okay and that they are in safe hands. Without human touch, you or anyone else, could die. Students may experience enormous mental health problems but they should at least try to participate because students will become healthier through human interactions and they can use these activities for future references.\nAny student can become healthier through small activities, here's why. These kids will become more social with eachother and they may end up making friends. Even if this activity requires the tiniest conversation, the brain is becoming more active and is not being isolated in it's own thoughts. Students will come in contact with sports through this process. Sports would be a great way to become healthy. A body requires physical exersize, this will help with the vitamins that your body needs throughout the years. Students will be able to think in a more imaginative way. This opens another part of your brain which may have never been used before. This will help you imagine fun things for a \"\"get away\"\" space!

Students will have more experience if a future problem gets in their way. The, now grown up, student can reference their past extracurricular activity. They will be able to think more clearly and will be able to get passed their real life problem. Students can use certain extracurricular activities for community service projects. In their future, community service will be very important to college applications. They can use these hours as an example for this future application. Students can think back to their activity and think about the good times that they might have had there. This will make them smile at the eperience they had in high school. It will leave a perminant smile on their face whenever they think of their school. Everyone will have fun yet different scenarios they can look back on and use for future references.\nSome kids might have a spiraling and out of control mental health situation. If that is a big problem, then they should not have to do the extracurricular activity. Anything having to do with mental to physical pain should be taken seriously at all times. The smallest thing may be able to tigger this emotion. If this student wants to do an activity, you should let them! Anyone with mental health and physical pain issues can try new things which includes after school activities, just take things a bit slow and see how it goes!\nStudents may experience mental health issues but you should at least let them try to participate because, these students will become healthier and they will have this for future references!

Though you may be busy, extracurricular activities can help you make new friends, stay active, and makes you use your time wisely.\nEver have trouble connecting with people? When you join a after-school activity, your group all have that one thing in common, which is a great place to start. Like in the first paragraph; maybe it's lacrosse. You can connect further by joining the subgroups. In the lacrosse club, there are 3: defense, attack, and midfield. Or say you joined the book club; you could talk about books you've read. Kinda like lacrosse, book club also has subgroups: fiction and non-fiction. All in all, extracurricular activities will help you meet more people.\nStaying active physically and socially is good for your mental and physical health. When you talk to others, you improve your diplomacy skills, as well as your ability to hold a conversation. After all, who wants to be lonely for the rest of their life? Exercise, as I'm sure you know, does wonderful things to the body. Such as reducing fat, raising your cardiovascular endurance, and, in general, making you feel good. Have you ever gone for a, say, 1 or 2 mile walk and felt refreshed after? It feels nice doesn't it?

They have soccer practice Monday, basketball on Wednesday, lacrosse practice on Friday, and a basketball game, as well as a lacrosse game on Saturday. While that is a busy schedule, that person is forgetting about Tuesday and Thursday. What if they wanted if off? Well, think about it. Does it seem like these after-school things take up much time? Not at all! In fact, most of them only take up an hour of your day. This will also help you manage your time so you can do as much as possible within that small period. This skill will also come in handy when you are older.\nAfter-school activities are a great way to meet new people, help you get out more, and use your time to it's fullest potential.

        "Our beloved principal has decided that students attending this excellent school must be a member of a least one extracurricular activity, and I am in complete support of this idea. The benefits of this proposal are exquisite and will not only help students, but parents as well. Some students may think staying after school would be an annoyance, but there is something for everyone after the last bell. Whether students join a football team or a math club, many children will have a bright smiles on their faces when they're participating in an activity of their choice. All students should be required to participate in a minimum of one extracurricular activity because it will enhance the minds and muscles of students, teach students to be active citizens, and assist working parents.\nTo begin with, executing this decision will strengthen the minds of many students. Fun clubs like the Drama Club and Art Club promote out of the box thinking and creativity. A vast majority of students would benefit from these teachings because they work a part of a student's brain that isn't alwaysÂ challenged throughout the school day. Also, clubs are great way to introduce new career paths to children. For example, the Robotics Team introduces students to the growing world of STEM. Practicing STEM from a young age, especially in an after school club, is a spectacular way to increase the number of future engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, which would heavily benefit our technology advancing planet.\nIn addition to clubs, students would also have more opportunity to join sports teams. Some parents cannot afford to pay for a recreational or travel sports team, so this required extracurricular activity could help a number of less fortunate students participate in a sport of their choice. This requirement couldÂ also promote health benefits for students. With an extracurricular activity as requirement, some students who usually don't exercise may join a sports team, leading to an overall healthier school. Furthermore, with more students participating in school sports, there will most likely be more supporters at games. This could result in more school spirit and in total a more enthusiastic student body.\nAlso, requiring students to participate in after school activities could teach majority of our students to become good, active citizens. Good citizens participate in local government. This new requirement teaches students to participate in extracurricular activities, consequently many of them will form a positive habit of being active in their communities. Children form habits and learn many critical skills in their grade school years, so teaching them to start participating now could greatly impact the future of community activity. To elaborate, some students may join student council. Student council is superb preparation for future government jobs students might hold. Therefore, requiring students to become members of at least one extracurricular activity could lead to a better society with more active citizens.\nLastly, this decision could assist hard working parents. Most parents work 9:00am to 5:00pm, and if their children are at school for an additional hour for an extracurricular activity, they would have the luxury of being able to get all of their work done, and pick up their children from school on time. Mothers and fathers of many students work extremely hard to provide for their families. With an extra hour to spare on a day their children stay after school, parents could potentially have a more zen car ride, free from worry of being late to the car pick up line. As a result of having additional time to get to the school building, parents may drive slower. This could lead to safer roads with fewer accidents.\nTo conclude, the principal's decision to require students to participate in one extracurricular activity is beneficial to the student body and their parents. The decision helpful because it will introduce new ways of learning to many students, promote exercise and school spirit, teach students to participate in their communities, and help working mothers and fathers. This idea could also make the roads safer. As a student, member of many clubs, and a car rider, I believe this decision will make our school better for students, and make our school unique from others. Requiring students to participate in a minimum of one after school activity was a great decision made by our principal and should be supported by all of the amazing students that make out school special.",

        "Generic_Name\nGeneric_Name\nEnglish Honors 8\nMarch 11, 2020\nSchool PrincipalsÂ Should Not Require Extracurricular Activities\nTheir are many benefits to participating in after school activities, they can improve your knowledge on a variety of topics, introduce you to new experiences, provide a chance to strengthen your social skills, and most of all they can be enjoyable! They are not usually enjoyable however, when you have been forced into taking them, and especially not when everyone in your school has been forced to also. There are many reasons why students don't want to or even can't partake in these activities some of which being that it is a financial struggle for many families, it causes a stress for time, and can lead to disappointment.\nSome parents cannot afford to pay the fees required to enroll their children in extracurricular activities. Imposing a rule that these activities are mandatory would mean that they would have to spend the money that they need for other more important things in order to satisfy the principal's instructions. This would then deprive them of a comfortable home lifeÂ since they would be unable to purchase certain needs, and even farther from receivingÂ any desired luxuries. It may even endanger them because they are in an unsafe predicament that they can't afford to get out of.\nThe children's guardians might not have a flexible schedule that will allow them to take time to transport their child to and from their activities. Making them required would result in parents having to take time off of work or enlist others to either accomplish their home responsibilities or pick up their child from the school activity. The students would suffer from time deprivation as well. Time that the students should be spending on school work or family interaction would instead be put towards their activities. They would also not have any time to develop personal hobbies since they would be participating in arranged activities.\nBecause every student would be enrolling in school clubs at once there would be high competition and a large portion of the students would end up in activities that they don't want. This would leave them disappointedÂ about their assignment and disdainful of the principal's program. There is a possibility that it would even discourage them enough not to partake in similar activities in the future. Thus this requirement has more of a possibility of restricting the students strengths and cutting their future options further in life.\nThough there are some rewards that come with participating in extracurricular activities not everyone should have to. Each person has different factors to consider when choosing whether or not to join an after school club or sport. Furthermore, it should be up to the student and their family to decide if they can participate in these groups.",

Extracurricular activities are a great way to stand out to colleges. Many students shy away from participating in extracurricular activities because they aren't aware of the benefits. Requiring students to participate in them would eliminate future grievances.\nLeadership skills, passion, and being well-roundedÂ are all things colleges look for in students.\nColleges absolutely love having notable alumni; which is why, they look for pupils with many examples of leadership.\nSchools offer various opportunities to show off those skills.\nOne popular example is sports.\nWhat says leadership better than being team captain?\nSports are also a common way to receive scholarships.\nLast year, someone on the Riverside Baseball Team got into Princeton. It is very likely they got in because of their performance on the baseball team. He probably wouldn't have gotten into Princeton if he hadn't played baseball. The Riverside Baseball player is a key example of how extracurricular activitiesÂ are beneficial to students. If one isn't athletic, sports are not the only option.\nBeing the president, treasurer, or even secretary, of a club are wonderful positions to show leadership.\nMy older sister was the treasurer of Humanity First in her junior year and the president in her senior year; she was accepted into Duke.\nIt is highly likely that if she wasn't president, or treasurer, she wouldn't have been admitted. Leadership skills are vital for college acceptance, and requiring extracurricular activities would help students showcase them.\nPassionate people are sought out by colleges, and extracurricular activities are a great way to show passion. Passionate people are often very committed.\nColleges want active members of society in their schools, not people who sign up for activities to be able to say they were apart of them.\nColleges know when someone signs up for a club just because they think it'll look good for college. They want people to sign up for a club because they genuinelyÂ enjoy its purpose, and not because of what it'll look like on an application. Colleges want active club members; not club members who barely go to meetings. Participating in marching band for all four years shows commitment, passion, and loyalty. Colleges want those attributes, so they are assured their students won't leave them for another college, and if they decided their major, they will stick with it. Required extracurricular activities would help students find their passions, and they would no longer wander aimlessly in life. Extracurricular activities show colleges passion, and passion is rare among teenagers. Often, passionate people go on to do great things in the world, and colleges want to have notable alumni.\nContrary to popular belief, GPA and test scores aren't everything.\nSure, they are very helpful and important on transcripts, but there are other factors colleges look at as well.\nColleges like well-rounded people.\nThis could be linked to the fact that American colleges allow their students to change their majors. If a person is well-rounded, then it is more likely that if they change their major to something completely different, they will not fail.\nBeing an active member in extracurricular activities shows that the person is not just good at memorizing notes, but that they are also able to partake in deeper thinking. Colleges want people that can use all of their brain, and not just one side of it. If someone had a perfect SAT/ACT score, a 5.0 GPA, and no extracurricular activities, they would probably not be chosen over someone with an SAT score of 1539, a 4.35 GPA and multiple extracurricular activities.\nRequired extracurricular activities would stop the person with a perfect SAT/ACT score and a 5.0 GPA from losing their spot to someone academically inferior who had more extracurricular activities. In terms of roundness, colleges want circles, not triangles.\nRequired extracurricular activities would benefit everyone. Leadership skills, passion, and appearing well rounded would enhance anyone's chances of getting into college and receiving scholarships.\nScholarships mean spending less money on college, which helps those who are paying for college. In the end, the principle's decision to require extracurricular activity participation, was a good one.",

        "Imagine, if you will, a world full of students with smart minds and massive strength. It would be the start of something beautiful. I love this plan, the thought of having every kid doing either a sport or a club they like could really help them and the whole school a lot more than just the kids that do it now. I agree with the Principal because participating in extracurricular activities would help the students get to know their peers, it would give the school an extra source of income, and finally, make the students physically and mentally stronger.\nHaving kids do extracurricular activities would help them to get to know their peers. When kids do something with one another, they get the feeling of camaraderie and friendship that usually comes with being on any sort of team, It builds a tremendous amount of trust. Furthermore, when students come home, they might not have any way to reach their friends, the after-school activities would help them stay connected to their friends. Finally, when students do anything, and win, they are given a sense of accomplishment, a sense like they could do anything in the entire world.\nPutting all the kids into extracurricular activities would generate an alternative source of income for the School. We all know that our schools are sometimes overcrowded and underfunded if we helped out by just pitching in a small fee for every child to join an after-school team or club, it would help the school have some sort of spending money so that they could get new things. Just by giving the school that small fee, we could help the kids by creating new opportunities for them, like getting them free college tours, or giving them new laptops that would allow them to make researching easier to get into better schools. And lastly, those fees would help pay the teachers salary, they are overworked and underpaid enough as it is.\nGiving the students the opportunity to go into after-school activitiesÂ would make them stronger both physically and mentally. If students join a sports team like Football or Hockey, it would make them stronger because it builds muscle and gives them purpose. Furthermore, When you look into the science behind why after-school activities are so important you would see that they make kids do better in school and at home, their entire work ethic is changed for the better. When students are both physically and mentally fit, they no longer have that craving for freedom, because they have found it in their teams, they no longer make the terrible choices that lead to them doing drugs, alcohol, or breaking laws because their freedoms are there for them.\nWhen students are placed into extracurricularÂ activities, they have more trust in their peers, they generate a new source of income for the School, and it makes the students physically and mentally fit. when we give the next generation the tools of success, we are making the world better. The science cannot lie, when placed in these situations with their peers, they come out stronger together, like a family. So, the next time that a school has a mandatory extracurricular activity to graduate, do it. Give the kids the tools to express themselves and control their own destiny.Â",

        "Do you want more stress and pressure from your schoolwork and extracurricular activity? Do you want your time with your family and friends cut short? In today's world, students usually gets too much pressure from their extracurricular activities causing them to forget about their grades and schoolwork. Students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity in school because it adds more stress to their academic and social life and it cuts the time they can us to spend their time with their family and friends.\nIn addition to that, a reason why students shouldn't be pressured into doing an extracurricular activity is because it adds more stress into their academic and social life. For example, if a student joined a sport or a musical group, students that chose a sport would put their focus in practice since the championship games may be coming up. And students that chose a musical or art activity would also put their focus in their practice time to make sure to top first in their competitions. And all the students would put their focus into their practice time to hold up the school's pride. Meanwhile, their grades may be dropping because the students aren't focused on their grades since their extracurricular activity is keeping them focus on the game or competition. Making students' school work and extracurricular activity hard to balance.\nFurthermore, another reason why students' shouldn't have the need to take an extracurricular activity is because it could cut the time they spend with their family and friends short. For example, students that chose a musical or sport as an extracurricular activity would have to do practice after schoolÂ to focus on the game or competition, and sometimes practice can be held back late since the coaches orÂ teachers want to make sure that the students are focused to hold up the school's pride. And with that, the time the students spend with their friends and family would cut short because of the need to focus on his/her extracurricular activity.\nIn conclusion, making students do an extracurricular activity would add more stress and pressure on to the student making their schoolwork hard to balance, and it cuts time off the time they spend with their family and friends. Extracurricular activities can make students' schoolwork and social life hard to balance because of their focus not being on schoolwork or social life, but on his/her extracurricular activity. Do really want to have no choice but to join an extracurricular activity? And making students have no choice but to do an extracurricular activity can really impact their school life and social life.Â",

        "Imagine being in a club, the kids in it share the same interests as you. You feel at home in this club, and you can talk to your peers if you have any trouble. Making extracurricular activities, like clubs and sports, mandatory will give students opportunities to enjoy this feeling and much more. They will give kids new experiences, and help them with their social lives, I know that these are true because I joined a club once and experienced all of these things!\nWhen kids join activities, they gain new experiences that they had never had before. Firstly, they could discover hobbies, and find out that they really like something that they would have never thought to try before. There is a saying, \"\"You never know until you try\"\", and some kids need to hear this saying. They might never try to join a club unless it is mandatory, but when they do, they might find something that they really enjoy hiding in one of those activities. Also, if they already enjoy one an activity, as in sports, art, music, and others, then they can get more experience in that field. If a child really enjoys drawing, painting, and being creative, but they don't really seem to have time to practice that, they could join an art club and become better at what they enjoy. Additionally, making mandatory activities will get some kids to do something other than laze around at home. In my case, and many of my friends' as well, I have nothing to do outside of school and get bored really fast. Having a mandatory extracurricular activity will help me get outside the house and do more. For these reasons, students would get so many new, life changing experiences from mandatory extracurricular activities.\nStudents' social lives could change for the better because of this new rule. Children will make new friends during these activities. Joining clubs and teams will introduce kids to new peers, and they might even be potential friends. Moreover, making students join an activity will help them in the long run. A lot of clubs will require students to have good grades, volunteer, and more. This will be better for when children are applying for colleges and even jobs when they are older. Lastly, students will grow closer with their old friends. If students join clubs that their friends join, they can spend more time with them than they usually do. I only have half of a block with one of my closest friends, and none with the other. Joining a club together will give us much more time to talk and make awesome memories. In conclusion, making students join clubs and teams will improve their social lives.\nIn my old school, I joined the Lego club with my little sister, I didn't know many people and neither did she. My knowledge of Lego was also not very vast, but none of the other clubs had seemed appealing to me and I also owned some Lego bricksÂ at home. Prior to joining the club, my biggest, most impressive build was a multicolored box that somehow housed a small Lego girl. My sister was not anywhere as experienced than I was. In fact, she only joined because I had, and she wanted to do everything that her big sister did. The first thing we had to do in that club was to make a team and make a space themed build, and our sibling duo decided to partner up with another pair girls. We had 45 minutes, the leftover time would be for displaying the builds. When the time started, our little band of four barely talked, except for the occasional joke or two, but as time went on, we had started to open up more, and soon we couldn't build due to the amount of laughter coming out of our mouths. By the end, we had made an ugly, big, white box that a little, astronaut figurine had squished inside. A masterpiece. We couldn't even present our build due to the fits of giggles that had overcome us, but it was worth it, and my sister and I became good friends with the girls. As time went on, we got better and better at building, and I fostered a new hobby; building with Lego. As you can see, joining an extracurricular activity benefited both my sister and I, and making these activities mandatory will touch many more students.\nAlthough some students will complain against this new rule, extracurricular activities will benefit them in ways that they do not see. Their lives will be filled with interesting new memories as they get more comfortable in their club, or sport. Many more students will have a better social life, making new friends, gaining better chances at colleges and jobs, and improving their old relationships. My time at the Lego club proved these things to be true, and I believe that making mandatory extracurricular activities will help so many students. More schools should make activities mandatory, not just ours.",

        "Imagine having a long day of school, tests in all your classes, and feeling tired, then having to stay in school an extra couple hours because your school requires you to stay after school and participate in an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities are clubs and committees in school that you take part in before or after regular learning hours including sports clubs, yearbook committee, student council and more. They are great ways to keep students in touch with the school however, they should not be a requirement.Â I believe students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because students should be able to have a choice whether or not they want to come before or after school and students should not be required to stay in school longer than the required amount of hours.\nStudents should be able to have a choice if they want to participate in an extracurricular activity. If I am having a bad day or if I am tired from studying the night before I should be able to choose whether or not if I want to take part in an extracurricular that day. Furthermore, students should not be forced into having to participate in an extracurricularÂ even if they are feeling fine, they should not have to stay after school if they dont want to. An extracurricular is something that the student is interestedÂ and want to take because they want to not because the school is making them.\nStudents should not be required to stay in school longer than the required amount of hours that are set. Students already have to be in school six to seven hours a day, five days a week, there is no reason why a student should be required to stay in school longer than they already are. When the bell rings to be dismissed, I want to go home not stay in school for more time. If you want to take part in an after or before school activity that should be your own choice to come to school early or to stay after school.\nOverall, I think student should not be forced to take part in an extracurricular activity because student should be able to have a choice to take part in an extracurricular or not and students should not be required to stay in there school longer than they are required to. If a student wants to join an extracurricular activity they should but if a student does not want to the student should not have to. School days are long enough for a student especially when the student has tests they need to study for and projects that are almost due students should have to add more to his or her plate by coming before or after school if they do not want to. In the end, a student simply should not have to take part in an extracurricular activity if they do not want to.",

Same with every other sport, schools need to have extra activities or they will not be as good as ones that do. Students might want to switch schools if they don't have activities they enjoy, because other schools might have things they enjoy, like sports and clubs.\nIt will also make their school look better if all students are in a extracurricular activity. It could possibly expand the choices of what students might like too. There are plenty activities to choose from and students should have to at leastÂ choose one. Even if it's from cards to basketball it doesn't matter but schools should have students doing something. Schools should have a system to where you can make your own \"\"club\"\" or activity.

It is important for schools to have activities or else nobody would like the school.\nThis is why schools should have activities because they make schools look better.\nThey also help students get friends and, finally they help bring everybody closer together.

        "How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.\nThe first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there.\nAlso, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects.\nSecondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a painÂ to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for.\nFinally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.\nForcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.Â Â Â Â",

For example; A student who plays football outside of school can strengthen their physical and social health by playing with other team mates and working out at the same time, while maintaing new knowledge about the sport which would include new learning experiences too.\nParticipating in other activites outside of school can help a student figure out their true interests and help them discover carrers for the future. Making students try and learn something new can be beneficial if they are having trouble finding what peaks their interest. However, there may be some downfalls to this new idea. Extracirricular activites may sometimes not be so easy to manage. Especially with sports or activites for the school. Some activites can make students weeks feel stressful and overwhelming at times. Sometimes actvities can mess with the students outside life such as; traveling, family, religious purposes, etc.\nActivites that are easily able to maintain with the persons schedule and peaks the students interest should be acceptable to participate in. New opportunities could come up for the student reguarding to college or even future jobs. If a student decides to choose this activity in the future, companies would see that they have extra experience and might increase their chance of giving or accepting job offers to that particular student. If he/she works hard in school and maintains a healthy schedule that would not affect them severly, the student might get a scholarship from many different colleges and major in that specific category.\nHe/she might even make new friends in their new activity and might increase their chance of wanting to continue doing the program with them. Making new friends is also beneficial and could help increase the persons chance of wanting to continue participating in this new sport or activity.\nOverall, making students participate in extracirricular activites outside of school or for the school would be great to improve the students physical, social, and emotional health, help the sudent gain more knowledge about the acitvity, and decide future carrers and interests.",

Secondly, there is a vast number of students that dont participate in any activities at all. Doing sports and other activities could probably help some students a lot. You can hang out with friends while doing these activities which can make the activity more fun. Lastly, Everyone is always mostly on there phone so they dont do anything productive.\nMost of the time when kids get home they just lay around the rest of the day. Which is very boring, and not fun at all. Doing an extracurricular activity can stop you from being bored the rest of the day. When some students are bored they eat junk food, which is not healthy at all. Thats why some parents shouldn'tÂ let there child sit around all day. This happens very often where kids gain a lot of weight just from being bored. This can lead to a lot of health problems and i dont think anyone wants that for there kid. Nobody would want to see their kid really sick\nWhen doing these activities you can ask a friend to join you if they are not in any activities either. Asking a friend to join can probably make you enjoy the activity more. Maybe you might think the activity is boring and would be better enjoyed if a friend joined you so you can have someone to talk to. Having no oneÂ to talk to makes it boring and makes you want to quit. You can also meet new people and make new friends with the people that are also in these activities. So inviting a friend who isn't in any activities could probably help them too.\nEveryone is always on their phone and they really care about these activities. Sometimes students are more worried about playing a game on there phone or TVs when they get home. Thats these are even relevant for them. Additionally, They should talk about it more often in schools so the kids will see just staying home and doi9ng nothing isn't healthy and they at least should do sports or something productive. And being in front of a screen all day can damage your eyes. I don't blame them because being on your phone is basically like an addiction. Since there is so much to do on your phone instaed of actually going outside and doing things.\nIn conclusion, Being in a extracurricular activity could probably help improve your grades, your social skills, and your performance in school overall. It may even help improve some people grades, because a lot of people werent really focused on this type of stuff but joining an activity may help. It can help with boredom if students have nothing to do at home. It can also give them some fresh air if students are doing sports because they are technically cramped in a classroom and get stuck in busy hallways the whole day.

        "Shoot the ball! Quickly! Swish that was the sound of my team winning the playoffs. Our principal decided that every student should attend at least on extracurricular activity. His decision has impacted us in a positive way. It's safe to say that I agree with his decision. An extracurricular activity can improve one's life emotionally, and physically.\nOne gain in attending an extracurricular activity is that it can fix a persons body weight. For instance, being in a sports team or cheer leadingÂ requires a healthy diet and working out. If you don't complete these two tasks it could have you kicked from the team. This emphasizes the fact that an extracurricular activity such as sports can improve one's health. Who doesn't want to be healthy? Being in the basketball team overweight is a tough job. Especially when the students in the team must go to practice almost everyday. When they go to practice, they improve their skills in basketball and their stamina meaning they have to run a lot, it can be for any sport. Since the person is already doing their workout in practice, all they have to do outside is eat healthy. Now thats easy! Within months this person could have lose tons of weight and maybe even started to get abs. Sports, an extracurricular activity, has already knocked down the health factor in ones life.\nSocial life is another factor in which an extracurricular activity touches upon. It can help someone make new friends that take interest in the same things as themself. One can join the art or the yearbook editing club and meet people that enjoy drawing, and painting as much as them. That student could potentially have found a new friend that they can share their stories or ideas with. This shows that just one extracurricular activity could bring a student one step closer to their peers. This works the same with any sport as well. Sports also have the ability to make a student connect with others. Moreover, it can help a person communicate better with the friends they already have. If one is having difficulty coming up with ideas to talk about with their friends, they can join a club or do sports. This will give each of them something to talk and discuss about. They could talk about how practice was or what they drew in the art club today. These extracurricular activities provide some people with something to talk about with their friends.\nAn extracurricular activity can help with teamwork, being open to other people's ideas, and sharing a student's own ideas. It can improve the way students consider other ideas coming from different people. If a student decides to serve the student council they have to think about all the others that are also a part of their team. These students have to keep in mind that students around the school might give suggestions on what one should improve. This means that an activity such as, this one can improve the way a student might think about an idea a different student could have suggested. Since, these students are in the student council they have to find a way to come up with a decision that implements everyone's ideas. If a student is working on the yearbook they must find a way to add every person's art in it. Even if it means changing it up a little. Teamwork is a big part of joining an extracurricular activity. Though one may not like a person who is the same club, one still has to consider their thoughts as well. Furthermore, a student might not have the confidence to share their own ideas until they join a club or extra activity. When this person see's that people in the student council are being open about their ideas, he/she might start to share. Hiding ideas inside of one may not show their full potential. Extracurricular activities help get rid of that fear a students might have.\nExtracurricular activities can make one more confident in their own ability. It not only enhances a student's social skills but also creates a path to a better school life. I believe that the principal's decision wasÂ impactful because of all the benefits one can get. Teamwork, health, and social life are not the only enhancements that extracurricular activities provide a student and the whole school with. Lets go collect our trophy guys!!!",

        "Some peopleÂ may think that forcing kids into doing extra circulars, could help them in the future but what if these kids have other reasons that they cant participate in these actives? If my principal tried to force students into doing extra circulars, I would disagreeÂ because, there is a large amount of families who will not be able to pay, Students could already have other commitments out of school and making students participate could end up hurting their grades.\nFirst off, In most countries and the United States Poverty rates are very high, meaning more and more families could struggle to let alone put food on the table, then making their kids do a sport that could cost hundreds of dollars may not be possible for lots of families. Sports teams like basket ball or soccer, usually have away games. That could mean having to stay over night, which is also very expensive leaving the families already very pressed on money, to not be able to go or have to rely on other for somewhere to sleep and eat. Even if the Students of these families are thinking of doing the play or debate team, there is usually still some sort of fee to join, or get the shirts and go to events, still leaving families to not have the money needed to participate.\nAnother reason forcing students to do an school activity is what they are committed to out of school. Students may have to babysit there younger sibling after school, so making the student stay after school one to five times a week. Would force the family to find another way to get the younger sibling taken careÂ of. Sports out of school, most school dont have every sport a student wants to play, forcing the students to join somewhere else. these practices could take up most of their time, so making the students to another activity could end up leaving them no free time, or even having to quit their original sport.\nLastly, if the students actually want to do the sport or activity. There are usually tons of practices leading them to have not much free time in betweenÂ school and practice. If the student starts to slip on school work and not turn in missing assignments, their grades could and will drop very low. Some kids know how to balance out work and sports, but not all do, so forcing all kids to take away an large amount of time from where they do their homework, Could also end up hurting not just the kids but the schools grade average may go down to.\nIn conclusion, Forcing kids into doing an Extra circular activity, could end poorly due to, families not have the finances to pay, Students having other commitments out of school and the possibility of students grades being effected poorly by the amount of work need in sports and clubs. If my principle was making a rule forcing every student to participate in an extra circular activity, I would have to disagree with their choices and thoes are my reasons why.",

        "Did you know that the majority of students currently or have participated in extracurricular activities? This is because there are many different forms of extracurricular activities that suit every student's needs or wants. I believe that schools should require every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they, build friendshipsÂ outside of school, take the students' mind off the stresses of school and strengthen the body and mind.\nExtracurricular activities build close bonds outside of school in many ways. They require students to get to know each other better than if they met at school, such as if they have different classes or friend groups. They Strengthen bonds that have already been formed, like those between two students that share a class. They allow for in inclusion of every student who participates in these activities.\nExtracurricular activites are a very good way to relieve stress from school. Such as, if a student has had a bad day at school they can particiapate in their activity and release some of that stress. They also require students to think about things other than school. If a student is having issues with a certain subject in school, they can go to a team practice and stop thinking about that subject for a while. School based extracurricular activities also help form bonds between students and teachers, leading to a higher chance of a student asking for help in class.\nFinally, extracurricular activities also help stregthen the body and mind. Students may participate in a book club or the debate team which help build confidence and intelligence therefore increasing school capabilities. However, sports like football or basketball help build physical strength and endurance. Participating in multiple extracurricular activities such as football and the cybersecurity team would be a perfect combination for building strength and intelligence.\nThe requirement of extracurricular activities is a very beneficial thing interms of building friendships, relieving stress and building physical and mental strength. All of these together create a very good reason why the principle should require every student to participate in at least one or more extracurricular activites. Should this rule be set in place the school shoud expect to see a boost in moral, grades and physical capabilities.Â",

After a while of being in a extracurricular activity you get very stressed. Extracurricular activities are sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. The principal at Generic_School has decided that all students must participate in a activity, but not everyone agrees with his decision. I disagree that all students must participate in a extracurricular activity because not all students have the time to be in a extracurricular activity, and students have less time in their regular classes.\nTo being with, I disagree that all students must participate in a activity because not all students have the time to be in a activity. A extracurricular activity is useless for some of the students. According to teachers students get stress having to deal with an activity at school. Students worry about the activities and could get distracted. More projects or work having to deal with. Also most students are not very interested in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Students could also stress parents with projects and more work from the activities that they have to deal with. For example, my friend Generic_Name gets stressed with the work he already has in class and a extracurricular activity would not be very helpful for him.\nFurthermore, students would have less time in their regular helpful classes. Having less time in their regular classes makes teachers also stress. Teachers have less time in class to teach students what they need to learn. Students learn less and goof more around in the activities. The grades of students could decreaseÂ badly because they are not learning enough. Also not all students are caught up in class and they would have less time in class to finish their makeup work. For example, some students do not show up to school and they would not have much time to catch up with the work that other students have finished in class.\nAdditionally, I disagree that all students at Generric_School should be required to be in a extracurricular activity. Once my friend Generic_Name was in two extracurricular actives he was very stressed after only two weeks. He had so much work he owed and did not have enough time in class to catch up. So my friend Generic_Name decided to convince his principle to take the extracurricular activities away. The reason was becauseÂ the activities made students stress to much. I do not agree that all students must participate in a extracurricular activity because not all students have the time to deal with a extracurricular activity, and students have less time in their regular classes.",

I do not agree with the princapal's decision of making it mandatory for students to take an extracurricular activity because, students should have the decision of whetherÂ or not they want to take an extracurricular class or do another activity , doing an activity such as a sport requires the student to be good at the sport, and anti social students would not enjoy being pressured into doing an activity that requires communication skills.\nHaving the choice of doing an extracurricular activity should remain optional. Most students might enjoy not doing an extracurricular activity after school because they might have some other activity or hobby such as playing a video game, or cooking for their family. The students might even enjoy doing an activity out in nature such as fishing or hunting.\nMost of the extracurricular activities involve sports, and while some students are good at sports as Babe Ruth is good at baseball, some other students are not good at sports. The reason of why some students are not good at sports could be that they think they are not physically fit, they might not understand how the sport works, or the student simply does not enjoy having to move or run a lot. Above all else sports equipment might cost more money than most people are comfortable spending.\nSome students do not like socializing with other people, and most activities that schools offer require communication skills so that the group in the activity can make plans for whatever they will do. The students that do not like to socialize are often known as anti social kids. The anti social kids could feel pressured into having to do an activity that involves having to socialize with other people. Apart from that being pressure into doing something could cause have negative thoughts on the brain which could effect academic skills.\nIn conclusion it should not be mandatory for students to have to do an extracurricular activity because, students should be able to enjoy doing other activities outside of school, doing an activity such as a sport could require skill and before hand knowledge on sports, and most students that are anti social should not feel being pressured into having to do an activity which requires socialization.Â Â",

        "Dear, Principal\nMost people disagree with your decision to force all students to have an extracurricular activity for many but, fair reasons. The problems with forcing students to participate in aÂ extracurricularÂ activity are hard to miss. Most students are only able to work on homework for three hours. Students will feel exhaustedÂ ate school from the extra activities that happenÂ every week day. The students grades will plummet making the school look like a failure. This is why you must change your decision.\nFirst, many students struggle to get their work done in the provided time frame but since most of the extracurricular activities take place after school they won't be able to get their work done. When someone takes away time from the time period the students need they feel like they have to carry the weight of the world by themselves and then they break under the pressure. Some students have preplanned activities with their families who they now can't spend time with. The extra work puts too much pressure on the students. Without time students will ether stay up late or watch as their grades quickly decline.\nSecond, You will see students come in later and less awake because they are suffering from sleep deprivation. When people are tired they are most likely become unhappy and easily agitated. With bad attitudesÂ the school will have to give out more detentions then ever before.\nWith more students becoming exhausted students will not pay attention which could become a serious problem students could miss important announcements.\nThird, a problem caused by exhaustion can be bad grades. With worse grades summer school attendance will sky rocket making more people give up their summer. With worse grades more common students aren't the only ones suffering, teachers and principles could be under observation by the county or even be fired. With being kicked out of extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ no longer being a consequence of bad grades the number students going to the school could decrease. With parents wanting their kids to succeed in school the student population will shrink.\nWith out you changing your choiceÂ many problems will be caused for the school. First, without enough time students stay up late. Then, after staying up late they become exhausted. Finally, Without proper rest the grades will decline. So remember, only you can change what you choseÂ so please reconsider for the school and the students' sake.\nSincerely, Anyomous",

Our principle has decided that all students should participate in at leastÂ one after school activity. The reason why students should participate in an after school activity is sports, students council, and the yearbook.\nThe first reason why students should participate in an after is sports. Sports is a great way for the school to be recognized by colleges. Scouts from colleges will want to come to our games to draft kids into their college. Sports will also get the school trophies for students to brag about. Because of all of the trophies the other school sport teams will recognize the school as an actual challenge to go against.\nThe second reason why students should participate in an after school activity is the student council. The student council can encourage the school to do more fun activities for the students. The students council represents the students, so the students will be able to have a voice. ThereforeÂ the council will know what to focus on for the schools.\nThe final reason why students should participate in after school activities is the year book. Having students as photographer will mean they will take decent pictures. With a lotÂ of students in the yearbook club there will be many pictures to pick from. The yearbook club will make sure students will have memories of the school.\nThe reason why schools should participate in an after school activity is sports, student council, and yearbook.

        "\"\"My biggest in life is to help kids believe that they can be anything when they grow up.\"\"-Kobe Bryant. School is not only for learning but also for helping students practice valuable life skills. As most students think that school is just about learning, it is also teaching them important skills that they need to know later in life. Therefore, having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a good idea because it helps students work on important skills such as collaboration, creativity, and hard working.\nCollaboration I think is the most important skill to have to know on this list. Not only will you have toÂ know how to talk properly at work, you will also need to know how to talk properly anywhere you go. That is why the more you talk to people in a group the more you help your collaboration skills. Collaboration doesn't always have to be oral. It can be done when texting someone. Make sure you think before you speak also that is on where everyone has trouble on, even adults.\nCreativity can be good be bad. It can be good if your on a sports team and your need to make an exciting play. Creativity can also be found in artwork. Only the most beautiful artwork is fond from a creativeÂ artists. Now the reason creativity can be bad is if you take the lazy way out. By that I mean, say John's mom tells him to take out the trash but he don't feel like doing it, he then realizes that the trash can was left open. He decide to shoot the trash like it's a basketball in the trash. John then misses and he is left with a pile of trash to clean up. That is how creativity can be bad.\nA hard working person is a person who he/she puts effort into something to get it done. The more someone says they can't, the more they're telling their brain to just give up. But the more they tell themselves they can then they can do it. Just think of Jason Pierre Paul. He plays for the PhiladelphiaÂ Eagles. When he lost his arm as a young boy he though heÂ would never be able to play in the NFL with his brother. But he didn't quit and he showed the world how much effort he put into wanting to play in the NFL. He went on to win best defenses man of the year award. All because of his hard work.\nIn conclusion having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a great way to help students practice their collaboration skills, creativity skills, and hardworking skills. Every body needs to start learning these skills at a young age. So they can grow up to be a civilized human being. All we need is some modern civilized people. If we had them this world would be a better place to live in.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "You may think students should have to do an activity, but should they really be forced to? Students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity be fore, after, or during school. Being forced into something makes kids want to do it less, and doesn't give them the freedom and choice they deserve to have. Extracurricular activities take time and some students may be busy with things like homework or, at this age, working for a little bit of spending money. They also take away from time that could be spent with their families and unwinding after their school day has ended.\nFirstly, in middle school, kids are around the ages of 11-15, and they should be considered old enough to make their own decisions. Forcing somebody to do something is never considered a fun thing, or something you'd want yourself. This can lead to more misbehaving, and purposefully missing these activities. Giving the students the choice of doing an extracurricular activity would stop them from misbehaving or coming up with excuses to get out of something they may not want to do. And, let's face it, teenagers are at the stage where they would rather misbehave than listen to authorities, so it would be better to let them have their own choice in the matter.\nSecond, students may already be doing something after school everyday, meaning they don't have the time to do it in the afternoon. Some kids may have a lot of homework assigned to them by their teachers. Some students may already be doing a sport or activity after school that isn't for the school, maybe for the county or the town. Many students are given a lot of homework in middle school,or have plans after school. Which brings me to my next point.\nExtracurricular activities take precious time away from students. This time could be better spent making stronger bonds with their family members, or hanging out with brothers or sisters. While some people may not have siblings, this point still stands. A lot of kids' families are busy, and the one day they aren't they may have a sport or an after school group meeting. Some kids may have family visiting that they only get to see a few times a year, and it would be better for them to spend time with their loved ones instead of running around and kicking or throwing a ball or sitting and talking about school issues.\nIn conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities or sports after school without their consent. They miss time that could be spent with their families, or time that could be used on their in school work or spent on activities they may have that aren't from the school. They also should have the choice to do what they would like to, as they are in middle school and are not just little kids anymore. While you may think this was a good idea, the students and I disagree, and would like our choices back. It would be best for the school's reputation amongst parents and their kids and it would be best for the students themselves to not have to participare in an extracurricular activity.",

I believe that students should be able to choose whether or not do a after schoolÂ activity. Most of the time kids are exhausted from a long day of school, and want to rest once they get home ,they can't do that if they have an after school activity they have to go to. Often times people have to go home and take care of there younger sibling or other family obligations that are way more important then an after school activity. Some students already have mandatory sport practices and if they do have an after school activity right before it they are just going to waste their energy on that and will be tired for practice. Some work part time jobs after school to help support their family. There are so many more important obligations and they should notÂ have to stay after.\nExtracurricular activities are extra for a reason. Extraculicalar activities aren't part of the school day so we should not be forced to stay after. There are students that just dont like after schoolÂ activities. There is never going to be an activity available that interests everyone. When children's options are taken away such as having to stay for a extracurricular activity they like it less. They like having the option to stay after or to not stay after. Once it becomes mandatory and not a option to stay after it just feel like a chore that has to be done, but you dont want to do. Some students are simply not comfortable with after school activities because, they dread the thought of social interaction, and might be shy. They already have to deal with being scared of social interaction at school but then after school and it just makes them even more stressed and anxious. Kids like to take a break and have fun with their friends after schoolÂ and much rather do that.\nThe students will have less time to do their homework. When students stay after they have less time to do their homework or school projects. Students often stay up all night just to get there projects done or even study. School work is way more important than extracurricular activities. When a student has to do so many things at once they get very stressed and worn out. A kid might have to stay after then right after have practice for a sport then after have to work on a project till late. When students Sleep late they have even less energy at school the next day and often wont even be able to pay attention without falling asleep. If students have a test the next day they wont be awake enough to even remember the right answers.\nIn conclusion I do not agree\nI think that there is no reason for the principal to make everyone do an extracurricular activity extracucilar activities should be a choice. most have sports,jobs,family obligations,,just dont wanna go or have school work that needs to be done. After school being mandatory takes freedom away and as a child you already dont have much freedom so you should be able to choose whether or not you stay after. If a student likes after schoolÂ then they will stay after school ,but if a student doesnt stay after they obviously dont due to not wanting to or having obligations. Students are stressed enough with school work and projects to be having to do a after school activity. The students will not enjoy it if it is mandatory because children like having freedom. I disagree with the principals decision.",

Or, maybe, you just wanted to join ceramics or drama? Many of us, especially teens, worry about talking to new peers of ours. so we never try it. If we never attempt to go the extra mile to do something, we might miss out on the chance of meeting a life long confidant. After-school activities guide us into doing things out of our comfort zones to enjoy many unknown hobbies. These special groups provide such enjoyment and laughter to thousands of children. I agree with the decision that all students may participate in at least one extracurricular because it takes away unnecessary stress, gives new topics to learn about, and students can make new friends.\nFirst, learners should take at least one extracurricular because it removes unneeded stress. For example, it creates an enjoyable part of school at the end of the day. As every teacher knows, students don't favor school very much and adding an exciting aspect to it will let them relieve all that built up information about tests and homework. Also, this provides a way of releasing all stress by having a specific time that contributes to doing so. When kids don't go straight home and start their homework, they feel more at ease and relaxed about their schoolwork and don't feel pressured. Furthermore, clubs let young thinkers forget about the crazy nonsense that might've occurred at school that day. Maybe students got sent to the office and are worked up about that, this assists them by going somewhere where no one judges you and keeps you as calm as possible. Therefore, removing stress is a big factor on why learners should participate in an extracurricular.\nSecond, these activities give new topics to learn about. For instance, many young adults might be unsure about their interests, and they could make it clear for themselves. You might believe you hate art, but when you join the school club for it, it could be your dream profession to become an artist. Everyone will be able to discover their passions at their own pace. Additionally, if a person wants to be apart of a cultural learning group, it will grow their mind to understand different races and nationalities to compare to their own. While attempting to understand a unknown area, children enrich their knowledge of the world. Moreover, teens can have an opportunity to talk and address issues that are not taught in the classroom. They might touch on World War II in History, but if they want to go into it more in depth, World War II Club will provide them with that. In summary, extracurricular gives brand new items to go deeper into, which helps in the many ways listed above.\nLastly, people can make new friends. Many professors and parents believe that pushing our kids to meet new peers is wrong and shouldn't be accepted. They say that they should gradually build up the courage to speak up. But why not head startÂ them into the path of publicly speaking to people they don't know. Many children haven't been taught how to be confident, so I believe adding these activities will add that to the curriculum. When put in these groups, students are exposed to others with unique backgrounds. They all can share their own point of views to start up collaboration, which can lead to becoming best friends forever. Another point is the freedom of seeing people outside of your classes is added. When you have a pattern of saying hi to a variety of colleagues, you make more connections that could possibly last a lifetime. Introverts also have the chance of conversing very often. They are sometimes misunderstood and handing them a way of being understood might let them open up a bit. All in all, knowing new faces and personalities could create a way of adding friends.\nIn conclusion, I agree with the decision that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it removes stress, it promotes the making of new friends, and gives a variety of topics to learn about. Every teenager should go out and try something they haven't. They should understand that this new rule actually benefits them in ways that they never even noticed. You need to take risks to have new experiences in your life to look back on. \"\"New and \"\"different\"\" might be scary words to hear, but sometimes change and interaction is fascinating. Just take that leap of faith, and everything will work out in the end. When you join that ceramics club, all your fears of people and challenge will go away. Your mind will expand, and it could turn out to be your passion.",

        "Must all students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity? Some schools make their students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity whether the students want to or not, the students don't really have a say. I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity. The principle might just want to help the students so that they can get into a good college or just into a good school in general. There are many reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity. Some reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity is simply because they might not have time, their parents may not want them to, and they might just not be interested in extracurricular activities at the moment.\nHaving to take an extracurricular activity is a big responsibility in a way. Students might not have time because just like anybody else they also have a life outside of school and they have things that they need to do everyday. They might need to watch their siblings while their parents are at work, also they have homework for almost every class and apart from that they still have to do chores around the house. The students might really wantÂ to do a sport or join a club or maybe even do both but they might not be able to. The reason being is because they would then have to go after school so that they can go to practice for a sport or meet up with the other people from the club. There's a specific time you have to be there and if you can't make it you might get kicked out of the club or sport or any other extracurricular activities.\nNot having enough time might not be an issue but maybe their parents just dont want them to participate in anything. There are many reasons as to why this can happen, the student might get hurt really easily if its a sport or maybe even by doing simple everyday things, their parents might not be able to take them back to school when school is over because they might not have transportation, the parents could even possibly think that its dumb. There are many more reasons as to why their parents might just not want them to join a club or a sport or even just an after school class. The parents have their reasons because it's their child and they want to do what's best.\nLastly the student might just not want to do anything at the moment. They get a lot to do in school and they still get homework,Â then when they get home they might just want to relax. They might be thinking about doing sports or something else this upcoming year but just notÂ now. students get really stressed with all the work that they get that they might just notÂ want to add more stress by having one more thing to worry about. maybe they are military and they might have to moveÂ to a whole different place where they don'tÂ know anyone so they want to take a year off to get to know some people before they start joining anything.\nStudents shouldn't be made to take an extra curricular activity because they simply might not have time, their parents might just not want them to, or they might just not want to take any extracurricular activities at the moment. They should be able to have a choice of whether they want to take an extracurricular course or not. Students shouldn't have to do more than they have to if they really just don't want to orÂ if they can't. Students are trying their very best in school so they shouldn't be made to take an extracurricularÂ activity if they don't have to.",

        "I dont think that all kids have to participate in extracirricular activities because some families dont have enough money to pay the fees or pay for the equipment needed for that activity which isnt fair and most sports and activities do cost a lotÂ of money. And there probably is some activities that dont cost anything but what if you dont want to to that one what if you want to play baseball for the school team, but it cost one hundred and fifty dollars and your family cant afford or, say you can afford the sign up fee but how about the cleats,the glove,the bat,the bag,the jersey,the pants and the hat all that stuff adds up very quickly and thats a pretty popular and expensive sport.\nIt's also not fair to the kids who already play a sport or do something else outside of school and you dont have time to do both what are you going to do its pretty stressful just thinking about it and, your still are a student so say you have baseball practice then after baseball you have band practice but the next day you have a huge math test so what do you do school or practice? it can really affect your mental health dealing with all that stress and tension on what your going to do which could cause grades to drop off or, maybe your good at school and you play for a little league baseball team but now you have to do a extracirricular activity for school and your start to get more tired every day. Your performance at baseball drops and your grades drop because you dont have enough time to study and yeah, you could study after practice but by the time you get back it will be nine o'clock and you stay up and study so when you usually go to bed a nine thirty now your going to bed a eleven thirty and your tired the next day and you fall asleep and you get a zero in that class and you flunk the math test because your so tired. It's just not fair because you dont have all the time in the world.\nSometimes you have family issues where someone in your family is hurt or injured or in trouble and you have to be there for them every day but, you have a meeting on Monday so what do you do go care for your family member or even friend or do you to the meeting ? thats the question you have to ask yourself. Say your lost someone in your family but your mind isnt in the right spot and your just not in it that day but you have practice and it makes you more stressful because now you are going to have to pay attention on the next practice because you missed this one its very hard to decide and its not fair at all.\nIt's all so very stressful just thinking about it and stress can affect you in many bad ways such as attitude, effort, sleep, grades, performance just all around it can drag you down in a bad way thats why I disagree with the principals decision to make every student do at least one extracurricular activity.",

        "Extracurricular activities can be the thing that a student looks forward to doing that day, counting down the hours and minutes until school ends. They are a great place to interact with others and develop an interest or skill,Â where lasting friendships can be made outside of a student's normal social circles.Â The students have a greater control over how things are run, providing kids the chance to step into leadership roles. However, they are not for everyone. Students should not be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because the school could not cover the wide range of interests students have, would waste time that students need, and would ruin the experiences of other people participating in the activity.\nStudents have a wide variety of interests and hobbies, some that cannot be pursued through an elective or a school-sponsored extracurricular. The point of extracurricularÂ activities, after all, is to develop skills farther than what students learn in school. While some people with interests like football and journalism can join school-sponsored extracurricularÂ activities like the football team or the school newspaper, other students enjoy more niche or specific subjects. Incorporating these subjects into school extracurricularÂ clubs would be difficult due to high equipment costs, lack of space, lack of widespread interest, or several other reasons. For example, some students consider fencing to be their favorite activity. However, the equipment required to do fencing is expensive and prone to breaking. This may not be extremely hard for one person to afford, but starting a school fencing club would require the school to buy several sets. Furthermore, fencing also requires a 14 meter strip as well as extra room so other students will not get hit by any stray blades. The school's resources are limited, and could not sponsor an activity like this without the kind of support that only mainstream sports have. In the meantime, it is not fair to the students who fence to force them into another activity when they could be practicing fencing outside of school.\nExtracurricular activities take up time that would be better spent elsewhere. School already takes up a large chunk of the day, but by requiring students to do extracurricular activities, kids are forced to stay for one or two more hours doing activities that do not seem worth spending time on. If a student chooses to join an extracurricular because they wanted to and not because it was required, the activity wouldn't seem like a waste of time. For the other students, however, those few hours could be spent on homework, catching up on sleep, connecting with friends and family, or pursuing their interests outside of school. Many students are on sports travel teams, and they need the time to practice with their team. Some people take classes outside of school or just prefer to do activities they like at home. Although these students are not joining school clubs, they are still doing extracurricular activities and should be able to continue doing so without worrying about running out of time for homework or missing out on sleep.\nForcing people to participate in an extracurricular activity would ruin the experiences of other students. Making extracurricular activities a requirement would cause people to join clubs without genuine interest in the activity. These students will show less enthusiasm and put in less effort towards club activities and can drag things down for other students. They could be unwilling to do work or serve as a distraction to other students. There is a similar situation in elective courses, where some students only select a course because they believe it will be an easy class. Those students tend to participate less or be loud and off-topic. During group projects, they don't contribute as much. For many other students, it is frustrating to deal with these people, especially since there is no common interest in the activity they are doing.\nRequiring participation in extracurricular activities ultimately does more harm than good to students because it disregards that broad range of activities students enjoy and takes valuable time from students who should be free to choose how to spend it. It also detracts from the value of extracurricular activities- which are created by people cooperating and acting on a common interest -by adding people who don't enjoy the activity. Inspiring students to be curious and passionate should be the school's priority, but by requiring students to do an extracurricular club the schools are only boxing students into a mold that ignores the complexity and individuality of each person. Students are required to get an education that will help them survive as adults, but they should be able to decide which hobbies and skills they want to specialize in. In the end, the unique path they decide to carve out for themselves should be of their own making.",

        'Almost 50% of students in our school sign up for extracurricular activities. That is half of our school! But, there is another half to our school who do not participate in extracurricular activities. They all have their own reasons to not take part in these activities and should not be penalized for a reason which they might not be able to avoid. Therefore, I disagree with our principles decision to make it mandatory for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students need that extra time to dedicate it towards their family and other activities that they go to which they prefer over the ones in school, they might feel various negative effects due to these activities, and they also might dislike the options that they are provided with in school.\nStudents need this extra time to use it for their families and other recreational things they do after school.. They might have to hurry to their homes because they have to pick up their siblings. I know many who go home quickly without any hesitation because they have to pick up his or her young sister or brother who can\'t walk home from where his or her school bus stops by themselves. Many students live far away and do not get a school bus and could get tired after an after schoolÂ activity, making them unable to walk to their homes. Now, unless they can take the bus to near their homes or have a parent or guardian pick them up, this will be very problematic for them, especially for the people who decide to take part in a sports activity. People also sign up for other things that amuse them after school. For example, a student might have been part of a soccer team which they played for and trained with after school. This necessity of having to go to an after school activity becomes a huge roadblock if they want to really succeed as a soccer player or any sport in general. All in all, over usage of time by our school seems to be a big problem caused by these activities.\nSchools are funded based off of how their students perform and these after school activities play a role in grade drops. Learners are often stressed out in school already because heavy loads of homework or assignments in school and extracurricular activities will more likely stress them out furthermore. The likelihood of an after school activity which isn\'t fun and requires you to study in a boring way, is high. Our school even makes us do homework for 3/4 of Gaming club where we are supposed to be having fun and gaming with our friends. Which also leads me to the point that some activities are misleading. Students get upset when they realize that they signed up to do homework for almost the entire time in Gaming club. Once students get a firm grasp of the idea that the activities that they are doing are not serving their purpose, they will lose interest in those activities and maybe even school. Loss of interest in school is already caused by the core subjects. And placing down more things for students to learn makes them more viable to give up on school. Basically, schools would be seen as manipulating and stressing their students out to what they think ""benefits"" them.\nTeachers and the school, and of course mainly our principle, may think that putting down a rule to have to be ""using your time for learning and having fun"" makes us more productive. But in reality, it very much does not. The country with the best education system does not force work onto students by putting down homework on their backs. They instead, educate them in a fun and memorable way. Students will remember the time that they all hopped in a Minecraft server to learn math, and will most likely forget the time that they had to do five pages of math homework for two hours straight just to get a C on that homework. The manipulative part about these activities do not help the school in any way. Deceptive ways to get your students to work will backfire. So, schools should just approach this situation with more concern for the students.\nAll schools are not like this, so why should we be. Tricking our students to ""learn"", using up their time to force them to, once again, ""learn"" and stressing them our with these activities to make them ""learn"" should not be the way to go. School should invest more time listening to the voices of the students that they teach and adapt to modern times. Everything changes to fit the standards of modern society. Why should our school not do the same?',

        "How would you feel if your school district made you participate in an extracurricular activity? You may feel angry, or you may be exited. Some some students love being involved in fun activities like a sports team, or art club. Others have a good reason why they don't enjoy that experience. I believe that it's not fair to force students to participate in extracurricular activities because serious events at home may be taking up their time, they may have learning disabilities, and because it's another opportunity for bullying to occur.\nImagine that your mom is in the hospital, or your sister has anxiety and depression, and you want to spend time with them. Then your school district decides that everyone has to be involved in an after school program, and now you cant spend as much time with your loved one as a result of the time commitment. This is why I think it's important to let the students decide weather they want to do an extra activity or not. What if someone you where close with recently passed away, and you dont feel like doing extra activities? Than you wouldn't show up, and be marked absent. This is why I believe that we should not make students participate in after school activities.\nHave you ever had a to finish work from school at home? This is unfortunately common for students with learning disabilities. If students with who spent a lotÂ of time doing school work where involved with an after school activity, they may have no choice but to stay up late in the night doing homework. I myself have a mild learning disability, and its not uncommon for me to come home from school with unfinished school work that I have to finish by next class. It truly is unfair for the school district to force students to do extra activities which are supposed to be optional, and I hope they never do that in Fairfax County.\nAs many people know, bullying is a problem at many schools. Students hear the constant bickering, and teasing that often means that someone is getting bullied. This is another reason why I think that schools should not make their students participate in after school activities. Some students who get bullied at school laughÂ then so they don't appear a certain way to the people around them, when really they're holding back tears. After school is just another opportunity for a bully to strike, and a more welcoming opportunity at that. When you stay after school, their are less teachers and students around, making the bully more likely to act then. One day I hope that adults realize how difficult it can be to come to school and stay after to.\nI think that students should not be required to stay after school because of serious events at home are more important, some students have learning disabilities, and after school is just another opportunity for bullying to occur. I hope that next time you find yourself requiring someone to stay after school, remember to listen to and consider the person you're requirings concerns.Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Everyday you see kids participating in football, baseball, basketball, and other extracurricular activities, it is part of the balanced day for most kids. Extracurricular activities are important and enjoyed by most, but I believe children should not be forced to do activities like sports or clubs. Even though extracurricular activities are important they are hard for some to do. Many parents and kids nowadays don't have time for these activities with all the work and homework they have to do. Also some kids have disabilities or mental disabilities that cause problems when they are trying to do activities like football or yearbook club. In my opinion forcing extracurricular activities on kids is wrong because some parents and kids don't have time, and some kids with disabilities or mental disabilities might have trouble with rigorous activity.\nIn schools all across America kids have homework, it's unavoidable, children have to work hard no matter which school they go to. Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others. In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities. Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress. Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule. An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents. This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time.\nIn many American schools kids are burdened by a disability or mental disability. These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil. This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities. The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids. It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work. Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case. While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricularÂ activities because of their underlying issues.\nThis is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lotÂ of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities justÂ don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong. I can't believe the principal is even considering doing this, but what do you think? Should extracurricular activities be required?Â Â",

I think participating in an activity would be a good way to go out and meet new people. You can meet people who are very fun to hang out with. It would be a good way to open out and instead of staying home you can be at school doing after school activities.

This is a famillar feeling for students who take part in extracurricular activities. Whether its the newspaper club, robotics club, or the football team. These students get to feel a sense of acomplishment when he or she takes part in extracurricular activities. Therefore all students should be required to take part in an extracurricular activity. Joining these activities will help students make friends, explore future carrer options, and learn life lessons.\nStudents will be able to make new friends if they are required to take extracurricular activities. For example they will be able to find students with simillar hobbies as them. To add on students will learn communication skills which they can use to make firends. For instance if a student were to join soccer they would have to talk to eachother to know who to pass the ball to and when. Lastly they will meet more of their new peers who are also apart of the same club or sport who they might have not ever met before. In conclusion extracurricular activities help students make friends.\nExtracurriculars also help students explore future carrer options. First of all students can figure out what they are good at and explore future jobs that match those skills. For example if a student was in the yearbook club and he or she was really good at drawing they could look into future carrers as an artist or graphic designer. Also speakers come in every two months and speak about their jobs and how students could pursue their dream jobs. Furthermore students have a chance to get a scholarship to college for doing a sport. Then they could continue that sport in college. Also being good at a sport will make it easier for them to get into their dream college. Which is why extracurriculars help students explore future carrer choices.\nLastly by requiring students to take extracuriculars students learn important life lessons. For example student learn how to be good leaders. This is because in extracuriculars there is always a captain selected if you are selected as captain you learn how to be a good leader but, if u aren\'t selected as the leader you learn how to be a team player and how to follow a leader. To add on you learn how to balance your time. Therefore you must be able to keep up with all the stuff you have to do in your club and your school work at the same time. Lastly another life lesson you learn in clubs is how to communicate properley and respectfully with your fellow peers. These are a few of the may life lessons you learn while taking part in an extracurricular activity.\nAll students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurriculars encourage and help students make friend, explore future carrer options, and learn life lesseon. As a student body we must stress to all students how important it is to follow the principals wishes and, join extracurricular activities. Â Â Â',

        "Imagine being on a field and you just scored the winning goal while your school is chanting your name. Being involved in an extracurricular activity at your school can have so many benefits and even receiving little compliments that make your day can be a benefit. Students should participate in at least one extra curricular activity because they can show off their talents,have fun,and develop life skills.\nOne benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity is that students can get a chance to show off their talents such as in sports. A student could be insecure about other things going on in their life like family issues or friendship problems and they could have this one activity that can make them feel good and proud about themselves. Being proud of yourself is a very important aspect and everyone should have something they are proud about so they can show it. Another amazing part about showing off your talent is that it could influence others to try and find their hidden talent. You could change someone's life by influencing them and all they might have needed was somebody to reassure them to try. Lastly,it can make the people around you proud such as your family,friends,school and community. Knowing you made the people who love you proud is heartwarming and everyone should be able to experience that. Showing your talent is not the only benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity.\nAnother benefit you can get from joining an activity at school is you get to have fun such as working on the yearbook.

Another way activities can be fun is you are able to make new friends who have the same interests as you and enjoy certain things you enjoy as well. Making new friends can impact you in many ways such as impacting who you are. Lastly,having fun before you enter adulthood is very important since you might not be able to do all these activities when you grow up. Have all the fun you can as a kid before it all gets taken away from you. Having fun is one of the many benefits about joining an activity at your school.\nHowever, some people don't think students should join an extra curricular activity. Some people may think this because students already have to do so much at home and they are already so busy. This is wrong because students should be able to learn and have life skills for their future. Having time management is something every student should be able to do before entering adulthood and why not practice now? When we become adults we are going to have a lot of work on our hands and we aren't going to know how to manage all the work since we didn't have an previous experiences similar to this in school. Life skills are one of the most important skills there are.\nStudents should participate in at least one curricular activity. Learning something new about yourself,entertaining yourself,and learning skills for the future are all benefits of joining an activity at school. Go find you hidden talent and enjoy your childhood!

        "Don't you think students would be happier if they participated in a extracurricular activity? Playing a sport or serve on the student council or even working on the year book are some of the extracurricular activities a student can participate in. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would take students minds off of school work and its healthier for them.\nMy first reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it would take students minds off of school work. School can be very stressful and sometimes students just need to get away from all the test and homework. Participating in a extracurricular activity can help a student feel more relaxed and not worry about school that much. Students might even focus more in school and do better on there test.\nMy second reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it's healthy for students. Students won't be as moody or stressed out. Being stressed out might affect the student and they might feel overwhelmed and not want to try in school. By participating in a activity like a sport or other activities it can help students not feel so stressed out or overwhelmed.\nTo wrap it all up, students should participate in extracurricular activities because it can help them take there mind off school work and its healthy for them. School can be stressful and students might feel overwhelmed by it.\nThis is why I think students should participate in a extracurricular activity.",

        "There is an unfortunate lack of participation in extracurricular activities at our school. Moreover, the effects of vaping, gangs, depression, and procrastination have taken a toll on the student body. Seldom do I encounter a student who has not experienced some of the aforementioned issues. Therefore, I agree with this decision because extracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made, students to focus more on school, and prevent students from engaging in illegal activities.\nExtracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made. It is no secret that children are social creatures, and they require constant interaction with one another. If there were to be mandatory extracurricular activities, their need to interact will be fulfilled. Students engaged in an extracurricular activity will likely find more friends they can connect with, as another student taking part in the same activity may have similar interests as them. This will be different from a classroom environment, in which there may be students who do not share the same interests and thus unable to befriend each other. Without a doubt, extracurricular activities will be able to satisfy a child's need for social interaction and making friends.\nIn addition to helping students make friends, extracurricular activities can assist students with staying focused on school. These activities may provide ample opportunities for classmates to meet up and discuss homework. They also would encourage students to complete their homework once the activity is over. Extracurricular activities keep students in a productive environment, further their work ethic, dissuade them from returning home to do nothing but stare at their phones for hours at a time, and encourage them to finish homework. When a student eventually moves on to become an adult with a job and a family, they can use the experience they had gained while working with others in an extracurricular activity to help them become a functioning member of society. Certainly, extracurricular activities are instrumental in helping a student grow into an studious man or woman.\nExtracurricular activities prevent students from engaging in illegal activities. Gangs have made a resurgence in the school district lately, and students are partaking in crimes such as dealing drugs and vandalism. Furthermore, the teen vaping epidemic has severely impacted our school in particular. These illegal activities are fueled by depression, isolation, and bad grades. All of these issues can be rectified by implementing mandatory extracurricular activities. As mentioned above, extracurricular activities can provide students with ways to socialize and improve their academic situations. A troubled student may not be able to find time to meet with a gang or purchase a vaping device when they are involved in an extracurricular activity. Without any reason or time to break the law, order may be restored in the school and the consequences of gang violence and vaping may be avoided. Then, the troubled student can academically succeed and grow up to be a law abiding citizen.\nI support the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of their ability to form new friendships between students, make students focus more on academics, and eliminate the possibility of students consistently breaking the law. After this rule is implemented, the school, no doubt, will become a much friendlier and productive place for students.Â Â Â",

Kids should also have multipul choices to choose what they wanna do because here they only give them like three options that honestly is not far well thats my opinon other people might think other wise. I also agree because it will help kids get personal stuff outta there mind example parents fighting,getting bullied,over thinking,depression,there are many more examples these are just ones that came out of my mind because i wouldnt really think about stuff like this. Student council is actually really good i used to be in it but i got kicked out because my behavior and grades when i was in it i didnt put much effort like i didnt care about it but it was the only thing that had my grades good and now since im not in it i never have anything to do i wish i would have not behave the way i had so i would have not gotten kicked out but it is what it is. The principal actually is thinking because he does what new things for them in life so when they grow up they can say i did this i didnt do this and on the other hand if u dont do that you wont be able to even have fun you have to try new things in life because without trying you wont get anywhere in life. I also think they should have more options for the students to choose because not all students might like those options maybe they have other things in mind like gaming like you never know what they could be thinking you should let them speak out maybe they have even better ideas you never know because students have open minds some people dont know that. I just want you to let the students have a voice and not just the adults but its your school you do you boo.",

        'Have you ever wondered ""what if making students do at least one extracurricular could help them improve in school""? I know many people who have thought about that and truth be told, they are right. I agree with the principle that students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Doing this can help students do better in school, get better at playing any sports that they are interested in, and can help relive students who are stressed out from school or home.\ndo have a students who is struggling in school due to lack of knowledge and understatement? Staying after school for an educational extracurricular can and will help students do better in school. I have taken a language and struggled to understand and comprehend it, but at my school they provide us with after school clubs that are also extracurricular\'s. So one day I decided to stay after for a french extracurricular that I ended up really enjoying, so I started to go every day that it was offered, I started realized how much of an impact it made on my grade I went from having a C to an A. This is one of the many impacts an educational extracurricular activity can have of your students.\nHave you ever been really interested in a sport but not knowing how to play it?\nIf you think about it, Labron James was not always as amazing of a basketball player as he is now. The reason he is so good is because of how much time, effort and motivation he put into his practices. Staying after for a sport can put you on your path to being able to succeed to doing well at the sport. That is why it is so important to have after school sport extracurricular activities to help students who have a dream of playing the sport professionally accomplish it.\nStudents who feel more stressed out from school or home are less likely to do as well in school as others. Students who have parents who make them do homework as soon as they get home without a break feel more stressed, and probably wont put in as much effort as they would is they got a break. At my school they provide us with after school downtime clubs to help students relive their mind. It also helps students get the break that is needed form a hard working day at school, and students are more likely to have better grade outcomes.\nThis is why is it good for students to be required to do at least on extracurricular activity after school. They will help students do better in school, help students who are interested in playing any sports get better, and will help students who are stressed from school feel more relived. So next time you doubt what amazing powers of extracurricular activities remember how much of great of an effect it can have on students.Â Â Â',

I disagree with this, because I think students shouldn't be forced to participate in an extracurricular activities if they do not want too and some people's families may not even have enough money to pay for thing's they would need for the activities. I think if the principal did this then he would get complaints from the parents of the kids of them not getting the activity they wanted.\nOne reason I disagree is because, you shouldn't be forced to take anything you don't want to take.

        "Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity so they can make friends and do what the like without being forced. It also can help students get out of there shy zone and do something they like or enjoy, and just be themselves. I agree that all students should have to participate in at least one activity like the yearbook, helping teachers, and sports.\nOne activity they could do is help teachers with students. When a teacher is teaching and some students are having a hard time understanding the lesson they can help there class mates, since it's only one teacher and about twenty students. The teacher can't help everybody at one time so one student can be their little helper. So if one student understand the lesson then they can help the teacher with the other students. Also they can help grade papers with the teacher. So the students can get there paper back faster and see if they were successful or if they need more practice and studying time. So like if they got a 60% on there test then they know they can stay after school and get extra help so they can pass next time. One more thing is students are scared to ask questions because they think people will mess with them for getting help, so they just stay quiet and not get the help they need.\nAnother activity they could participate in is the yearbook club. The yearbook is like an important thing in school because it holds all the amazing memories that happen throughout the school year. What makes it fun is the students can go all around the school and take pictures. Also they can decorate the book and make is enjoyable for others. When students are participating in the yearbook it means they can make new friends and be be more active. If the students get caught in school taking pictures all the time, then ask them if they want to be apart of the yearbook club and they can take pictures all they want and not get in trouble. The yearbook club should be a place the students can be free, have fun, and not have to have a teacher yelling at them all the time for something small.\nOne final thing student's can participate in is sports. Some students love sports but scared to try out because they think their not good enough for the team, so they just sitÂ back and stay quiet or d nothing. If sports is something students' like to do then they should do it if it's basketball. football, soccer, or anything else then do it. Students have the right to do what they want without having to be asked or blackmailed. Like if a student is in GYM class and not doing anything then out of nowhere the coach says \"\"if you don't participate in the game then i'm calling your parents\"\". So let the students choose when they are going to join in a game. If some students want to play soccer but the others want to play basketball, then have one side of the court basketball and the other soccer. So they all can do what they like and have fun.\nI agree that student's should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as the yearbook club, helping the teacher, and sports. So the students can feel free at those times and have fun doing what makes them happy. Â Â Â",

        "The principal has stated that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity can be best defined as an activity that does not have to do with main school subjects, these can be sports, clubs, etc. Having an extracurricular activity can be very beneficial to students and teachers alike. People can join clubs, sports, or student committees which can help the school run smoothly and possibly even get it awards, if the teams do well. It can help the teachers refine the way they teach and help the students learn in an improved way. Finally, this can help the students in many ways, such as giving them more social skills, getting help in a subject they need help in, helping to find a new skill, or helping to nurse and grow a current skill.\nThe first way that having extracurricular activities is helpful and beneficial to students is the fact that these can help grow social skills. Many people in school don't really talk to others, they mainly stay either focused on their studies or on their personal problems, this leaves them open to bullying or, worse even mental health problems such as depression. This is because they feel that no one gets them and that they are all alone in school, being in a club, however, could let them talk to other people and spill their feelings about problems. Even if they feel that their problems are their own business, they could talk about things that they do in their free time, what games they play, hobbies, or views on certain subjects. Even if people don't have problems, they could be solely focused on learning and not talking to people, because they may feel that this is just a mere distraction from what is truly important. However, these people need to talk to people so that they don't develop depression or worse mental illnesses, which is where a club or social group could help.\nAnother way that this can be beneficial is in the field of academics. Many people in school are very talented, but they just don't understand a certain subject or problem, and teachers have many other students to worry about, so they may end up missing them. This could make the struggling student feel resentful, and start making them feel that the teacher doesn't care and that they should just give up, since there is no one to help, especially if their parents are too busy or if they don't seem to care. If they were to join a study club, things could change, someone else in the club could step up and help, better yet a teacher could help the student and they could help solve the problem and possibly even change the way they teach to help more students understand a particularly difficult topic. Going to this study club could also help people who are more focused on studies talk to other people or teach them, because it's said that you don't truly know something until you teach it, so this could be a learning experience for both sides.\nThe final way that this program can benefit the school would be it could let students find new athletic skills. More and more people now have started to just sit around and play video games or look at social media, this means that there is a higher risk of obesity in younger generations, it also means that they aren't getting enough sunlight to keep their bodies healthy. Despite many people thinking that saying this is just an excuse to get them outside, sunlight actually gives us the vitamin D we need to survive, so joining a sports team or even a hiking club can let people become more fit and healthy, and it could let them talk to people face to face, instead of over a chat, which will make them know that this is a real person, and someone their age who can be interested in the same things as them. For someone who wants to try out for something, but doesn't know if they have the skill, they could join a small club and practice for a sport to grow their skills. This could also let a person learn something new about themselves, such as finding a new ability that they didn't know they had, which could inspire self confidence in them. Along with that, this could lead to an influx of talented people which could help the sports teams out and potentially even lead them to championshipsÂ which would give the school large amounts of recognition.\nAs stated in the above three points, the principal's new plan is a very good idea that can be beneficial for all parties involved. Having at least one extracurricular activity lets students be fit and healthy, and it could also let themÂ socialize, build confidence, and work on schoolwork at the same time. Along with that, it could allow students who are already knowledgeable about something test how much they really understand it. This could also let teachers refine the ways they teach their subjects and also identity who might need more help than others which could let them do their job in a much better way. This project could help the school because if the students are getting higher scores and the teachers are doing a better job at teaching, then it could get the school more recognition. All of these would ultimately lead to a school that is vastly superior to others.",

        "Have you ever been forced to do something you might not always want to by a parent or a teacher, such as an after school activity? Many students are pressured to sign up for sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities by parents, friends, and teachers. This ensures that they are getting physical activity, time off electronics, and are spending time with their community. However, students should not be forced to participate in these extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ because of their homework and jobs, lack of time spent with their families and friends, and the money some families do not have to pay for these activities.\nStudents' lives are almost always busy, and many rarely have a chance to relax. First, they have to spend eight hours of their day in school, only to go home and do two hours of homework. After that homework, many students go work jobs to save for college or build a resume. Even after that job has ended, students go home and may have to help do chores around the house. Only after those fourteen hours of the day have flown by is the student allowed to finally get ready for bed, struggle to get their required eight hours of sleep, and wake up only to do it all again. With this crowded schedule, it would be near impossible to manage an after school activity that lasts about two hours on top of all that. Kids should be able to enjoy their childhood by hanging out with their friends and relaxing, not having to worry about how the yearbook is coming along, if the sports teams are doing well this season, and if the school has the budget for prom at the end of the year. Those are enrichment activities that people without as busy lives should be able to choose to partake in, not forced to.\nPeople hear a lot that they should strive to spend quality time with their friends and family, to ensure they don't become a little hermit that lives in a secluded world of their own. On top of the already insane schedule many students maintain, there's very little time left for spending time with friends and loved ones. Many students miss out on going to the mall on weekends with their friends, going out on dates with their significant other, and laughing at movies with their parents and siblings because they're busy working, applying to colleges, or doing homework that a teacher assigned to them over the weekend. Forcing them to participate in extracurricularÂ activities does not benefit the situation at all. On top of not being able to spend time with the people that mean most to them, they're being told to run laps at sports practices, waking up at dawn to get ready for the big game, taking pictures for the yearbook at events, or going to meetings with the other student government members to plan the school dance. This causes immense stress for students, and it also weakens the bonds and strains the relationships between students and their friends and family.\nIt's not exactly difficult to see the fact that many students' families struggle financially. Many times, the only time students ever get to eat is at school, and often don't have enough money for hygiene, clothes, or school supplies. If these students are forced to participate in these after school activities, they may not be able to afford it; if they can, it often becomes even more of a struggle for the family, as that money could have been spent on paying the bills or food, rather than it being spent on sports uniforms and gas for cars that need to be driven to and back from practices, meetings, and events. Sports tend to be very expensive, with registration fees, uniforms, proper equipment, gas to drive the students places, and snacks to provide after school, as many students need to eat during practices. ninety percent of Americans are already in some sort of debt, whether it's student loans, house mortgage, cars, or just bad spending. Adding the cost of sports or other after school activities will drown students and their families in bills that they may not be able to pay off.\nAlthough it is a good idea for students to participate in extracurricular activities, they should never be forced to because it impacts many students negatively because of their busy schedules, lack of time with their friends and loved ones, and because of the financial struggles many students' families face and may not be able to afford. Instead, students should be able to say whether they can and want to participate in these activities, or be able to not do extracurricular activitiesÂ and be able to relax and spend their leisure time however they please.",

        "Should students be required to attend extracurricular activities? Would this really help students and provide enjoyable experiences? While there are some good things that could come out of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities, there are some downsides as well. Personally, I disagree with the decision to require all students to participate in the activities because some students may not enjoy doing extracurricular activities, or simply might not have any time to attend them. Extracurricular activities do give some students the opportunity to expand their knowledge in certain areas, spend time with friends, and maybe help them find their passion in life, but other students may not be as positively impacted in the same way as others.\nSo, there are the students who don't enjoy participating in extracurricular activities. There are many students who don't prefer to do these activities because perhaps they are socially awkward and would rather avoid social interaction. Maybe there just isn't an activity that is available to them that is of interest. Another reason is that they might enjoy doing something else that doesn't qualify as an extracurricular activity. It isn't right that the principal is forcing students to do something they don't want to do. Students should be able to choose what they want to do and how to spend their time. Some may learn how to enjoy an activity after joining one they were unsure about, but others may end up not enjoying the experience at all, therefore, giving them something not to look forward to that was forced upon them with the intention of a positive impact.\nOther students may not like the decision that requires them to attend extracurricular activities, specifically activities held after school hours, because they already have plans, and being forced to attend activities would break in to their already-planned schedules. Scheduled plans such as family events; religious events; sporting events that don't directly involve the student; work hours for a job; or perhaps just time to finish schoolwork. All of these examples are things that students may not feel obligated to cancel, just so they can attend an activity that was forced upon them. There will obviously be some times when students are allowed to miss out on the extracurricular activities they are supposed to attend, but why give students a sense of worry about not being able to go to an event that they might feel very obligated to attend?\nOnce again, I disagree with the decision to force students for participate in extra curricular activities because some may not enjoy doing them, and others may not have time to attend them. The fact is, is that the principal should not be forcing students to attend extracurricular activities. The principal should be giving every student the opportunity to find one and attend one if they wish to, but never have it be mandatory that they do. Many students do enjoy attending extracurricular activities, but it is important to consider the few who don't when making a decision like this.Â",

        "Generic_Name enjoyed going to school so he could socialize with friends and learn about new things. That all changed when his principle decided to make every student required to participate in one or more extracurricular activity. This greatly angered Generic_Name and his parents; many other students felt the same way as he did. None of the activities listed spiked an interest in Generic_Name, but he was forced to participate in one. All the activities took a considerable chunk of time from him which resulted him losing time with his family and friends. Generic_Name thought to himself, \"\"Why do I have to do these extremely boring and useless activities?\"\" Over the course of several weeks, these activities continued and his stress level skyrocketed; his grades started to plummet due to all his stress and he also lost some friends due to his increased irritation due to the activities. He felt like these extracurricular activities have ruined his life. Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because they may not have interest in any of the activities, they may not have the time to participate in any actives and, students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need.\nOne of the more important reasons why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because that they may not be interested in any of the activities. When students are forced to do something they don't enjoy, it makes them frustrated and not willing to work. If students and not interested in an activity, why force them to it as it will interfere with the students that are genuinely interested in the activity? A supporter of required extracurricularÂ activities would say that it allows students to try new things that they may enjoy. However, this is just not the case for most students because students can determine what an activity would be like with the given information. Most people would not want to do something they don't enjoy, so why make the students do it?\nA contributing factor to why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because that students may not have the time to participate in any activities. As more and more students do activities not related to the school, they would not be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Students may also not have time due to them being with family and friends and students should have to be away from family and friends if they don't want to. A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that students would manage their time wisely. That is false due to the fact that students may not be able to change to time for their other activities and they might only to be able to see their family and friends at certain times. If students don't have the time for extracurricular activities, they shouldn't have to participate in them.\nThe most important reason why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need. As students already spend up to seven hours a day in school, they shouldn't have to spend anymore time than they want. What students want to do after school should be up to them, not the school. Forcing students to do something unneededÂ that takes up their precious time is just wrong; Student's time should not be stolen like this. A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that forcing students to participate in these activities would be beneficial them. This is not the case because students would not get a benefit from being forced, it would be the opposite. Students shouldn't be forced to do something, they should have the option to do something, but not be forced.\nThough extracurricular activities may be beneficial to some, it is not for all students. Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because they may not have interest in any of the activities, they may not have the time to participate in any actives and, students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need. If students were forced to do extracurricular activities, it would be problematic for the students and the school. Students should be able to decide how they want to spend their youth, not the school. If you could change any of my reasons, what would you change?",

        "Do you believe in being active or socializing. Many people dont like to do extracurricular activities. I agree that all students have to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because the students can make new friends or have the opportunity to get in shape.\nOne of the reasons you have to do an extracurricular activity is you can make friends. For example, you can talk to other students while you help make the yearbook or play in teams in a sport. My Cousin used to be super shy, but when he played in extracurricular activities he made plenty of friends.\nAnother reason to do an extracurricular activity is that you can get in shape. For example, if your extracurricular activity is sports you can work out your muscles. My sister used to hate her body, until she chose track as an extracurricular activity and started to losing weight.\nMany people love to play sports or help make yearbooks. Extracurricular activities are very helpful. I agree that students should do at least one extracurricular activity because the students can get in shape or can make friends.",

        "Research has shown that exercising does help you live longer. However what if you were forced to do a sport or something after school that is not a sport? Me personally I disagree, but I am going to talk about my opinions on why right now.\nPeople shouldn't have to do anything after schoolÂ if they don't want to. Staying after school is a opportunity to have fun and see some of your friends. Therefore if it was forced it would defiantly not be as much fun because you wouldn't want to do it. Nobody should be forced to do something if they don't want to.\nThere are other things people want or have to do sometimes instead of staying after school everyday. It would take away some of the fun. For instance what if someone wants to go out of town but they can't because they have to stay after school. Additionally people have other things to do outside of school, things like ballet, basketball for someplace else, maybe any sport, etc.. If they did then they would be burned out like a fire in the rain.\nHaving homework and having to stay after everyday would be terrible. With having to stay after school also comes homework. We at least have one thing to do everyday, sometimes more. With that being said some after schoolÂ activities last 2:30-4:00 or 2:30-6:30. Homework usually takes 20 minutes tops depending on what it is, but when you have 2 or 3 things to do you can't go to bed until late. Also studying can be hard with an after schoolÂ activity because that really takes a long time. Additionally, you still have to shower and do things to prepare for the next day which makes you go to bed even later when you have to wake up at 5:30-6:30AM. Only that is whole different subject for a while different time.\nStaying after school is fun but if you were forced it would change everything. People stay after because they want to, not because they are forced too. It would defiantly not be fair if people were forced too. That is my opinion on this question.",

        'Starting at a young age and throughout their life, every child and person wants to be great at something. If you look at the people who are truly great at what they do, they all started their passion at a young age. Many sports players, politicians, and people in all fields are a great example of this. Quite frankly, extracurricularÂ activities are a great way to spur interest within students in their youth. For this reason, I believe that the principal made the right decision about making students do at least one extracurricular activity. Beside for getting students to develop an interest and passion for something at a young age, extracirrular activities also help people become more confident in their abilities. Additionally, with all of these options, there has to be at least one activity for each student to have an interest in.\nAs I stated earlier, extracurricular activities are a great way to get students to find a new interest. For all you know, the student may really like the activity and pursue it as a profession. Without being required to do the activity, the student may not have even discovered their interest in whatever the activity is. Requiring students to do extracurricular is a great way to open new door and possibilities for the student. There are many different activities the student can take, so at least one has to be appealing. By finding out what they have an interest in, and starting at a young age, the student will have plenty of time to develop the skills need at get really good at something. It is important to be unique in at least one thing, because it helps identify who you are as a person. Even if the student does not ""fall in love"" with their activity, it still could not hurt to try something new.\nStaying on the topic of learning something new, extracirrular activities are a great way to get students out of their comfort zone and to build up self-confidence. If the school did not require the student to take an extracurricular activity, chances are that the student would not have tried out something new. By making students try something new or continue something that they are already good at, it is making them better at whatever they are doing. This boosts their confidence level, and makes them want to try even more new things. Additionally, many of these clubs and activities include working with other people and students. This means that these clubs help students with their communication, organization, and teamwork skills. Personally, I am on my school\'s debate team, and I enjoy not only having fun and tournaments, but also working with my friends that are also on the team. Even though I do not really plan on becoming a lawyer or politician, I still feel as if being on the team has made me a more confident and clear speaker. Helping develop important life skills is once again another benefit of making requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity.\nWhether it is a sport, club, or leadership position, there is always something for each and every student. Based on the field that the person wants to go in, they can do an activity that is related to that field. For example, if the person wanted to be a politician, they could do something relating to the student council. Out of the many choices for extracurricular activities, at least one has to fit each student. Even if the student is not sure what they want to be, there are also plenty of options such as sports that are plenty of fun!\nAlthough some people may say that it is not right to force somebody into doing an activity, or say that there are better things the person can do with that time, the whole purpose of requiring students to do after schoolÂ activities is so they can get better. Not only do extracurricularÂ actitivites help give students important life skills, but they also give students a chance to gain an interest and passion in an activity. If anything, it just giving the students another opportunity to try out something new. It is almost guaranteed that every student will find something that they can manage, so there is no downsides of requiring students to do extracurricularÂ activities.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it is best for people start something at a young age, and requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a great way to do that.Â',

Whether it be a group project or the school play; it's all a group effort. Everyone having at least one extracurricular activity gives us students the chance to develop their skills and talents, it'll give us experience for our future work place, and give us a chance to make ever lasting friendships bettering the group efforts.\nWorking on an extracurricular activity can help us learn talents and while developing older skills. Some students may learn important social skills and, other can develop those skills. Many students have hidden talents yet, might not ever be able to use it if they're just doing standard desk work. I hope with this new rule we can all express ourselves while learning from valuable experience.\nIn recent years, studies have shown that 66% of students who joined a club or have done an extracurricular have a higher chance of getting into colleges or getting a job. A lot of people can benefit from extra work experiences. Jobs and colleges are looking for talented individuals who know how to work. I think that is reason enough to start this program.\nThese activities give students who only want to socialize with people like them a place to meet others. Students with similar interests working together can be a force of good. When you get to learn and work beside those who you are comfortable with you'll do and feel much better. With everyone working together and no one is excluded everyone gets to help out and be apart of the group.\nGiving student a place where they can learn and develop talents and skills while also giving them work experience and, helping the meet new people is definitely a good idea. A school where students are able to express themselves in their own creative groups. That will not only give us great memories but, will also help us as adults.

        'Imagine a school where no student feels left out and everyone has a group of friends where they belong. The students are genuinely happy to be in school, are generally in a good mood, and are also doing well academically. This would be the result of all students participating in an extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity is any activity that someone does outside of school, like sports, working on the yearbook committee, or serving on the student council. Our principal should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will encourage students to make friends and develop new skills.\nRequiring students to participate in extracurricular activities gives them the opportunity to make new friends.Â Anyone who has been a part of a team or club knows that when someone is a part of a group, they form friendships that can last. Additionally, students who were always too afraid to be themselves at school would have a second chance at doing so by buiding confidence.Â Having friends is important because friends can make a person happier overall and give them a sense of belonging. Making friends outside of school will also earn them more friends in school. Soon, the empty nearby seats at the lunch table will be occupied with people that a student met at one of their extracurricular activities.Â Some people may not be very social at school, but participating in an activity outside of school will give them the chance to speak up and form strong friendships.\nWhether a student is interested in doing sports, cooking, or participating in an academic competition for their extracurricular activity, they will develop several important skills along the way.Â The most obvious skill they will develop: being able to do that particular activity. However, students will also develop leadership skills, collaboration skills, and many other skills that can be applied to tasks and activities that they will do in the future. For example, one extracurricular activity that I participate in is dance. Dance has taught me how to work well in a team because I have to work with the other girls in my group to create unified movements. Dance has also taught me leadership skills and teaching skills because I often teach dance classes for the students at a lower level. I have the responsibility of deciding what they need to accomplish that day, and then executing it. Like dance, extracurricular activities can teach students important skills, that will benefit them in school and in the future.\nIn the end, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will only benefit them by giving them the opportunity to make new friends and develop important skills.Â If someone is marked as the ""shy kid"" at school and doesn\'t have friends, participating in an extracurricular activity will build their confidence to speak up and make friends. Extracurricular activities can also teach students important life lessons and give them skills that will improve their work and relations in school and in the future.Â All in all, requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a decision that at first glance seems terrible because it takes away the students\' freedom, but in reality, it will have many positive effects on their lives.',

        "Do you think that every student should have to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity? Well, in my opinion I don't think that students should have to be forced into that. Doing that could cause a lot of stress on many of people.Â That being said, the parents of those students would then have to worry extra about any activity their children is participating in. Now, think about all the trouble the kids that are disrespectful would cause. That would mean more trouble-making kids to deal with all the time. I disagree with this decision because not all students have the extra time, permission from their parents, or they might even abuse this privilege.\nFirst off, have you ever thought about how much spare time another person has on a day-to-day basis? Many students have a set routine that gives them a plan of what they do everyday. Whether or not that includes chores, time with their family, or even a job that gets them some money. Putting that responsibility on the kids and parents will cause a lot of chaos. This would mean working parents struggling to find a ride for their kid, or even the kids who might already struggle with time management with the stuff they have to do everyday.\nNow think back, has anybody, even your parents, ever told you no, that you can't do something?\nAll children face this answer everyday; It may be about going to their friends house, or asking to stay home from school. Just imagine a pair of very busy parents, or even a single parent, having their kid ask if they can participate in a extracurricular activity. Their first thought could be, \"\"This is going to affect my work schedule and I can't loose anymore money.\"\" If they get told no by their parents, while this rule is enforced, it may cause them to get in trouble by their principle or teacher.\nLastly, have you ever hosted or attendedÂ an event thatÂ a lot of people showed up at? If so, you know there are some people who don't care about anyone else and will cause trouble wherever they go and whenever they want. If that were to happen at a school, and the children who see it go home and tell their parents, the school would get a lot of complaints. After a certain amount of complaints the school would start to be questioned by higher authorities and they may even be looked down upon. Some students will get that type of opportunity and abuse it. They will cause as much mischief and chaos as they can. They may cause fights, be disrespectful to their mentor, or even damage school property.\nIf you haven't already realized how this decision could affect a school, then hopefully you understand it now. There may be a handful of students that care about participating in school activities or sports. But not every student is that way. Making all the students at a school participate in a extracurricular activity could cause a lot of problems, with the students or parents. This decision would be a big problem because some students may not have the time, they may cause a lot of trouble and are disrespectful, or they may have parents who are too busy for any extra activities.Â",

        "Have you ever participated in an extracurricular activity before?\nWho or what made you participate or join that extracurricular activity and benefit from it? Many schools convince or make students participate in extracurricular activities such as sports, working on the year book,or serving on the student council to make them active in order to prevent them from being idle apart from school basedÂ activities. I agree that our principle should make us participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents.\nThe first reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it keeps us fit and healthy. For instance,take a sport such as basketball. Most basketball players are fit and healthy because basketball serves as a physical activity which makes them be in a very good shape for any situation. Playing basketball can also make people healthy by burning fat from their bodies and preventing their blood vessels from being clogged. Being fit and healthy means a lot to the school ,and that is why the principle should make us participate in extracurricular activities\nThe second reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it can improve our brain function. Apart from school activities, students can also acquire more knowledge to improve their brain function by participating in extracurricular activities. I once read an article on a website named \"\"Gale.\"\" It stated that scientists have proven that students that have participated extracurricular activities in schools have improved brain function and has made them more attentive, more quite and more discipline ,but I didn't believe that until my friend from another school,which has extracurricular activities,told me he joined the student's council. At first, I told him it wasn't going to do him any but in a few weeks, I noticed changes about my friend. He had become much more brilliant and more knowledgeable. He told me it was because he joined the students council and it improved the ability of his brain to think and to act some ways. So improved brain functions of students is one thing we would benefit from if our school was introduced to extracurricular activities.\nThe final reason\nI agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is thatÂ it can help students find their unknown talents. An example I would like to share is that my elder sister was in high school ,and she participated in the extracurricular activities. At first, she didn't want to participate in it ,but my mom edged her to do it becauseÂ she saw her juggling her ball ,and my mom saw that she was very good at soccer. She could have made her join a youth team for soccer ,but she didn't have enough money. When my sister joined, she didn't perform well at all ,but when the coach motivated her, she showed her through colors. She led the school's women soccer team to win the district finals and the state finals. People always asked her where she had acquired these skills for soccer ,but she had only one answer,\"\" I didn't discover my talent until I joined my school's extracurricular activity.\"\" She is now a big superstar play in Europe for a club named Arsenal. So many talents can be revealed if the principle could make everyone participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\nIn conclusion, I agree that the principle should make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents although one might disagree with my decision.",

There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other prioritiesÂ whether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.\nThere is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they dont have enough time already and if forced to join a club that only meets once a week for an hour that just cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sports that are very time consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time consuming part of every child'sÂ life is family, spending time with grand parents or even just having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.\nA huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.\nTo close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club dont want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it just makes everything worse. Also there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.\nKids shouldnt be required to be in an extra curricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many different things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.",

        "Some people agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities instead of letting the students stay home and do what they want to. This is wrong and cause many problems. I disagree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments.\nThe first point is that students may not have time for these activities. For instance, students could be participating in other events that are not provided by the school. If students tried to participate in both activities, one could get in the way of another and cause issues. Students may also miss the activities because they are spending time with their families. If they were forced to go to these activities, they could loose the time they would be spending with their family by participating in the activities. Another problem that could occur is the parents not having the time to take their children their activities. This could be cause by work or any other event that the parents must attend.\nThe next point is that students may not be interested in the activities that their school provides. This could be because the school may not have many activities. If the school does not have many activities, some students will be left out and forced to choose one that they do not want to participate in. Another reason could be that the school does not have the money for specific activities. For example, a student may want to participate in wrestling, but the school cannot provide the needed gear and mats. This would mean that the student cannot participate in an activity that they would like to participate in.\nThe final point is that students may not be able to complete assignments. If a student has a very important test that they must take, they have to study for it. If the student cannot study for tests, they may get a poor grade. Students may also have projects or homework that must be completed. If they do not complete these things, the student's grade could fall and they would have to work harder to raise it. If they still did not have the time to work extra because of the required activity, they could suffer from an even poorer grade.\nIn conclusion, students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments. If students are required to participate in these activities, many problems could arise. Â",

After all, extracurricular activities are a great way to make new friends, learning new things, and give you an opportunity to help the school out.\nThe first reason that mandatory extracurricularÂ activities are beneficial, is you can make lots of new friends.

So get out of the house and make some new friends by joining an extracurricular club!\nThe second reason that they are beneficial, is think about all the new things you can learn, by joining extracurricular activities you learn new things through social interactions, or improve on pre-existing skills. Either way you learn tons of new things in these clubs. Also these clubs already exist, so why not join them? By not joining you are wasting the opportunity to learn and more importantly have some fun!\nFinally, one day you can put some of these clubs on your resume. It might sound crazy but it's true. If you are trying to get a job relating to coding, and you took the coding club as a kid, you can slap that on to your resume! That could be the difference between you getting the job and another person getting a job. You never know! My dad told me that he still remember some of the things he learned in a coding club and still applies that knowledge today. These clubs are free knowledge so take advantage!\nIn conclusion having mandatory extracurricular activities is beneficial because it gives you many social opportunities, you can learn many new and exciting things from these extracurricular activities, and these extracurricular activities can be used throughout life. If you school does not make this mandatory, you should join a club anyways. But choose wisely!",

Doing these activities can be great exercise mentally and physically, be an awesome learning experience and help with future life skills.\nPrograms like sports or academic clubs can be great way to exercise. Sports are a great way to build muscle and exercise physically, while academic clubs are also great exercise, but for your brain and building problem-solving skills. Going to these extracurriculars are the perfect thing for your brain to do that doesn't involve a cellphone. Sports and other activities are a very productive thing to do for your brain but are also fun to do. Another thing extracurriculars can do is relieve stress in a good way. Running around or doing something you love can relieve stress from school and other things that happen in life.\nDoing an extra activity can be a great learning experience teenagers.

Participating in these activities can also be an easy way to find a new hobby that you love doing. Being in a program like yearbook or helping with special education classes can be a way for you to volunteer your time to someone who needs it.

        'Isolation. Nothing to do. That\'s what most kids do when they get home. Play video games or sit on their phones for hours. That\'s why schools should have students participate in one extracurricular activity. This could help make students happier and healthier, improve social skills, and give opportunities to explore their interest.\nOne reason schools should have students participate in one activity is because it makes students healthier and happier. Studies from John Hopkins university stated that ""9 out of 10 kids are happier when they participate in activities."" Which means more students are in a better mood because they\'re moving around and getting exercise. Getting kids to go outside can improve their mood swings. Not only does it help with mood swings, it also helps with depression. Healthier and happier students tend to be more happier in general\nAnother reason kids should have extracurricular activities is because it improves social skills. Professor Jimmy Facs, from University of New York, says, ""kids who get involved in out of school activities, have better social skills than kids that do not participate in anything. Also, getting involved in out of school activitiesÂ help kids with anxiety."" Facs basically is saying that out of school activities helps kids get out of their comfort zone. Pre-teens who have anxiety could feel more safe around the people at their school. Kids that participate in extracurricular activities could also meet new friends that they\'ve never talked to or even see before. Meeting new people could form a better community at this school.\nAnother important reason is that extracurricular activities could open up new opportunities or interest for students. A survey from students at Generic_School shows that 3 out of 4 students find a new hobby or interest that they enjoy. This means that kids could try something they\'ve never tried before. Finding more interests for students could help them open up their choices of what they want to become when they grow up. This could also help students find people who have the same interest.\nSome parents and students complain that they won\'t have time for homework. In an article produced by the Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City says, ""kids that participate in multiple sports still come home to homework. This could make the student stress and have a mental breakdown."" The Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City is stating that kids mental health is bad because they have multiple activities going on. Although some students say they get stressed from more extracurricular activities, most kids already participate in one. In an article by Generic_Name, she states, ""5 out students 6 say they already participate in sports. A student from Generic_School, Generic_Name, even says, \'I play 4 sports and I have never been stressed. Playing 4 sports actually makes me feel less stressed.\'"" Generic_Name is saying that most kids play sports to relax them. Relaxation makes students feel more focused in school. Putting all your anger into playing a sport can make students more calm when it comes to challenges. Less stress can help students loosen up.\nOverall, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It helps students be healthier and happier, improves their social skills, and opens up more opportunities. Activities benefits both you and your community. Your community can do is support sports by, going to a game. What you can do is, participate in an activity you\'ve never tried before. Open up more opportunities for yourself. See what\'s out there, you\'ll never know until you try.',

        "Schools should allow extracurricular activities and after school programs. It has been proven that most children show an increase in brain activity, creativity, and over all functionality when they have been and/or are currently doing an extracurricular activity. This includes sports such as football, basketball, baseball, soccer and many more outdoor activities that encourage physical health. These activities also include board games like scrabble, chess, and puzzles that help with brainÂ growth, comprehension and critical thinking skills.\nExtracurricular activities are always something someone should at leastÂ think about indulging one's self in. In any case an extracurricular activity could help you with a lot of obstacles in life; such as social struggles like making friends or speaking up in class or maybe less expressive things like focus and paying attention. These activities also help with confidence, self esteem and to a certain extent humility. Most extracurricular's teach teamwork and cooperation and in many cases how to make friends and conflict resolution. This usually resolves in great social and communication skills.\nAfter school activities and extracurricular activities in addition don't just help with mental and/or physical health, but they also do a lot for one's future as well. An extracurricular activity in the future could be used as a credit for a job or college regime; even allow a person to earn a scholarship for the activity that they have chosen to participate and even excelÂ in. Although most esteemed colleges do offer scholarships for physical sports, others often give scholarships for more academicÂ extracurricular's such as debate, mathematics and common knowledge quizzers. This is a great reason to motivate one to take on an extracurricular and better one's self.\nExtracurricular activities have become very important in the modern world. This because of the over usage of cellularÂ devices, most people don't talk face to face or even go outside at all. It is important that people indulge in extracurricular activities so that they can create a face to face sense of understanding and friendship in an environment where everything is digital. The needÂ for extracurricular activities is dire and has to comeback before the value of friendship is lost. Extracurricular activities maybe one of the most important things in this day and age.",

      essay:
        "I agree with the principal that students should engage in some type of activity outside of school and their current form of education. If students were to do so, then they could meet others who share the same interests, which would benefit all students because they are doing things that they like to do, and at the same time, they are sharing the experience with others who enjoy doing the same activity. Extracurricular activities can help students to find and learn about a skill, whether it's one they've never tried before or one they havent had time to look into yet. In addition, extracurricular activities can help students later on in life when they are in college, applying for a job, or any point in their lives beyond that. The principal has chosen to require students to attend an extracurricular activity, which is not only beneficial to them in many ways, but also to everyone elseÂ when the students go out into the world and spread their gifts and talents.\nOne way that students could be helped by learning an extracurricular activity is that they can meet some new people that they might not have ever met before. Students can become friends with them since they have a bond over the activity that they are both interested in. However, some students are shy and/or have fears of social interactions, which can cause them to avoid these activities, but extracurricular activities can actually help get those timid and quiet students to express themselves through the activity. Sometimes, these students are alone and have no friends, which can lead to them feeling down, as well as anxious; extracurricular activities can help prevent these students from being isolated, and can also help them to relax by eleviating the anxiety that they might feel when they are alone. If students become more extroverted in this manner, then they will feel good about doing an activity that they want to do, which can possibly make them feel better so they are happier and less pessimistic.\nThe additional requirement of an extracurricular activity is opposed by some students who say that it wastes their time and interferes with their schedule that is always packed. Having a packed schedule is not always a good idea because it could physically and mentally stress the human body; a way to vent this stress is through an extracurricular activity where students can focus on what they're passionate about instead of what stresses them. Other students who disagree say that they don't know what type of activity they want to participate in; thanks to the wide variety of choices available, they will most likely find either an activity that matches their interests or one that helps them to learn something new. Another pro is that they can choose an activity such as Homework Club that assists them in getting their work done so they don't have as much to do. If students really enjoy an activity, they may choose to major in that activity in college, consider it as a job, or at least find it useful sometime later in life, which disproves the argument that extracurricular activities won't ever help anyone.\nSome students don't have access to certain materials and items at home and are barely getting by because minorities often get less money than the majority does, which can unfairly deny them the chance to do the activities that they like doing; extracurricular activities are usually held at and/or sponsored by schools that receiveÂ enough money, which gives these underprivileged students a chance to finally participate in extracurricular activities. These minorities are often lonely and neglected, so a mandatory extracurricular activity will help them to feel included in a larger group.\nIn conclusion, I truly believe that it is necessary to add an extracurricular activity to the school curriculum because it can lead to so many good results. Requiring them will lead to students feeling less alone and stressed, as well as finding ways to help reduce that stress and include all students. It will help minority groups to be able to engage in activities that they have previously been unjustly impeded from doing. It will also allow students to find others who are passionate about similar things, which might lead to them becoming friends.Â Lastly, it will help to prepare students for their future, even if the activity they like to do doesn't seem that useful. For these reasons, I agree with the principal's decision to make an extracurricular activity mandatory.",

      essay:
        "The principal can decide a lot of things, but not decide what a student does before or after school. I disagree with the principal's idea of making all students do one extracurricular activity. First issue is, it extends an already drawn out school day, making the day last an extra hour or two. Also, a student's talent may not represented in a club, therefore making them feel left out. Finally, students may have outside of school routines, or work they must do, and this rule interferes with their routine. This idea is taking away a bit more of a student's free will, thus leading to my argument. I disagree with the idea of making all students participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because it extends an already long school day, could make students feel left out because their talent isn't represented, and can interfere with a students after schoolÂ or before school routine. Now, onto a more in-depth look.\nFirst of all, the school day issue. School can already be long and tiring, so there's no need to make it longer for students. While some may enjoy sports or other extracurricular activities, those who do not are wasting their time by doing an activity they may not enjoy. Students typically only have around 5 hours of free time outside of school. Add an extra two hours and now they have 3 hours, and some of that time will be used to do homework leaving little time to do what they enjoy. This can stress students out and lead to depression, and make them dread going to school because the entire day is eaten up by it. Along with these points, a student may not have a club or activity they fit into, leading me to my second point.\nNext up, students may not have their talents represented in clubs or activities. Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something.\nFinally, it may interfere with a student's before or after school routine. In the morning, most students have a routine they follow. If they have an activity that begins 45 minutes before school, they have to rearrange their whole schedule. This can lead to them losing sleep, not getting a good enough breakfast, and generally under preparedÂ for school. If a student has an after school activity, this can change and shorten their routine. If they get home, do homework, play games for 2 hours, eat dinner, shower, and then go to sleep, an activity can limit these things to less games or enjoyable activities, not as much of a dinner, and the day being taken up by mostly homework. It can cancel their time to relax or have fun, and cause a routine change. It shouldn't be up to the school to choose a students after or before school life, and throw off their entire schedule.\nTo summarize, I disagree with the principal's idea. It lengthens out a long school day, can make students feel left out, and can mess with a student's schedule. It doesn't seem fair for the school to control a student's out of school time. While school is important, it shouldn't be a student's entire life, they need breaks from it. Clubs, activities, and sports are balanced because people who want to be in them join them, not because they have to. Other people can suffer from a student not participating in their activity making it not enjoyable for others. The school shouldn't choose a student's out of school life.",
