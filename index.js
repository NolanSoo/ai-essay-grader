    ESSAY:
      "Have you ever wondered where your best friend was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.\n\nSigning up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve racking but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.\n\nTheres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.\n\nSometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.\n\nMy first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.   ",

    ESSAY:
      "Our principle has recently stated to all the students of SCHOOL_NAME that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity. Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.\n\nMusical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.\n\nMusical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.\n\nAnother great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.\n\nFinally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.\n\nI stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.          ",

      "Students should be able to choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not for many reasons. Most students are busy and don't want added pressure on top of school work. While kids may want to do extraculliculars they may do out of school activities that can take up their time, or they might have a family to take care of. Many students also a lot of time for homework, which they won't get the time for in an extracurricular.\n\nA reason students student's may not want to do an extracurricular is because they might have out of school obligations. If a student was babysitting or tutoring someone, they wouldn't have time to do extraculliculars because they'd be busy doing another job. It would be unfair to force someone who has another job to do more work, which is why they should have the choice to do an extracurricular activity.\n\nFurthermore, some students could have a family to take care of when they get home. For example, if a student has a younger sibling that needs to be picked up from the bus stop, the student would have to help with that. If they were forced to do an extracurricular, they wouldn't have time to take care of their sibling.\n\nIn addition, quite a few students would need more time to do homework, which an extracurricular would prevent them from doing. While some students can finish their homework quickly and have enough time for another activity, a student who takes a long time shouldn't be rushed into doing something else. If they need more time to do their homework, they shouldn't be dragged into doing an activity.\n\nIn conclusion, students have out of school activities, family to take care of, and a lot of homework which can make it hard for them to focus on extracurricular activities on top of it. All in all, there are many reasons a student might not want to do an extracurricular. Because of this, a student should be able to have a choice to do another activity or not.",

    ESSAY:
      "Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.\n\nRequiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social. Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.\n\nThese activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.\n\nAnother benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students. When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.\n\nIn conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",

    ESSAY:
      "Does sitting inside and doing nothing but homework and chores all day sound exciting? Or would you rather have an opportunity to do fun activities with other people, making friends and improving your health along the way? If the latter sounds like the more appealing option, than you should support our principal's decision to make taking an extracurricular program mandatory. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is the perfect choice for our school. That is because it opens up new and unexpected opportunities, provides an outlet to make new friends, and helps improve your physical and mental well being.\n\nYou should support the requirement of an extracurricular because it opens up fun and enjoyable activities that you might not have come across if not for this new policy. A very sporty kid might never know that he really enjoys being on the student council unless he tries it, and it is unlikely that he would try it any other way. The same thing works inversely, a book-smart kid could really have a great time playing basketball or football and never know it unless he tries it. The new opportunities can also help your in-school life by helping you learn about certain topics that you are struggling in or by providing service hours to contribute towards your required amount. The activity would also be a place to go every time you would rather not go home or if you just preferred to stay after school with your friends.\n\nThe same way that this policy provides an outlet to new activities that you might not have found otherwise, it also paves the way to making you friends that you wouldn't have been friends with in any other situation. If you are a new addition to a certain group and you feel lost with how much more accustomed everyone else is to the group, you could make friends with an elder statesmen type of the group, in a mentor-apprentice kind of way. Many times, you could find people who are in the same situation that you are. If you got to know them and started working together with them, you could both benefit by learning how the group works. Overall, it would just be a fantastic way to gain friends, especially with people who are having a hard time getting to know new people.\n\nAnother great way that this program is going to help is how it improves your physical and mental health. School can get very stressful at times, and the amount of homework, studying, test-taking, and other school things on top of the everyday teenage problems that you have can start to feel draining, like a heavy weight being pushed down on you. Extracurricular programs relieve a lot of that stress by being a place where you can slow down a little bit and be more involved in things you actually enjoy being involved in. The physical activities, such as baseball or basketball, are a great place to get some exercise in to improve your physical life. A lot of students this age have it rough in that they might not have a lot of friends or people to talk to, so just a simple activity like the yearbook club could help relieve an immense amount of emotional weight off of that student by actually giving them someone to talk about their problems to.\n\nThe intelligent choice by our principal to make at least one extracurricular program mandatory is an incredibly beneficial choice to all who are involved. It is a policy that gives people new chances to find something that they like doing, helps students make friends with people that they likely wouldn't have otherwise, and improves the physical and mental health of those students who need the improvement. If you are for the well-being of students and the developmental growth of the people who are the future of our nation, then you should be for this policy. ",

      "Do you ever wish that you could have the chance to do a fun activity during or after school? Some schools are making students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can start new friendships, and in could be fun.\n\nDoing extracurricular activities can start new friendships. If you find someone with the same interest as you, then you two may become friends. It can be hard for people to meet new friends, but if you find someone with a similar interest then it could be easier to become friends with them. Secondly you guys could do activities together. If you two were to both to play an instrument, then you could practice together. Doing an extracurricular activity could give you topics to talk about with friends. If your at lunch one day and you run out of things to talk about, your extracurricular activity could be a good topic. If you miss out on an opportunity for an extracurricular activity, then you could be missing out on an amazing friendship\n\nParticipating in extracurricular activities could be fun. first off there are field trips. Why wouldn't you want to skip a day of school and hang out with friends on a fun field trip? Also you get to do something you enjoy. It can give you a little extra time doing what you love. Lastly it can open up new opportunities. Things like band and orchestra may have festivals or auditions that you could do. Extracurricular activities can give you lots of chances to have fun, and enjoy school a little more.\n\nHowever, some people may say that students will lose interest. They say picking the wrong topic could lead to a year of being board. This could make students dislike the class or not want to go to it. Although, most students say that they enjoy their extracurricular activity, and even if its not their favorite class, they don't dread going to it. For example if a student liked science class more than yearbook, that doesn't mean that the student doesn't want to go to school. But if a student really didn't like the class, then they would know in the future not to pick it again. It would at the least give a student direction on if they would want to do that activity again. Even though people say that kids will lose interest in the activity they choose, students will always be able to get something out of it.\n\nHaving to do an extracurricular activity could lead to new friendships and a year of fun. Being able to experience a extracurricular activity can be a great way to open yourself up to new things, and try different activities. You'll never know what you missed out on if you don't take an extracurricular activity. ",

      "Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity such as a sport or a club. I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because it helps build friendships, raise your low grades, and allows you to experience new things.\n\nThe first reason after school activities are beneficial is that they can build a strong and lasting friendship. I remember when I was in elementary school and my mom signed me up for after school basketball. The first few days and even weeks I hated it. I had no friends there or even someone I had seen before. I was scared and shy. Most of the kids were way older than me and looked huge. Most days I sit on the sideline watching them, wishing I could be that good. Suddenly the tallest kid of them all walks up to me and asked if I would like to join them in a game. I was in shocked and happy at the same time. I told the boy I would love to join. every day after that for three years I played with them after school. Eventually me and that boy became best friends and didnt do anything without each other. We played basketball together, watched movies, played cops and robbers, and had sleepovers. Five years later we are still best friends.\n\nThe second reason after school activities are beneficial is because they can help raise your grades and test scores. Studies show that students who participate in homework clubs and study clubs generally have higher test scores. This means the students who have higher grades can get into better colleges, and students in better colleges can get higher paying jobs. From just attending after school homework clubs students have already made a step towards their goals of getting a good high paying job to support their family.\n\nThe third reason after school activites are beneficial is because they allow students to experience new things. At my middle school we have so many different clubs and activities that everyone can find something they enjoy. I wish I could experience every single club we have but that is just not possible. Before I joined the cooking club I could only use a microwave and toaster. The amazing teacher taught me how to bake and make really fancy dishes for family gatherings or holidays. Before this class my Mom and Grandma cooked for Christmas. Now that I am able to help it feels wonderful because it is more time that I can use to bond with my family and friends.\n\nIn conclusion I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because they are great places to build friendships, improve your grades, and experience new things.       ",

      '"Good morning students, this is your morning announcements. This is your principle speaking. I would like to make an announcement that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity this year. Thank you for listening." "That sounds like a great idea. I can do track this year," I said. "I can do drama club this year," said the girl that sat behind me. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.\n\nMaking friends is something that everyone wants to do during the school year. While playing a sport, you can make good friends, and do the sport you really like. When I did track last year, I made many great friends. The friends you make in school, might have a chance to grow up to still being one of your best friends. Making new friends can help increase your social life and have someone to talk to. Studies show that people that have many friends, tend to live longer, and have a happier life. But people that have don\'t have any friends, shows that they don\'t live as long. Doing clubs can also have a chance to make many friends. By doing drama club, theater club, or a robotics club, new people that you meet might have the same interests as you, and the two can share things they like to do and do as a hobby. This creates bonds with other people and groups. These bonds can eventually create friendships.\n\nDoing sports in something people really like to do as a hobby. They can be physical sports or non-physical sports that they can participate in. People also like to be active in clubs such as the yearbook club, drama club, or even the robotics club. Extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and active, so students can have fun. Competing in sports is something athletes enjoy because of the competition with the other teams, and to see who is the better team. Clubs also compete with other clubs, including the robotics club. They build their machine, and then they compete to see which school has the better machine. Being active in activities would be fun for all students because they involve students being active and having them do fun activities.\n\nBy doing many activities may spark someones mind that they want to do what they want in the future. If a student does drama club or theater in school, they might try out for the activity in high school, or do a play as their career. If a student plays football in middle school, they might try out in high school and get a scholarship to play in college. Then, they can get drafted into the NFL as their career. It\'s a hard task, but anything you put your mind to, you can do it. If the student doe not want to play a sport, be in the yearbook club, or do drama, they can run for student council. This may have the student want to run for student council and win. Running for student council includes many things you would to in other activities, including competition, planning,and confidence. This may have the student be interested in politics. They could even run for an election when they grow up.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it would be a great idea for the principal to have all student participate in extracurricular activities. In addition, I was on the track team for two years an I made many friends because of trying out. I also got to learn more about sports and I know many people would want to do these activities for a career. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.            ',

      "The Principal is making all the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity and while some people may think that this is the greatest thing,and that they are going to love it,others may think that this was a huge mistake and that they won't do any good for them. I think that people need to try an extracurricular activity to get a feel for it. Sure some students may try out for a sports team or a team in general,but they are never finding out their true potential and will leave it in the dust. I think the Principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity because you can make friends,find something you didn't know you were good at till now,and make a living out of it.\n\nThe principal should let everyone take a extra curricular activity is because you can make new friends. You can make new friends by talking to the people in your activity. You can find people and become friends by talking to them,becoming really close to them,and becoming friendly with them. You can also find people that you have in common. There's people that I have met that have the same likes,interests,and dislikes,and we became really great friends just by having a few things in common,so you guys should try finding someone and seeing if you have a lot of things in common with him or her. You can also find your future best friend or your soon to be best friend. You can find a person,hit it off with them,and become best friends in the long run just because of that one extra curricular activity. In conclusion I think you can make new friends in a extra curricular activity by being friendly,finding people who have the same likes and dislikes as you,and find a best friend.\n\nAnother reason the Principal should let students take one extra curricular activity because you might find something you didn't know you were good at. You can find something you didn't know you were good at because of the many options that schools have. Over fifty activities in schools around the world! From basketball,soccer,and football,form even cooking. Schools have something that might suit you. So if you don't like soccer or any sports,there's always cooking or Cosmetics. You can make teams and become popular and active. For sports such as soccer and softball,you can make the teams and get popular making a lot of friends in the process. You can make money by trying out for a sport. Once you get into high school,you can earn credits and even a college application which saves a lot of money. I think we should take an extracurricular activity because they have many options,you can be active and popular,and you can make or save money.\n\nI think everyone should take at least one extra curricular activity because you can become know for the best basketball or best soccer player one day. Kobe Bryant and Micheal Jordan are perfect examples of people who started in basketball in probably high school as a extra curricular activity,to one of the Greatest players of all time. On the other Extra curricular activity come off as useless and left in the dust. People just take it for granted and just want the easy A.They don't try to discover their true potential and leave it in the dust. I think that an extra curricular activity is fun and may or may not get you famous,but on the other hand people just seem to abuse it's power.\n\nIn conclusion I think that the principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity just because if how fun it is. Taking an extra curricular activity means that you can make new friends and best friends,do something that you didn't know you were good at till now and become popular and active,and be famous just like other famous people around the globe. But one the other hand people just seem to not care. In conclusion I think that the principle should let students take at least one extra curricular activity but not make it a rule so that other people will not feel uncomferable and forced to take an extra curricular activity.",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine if you had to do an extracurricular activity at school with no say otherwise. Extracurricular activities are meant for a fun, optional, learning experience. Most schools offer activities for student interests. Students like the option of extracurricular activities because they can participate in their interests if they want to but it isn't mandatory like most other things in school. I disagree that students should be forced to do extracurricular activities because students should have the choice of what they want to do, most students are busy with other things outside of school, and students may not be interested in what their school offers.\n\nStudents shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because they should have the choice of what they want to do. Schools offer activities so students can participate in things they want do, not have to do. Being forced to participate in things a student doesn't want to do can stress them out. Most things in school are mandatory so students like not feeling the pressure of being forced to do something. Making students participate in extracurricular activities can have benefits too. It would make them go out and do something and help them learn new skills. In the end multiple downsides outweighs a few benefits. While there may be benefits to forcing students to go and do something, in the end they should have their own choice of what they want to do or not do.\n\nAnother reason why students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities is because most students are already busy with other things outside of school. Forcing more upon them would stress them out and make them dislike school. Students already dread each night they go home because of all their homework so making them have even more to do will over stress them leading to depression and lack of effort. While it is good to challenge students to help them find their full potential, overworking them can lead to problems with their health and efforts during school. Extracurricular activities are supposed to make learning fun and help students learn new skills, not make them dread every day of school. Overworking students when they are already busy leads to anxiety and stress which is why extracurricular activities shouldn't be mandatory.\n\nThe last reason why schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities is because some students may not be interested in what their school offers. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students discover what their interests are, not force them to do things they don't care for. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students know what they might be interested in doing in the future. If a student doesn't have interest in any of their schools options, they shouldn't be forced to do them. Some students may only have interests in things they can't do at their school. While some students might have interests that their school offers, not everyone does making it unfair for everyone to have to do an activity. If schools make students do things they don't want to, they will start questioning if their schools cares about their opinion or interests.\n\nIn the end, students should have the choice of whether or not they want to do extracurricular activities since some are busy with other things and others aren't interested in what is offered. Overall, I have proved why I think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. Between being forced to do extracurricular activities and having a choice, having a choice is definitely the right answer. I chose that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they should be able to make their own choices, even if it isn't always the best answer.",

      "I agree because maybe it could lead to new friendships or relate able things or a thing with a teacher. For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activities or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decided to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do. Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activities at school or outside of school it's because they want you to feel like you've like accomplished everything in life and you've decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire. You might even find your furture date and be very distance get to know each other so I am agreeing because it causes friendships doesn't have to be home all day and some thing you might like.",

      "Sometimes, students all they want to do, is be on their phones all day and do nothing,i would recommend that students join an activity they enjoy, and effects them in their future career. In that case, I agree with the principal's decision, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons for my decision are students can become more successful,and they can prepare for what they want to be when they grow up.\n\nMy first reason is, students can be more successful, and by that i mean better grades. nowadays kids grades drop really low because they are late to class,skip school,or don't pay attention, young teenagers miss a lot of information given by their teacher by not doing what they are supposed to. Staying after school with teachers can catch them up with their work, and help them achieve better goals.\n\nHowever,activities can prepare young adults, for what they want to be went they grow up. If the student want's to be a professional player they might as well join a sport and practice new skills. Or if a students want to be a chef like the pionneer woman that sells pans and utensils,they could join a cooking class after school. Or somehow they want to be an actor or actress,stay after for more practices in the Drama club.\n\nWouldn't you want to see your kids graduating college with a master degree? Yes, every parent wishes that for their kids. In that matter students could join extracurricular activities,do community hours, prepare for what they want to be, and be successful.",

      "All students should have a decision if they want to play a extracurricular sport. One reason is that some students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and doing homework stuff like that. Next, reason is students might not like the sports that are given to play, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not given that much attention to school, because they are so into the sport they are playing. So, i think students should have a choice to play a extracurricular sport.\n\nOne reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, that they don't have enough time to play a extracurricular activity. Students might have a job to do after school, like working, have to babysit there sister, and get somebody off the bus everyday, etc. Students don't have enough time to do an sport, and have responsibilities to do too. Therefore, Students have responsibilities to do that doesn't require doing an activity that can take time away from doing that.\n\nNext reason is students might not like the activity given to play. Someone might not appreciate or like the activity they have to play, because they don't know how to play or just to lazy to play it with others. Students nowadays like to choice what they want to play not what others want them to play; because they might not like the activity given to them. For example they might have got picked to play soccer, they never played soccer so they may not like to play; because they never played that exact activity. Therefore, they should play what they played or seen get played by them or others.\n\nLastly, students are not paying enough attention in school. They are so focused on that one activity that they forget about what is happening around them. Students give so much attention into something not that much important as school and there grades. There grades are dropping because they skip half of class just to do an activity, they never make it up because so into what happened during that activity time. Therefore, school should come first before any sport and everything else avoiding that school time.\n\nIn conclusion, students should have a decision to what they want to do for there after school activity. One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and getting younger kids off the bus, etc. Another reason is students might not like that activity given to them, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school, because they are so into that activity. To sum this up no i don't think every student should have to play an activity if they don't like or don't have enough time, or not paying attention in class.",

      'Imagine every single student at your school is associated/participating in a sport, helping the yearbook committee, or even just serving on the student council because it could greatly impact the school by making it more organized and "healthier". Well thats exactly what my principle has decided to do. But not only can this change how there doing in school, it can also affect how they are struggling financially with all the fees they have to pay.\n\nTime plays an important role in this because a lot of students wont be able to fit an extra material into there daily schedules because there already jam packed with other things they need to do throughout the day. This is also a little cruel for students because they would have to be occupied with numerous things at once and still remember to do other things. If the principles say that we must do an extracurricular activity, we wont have any time to do our own things. Students dont like to be stressed out and having to do lots of things at once. We already get tons of homework that some of us dont even finish because of the time we have isnt enough. So students might even stop turning in homework on time or even at all. Because focusing on other things has made it harder for them to keep up with school work. And then the student is blamed on for not doing it, but its not really there fault that they dont have enough time at home to finish everything. Students are getting the time taken away that they could use to do something that they enjoy like; spending time with there pets, relaxing, hanging out with friends etc. And that could affect how there school performance is going. Also they time they should be using as homework there turning in there free time because they dont have any other time for themselves.\n\nMoney is also a problem in this situation because not everyone is going to have the necessary money needed to pay off the fees, or to get the materials needed for the activity they have chosen to do. But if the school offers to help pay the fees, then it would be a lot easier for those who need help financially. Im not saying they should pay the full price, but that they could help pay some of it, and the family getting helped does too;so that way they are both contributing. If money support isnt an option for them, then they just wont be able to participate and that should be blamed on the school not the family because its not their fault there struggling and cant afford to pay there children activities that the school says they "must" do. But whats the school going to do if they dont? suspend them? I think not.\n\nMost students wouldnt even want to participate in an extra curricular activity because they are already stressed out at home and have other things to deal with. Maybe the student is going through a rough time and doesnt want to be pressured into doing something extra thats just going to worsen there problem. So they shouldnt be forced to do something they dont want.\n\nOverall the schools shouldnt be doing this because its just a waste of time, money, and academic time. students already have a handful of things they need to keep up with for example: homework, they usually get it everyday with every class; that is already stressful enough. Religious activities like attending church or going to mutual, babysitting for friends or family, or even just spending time with friends,family and even pets. But with the school making us do other extracurricular activities, we wont have time do to what we enjoy and make us happy. ',

      "I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.\n\nParticipating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.\n\nAn extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.\n\nI positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular. They don't even have to take up that much time. There are an amazing amount of opportunities and benefits that come from them that shouldn't be passed. It could just be something to do after school, or it could be what you love to do. An extracurricular is great for everybody.",

Some of them can be boring making people not want to do them. Then theres some people that love doing activitys like that. It shouldn't be up to the principal if they want to participate in them or not.\n\nThere is just some people that can't participate in things like sports , if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then. But for now they're just for fun and now days teenagers just want to hangout with friends and be on their phone. There is some people that barely get to spend time with their family because they're so busy so they don't have time for activitys.\n\nWith sports being a extracurricular activity there is some people that can't afford is because it can be exspincve and some kids/families don't have the money for that. Theres some kids that would love to do things like sports , but don't have transpartion or money and some schools don't always have rides for students to get back and forth.\n\nSome students can't participate in things like that because they get in to much trouble *they only do it like that at some schools*\n\nI don't really see a point of having to do a extracrricular activity theres just no point. I don't think trying it once would hurt to see if you like it or not! If our principal made us do this i feel like it should be once a mouth because other people have other things to do and are busy , and i feel like the students should be able to pick what activity they want to do or not. And the teachers should put it in as a grade if they participate or not.\n\nEnd of teh story , i think theres no point in extracurricular activitys.",

      "I was in the hallways looking for an after school activity I couldn't find one that I liked or seemed interesting. The principal made it so that everyone has to do an extracurricular activity after school. I disagree with this decision.\n\nI disagree with this decicion because some people just don't get along with others and those activities require them to talk to people they may not like. Some people are shy and get nervous talking to people. Others are rude and don't like people in general, and people don't want to talk to them. Some people just can't make friends because they're funny looking. People like those anime kids probably can't make friends either because they stay hissing at people and having crushes on cartoon charaters. People can be depressed and not want to do anything after school just go home and lay in their bed the rest of the day.\n\nIf someone has do to a sport because there is no other activities to do them they won't enjoy what they're doing. Even if they end up liking it they are doing it for fun not because they want to win everygame. Also is it's a sport you are making thwem spent their money on something you forced them to do. They could have used that money for something that they actually need like food or for paying their bills but no you want them to pay for a jersey, shoes, special socks and they didn't even want to do the sport in the first place. Their family could be really struggling to pay the rent and you want them to give you $100 for a jersey.\n\nSome people might not even enjoy being out doors or they might not be in the mood to be doing stuff like that they just want to go home to their dog or to their nice and comfertable bed but no you want them to spend more energy on after school stuff and teachers already complain about how some kids never do their work and thye dotn care what the excuse is. Someone could say \"Sorry I couldn't do my homework my grandpa died yesterday\" and the teacher would say \"that's tough you should have done before he died you had time then didn't you\" and with everyone doing after school activities there is no time for homework because you get home around six or seven then you eat because you must be starving then you take a shower and boom it's time to sleep and you got no homework done.\n\nI disagree with the decision to make everyone have an after school activity becuase not everyone has time or the personality to be hanging out with random people everyday after school. Some people might be depressed and others can't make friends. Not everyone has the money for supplies they need for their activity.

      "Did you ever have an extracurricular activity or also known as an after school activity in school? Some students after school participate in clubs or sports like the year book, student council, or football. Now some schools they may require you to participate in an after school activity, and others may not. Personally i am against it because many students work after school, many students have no interest in any, and many students who dont want to be there will be a distraction to those who do want to be there.\n\nFirst there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. If they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. They may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. If you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.\n\nSecondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. Maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. Now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. If they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.\n\nLastly it could cause stress. School puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. Have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. Some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. Some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.\n\nIn conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. Now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. Its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.",

    ESSAY:
      "How would you feel if everyday after eight hours of sitting at a table, righting down notes, listening to someone talk to you about something you may or may not like, getting up for five minutes just for it to happen again, and then when the bell rings instead of going home you go into another classroom to do an activity you dont like and didnt choose? Because that is what it would be like for students if they had mandatory extracurricular activities. Every student having to go to a after school has been a very debated issue for a long time. Mandatory extracurricular activities have their benefits, but their cons out weigh them. The principal of Generic_School middle school has decided that this is false, and that every person going to a after school is a great idea. I disagree with this, and here's why. Students should not have to attend extracurricular programs because of their freedom of choice, not all after schools are equal, and because of the funds needed for them.\n\nFirst Students should have the ability to choose which after school program they would like to go to. One reason they should be able to do this is they can spend more time with their family which is very important in this stage of their life. Another is that they could choose to do homework instead which I think is something many of them would rather do. Finishing homework gives a senses of relief that it is over and you have nothing to be concerned about. My last reason to support this is letting students make their own decisions makes them more independent as well as learn life lessons you cant get in school. For example they could decided that \"I want to put in one and a half hours into my homework, thirty minutes to study, one hour to have dinner, and four hours of free time.\"\n\nSecondly not all of the extracurricular activities the school provides are equal. This is shown in how much time some activities require. Specifically a student may have to go to basketball practice very day while a person in the art club only goes once a week. The next way they are unequal is in how much effort is put into the after school. An example of this is a teen in the book club would need to put in far less effort than someone on the debate team.\n\nThe third way extracurricular programs are not equal is in how much is costs to run them. For instance In the art club they use lots of very expensive materials like paints, canvases, and clay. This would cost much more that the soccer team that only needs to replace soccer balls and goals. This leads me to my next reason why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools\n\nThe last reason as to why we should not have mandatory extracurricular programs is the amount of money needed to support all of the activities. Having enough after schools so that all of the kids will be able to go to them will put a lot of strain on the schools finances. This will result in the school not being able to adequately educate their students during the actual school day. If the burden of whos to pay for the extracurricular activities does not fall on the school it will fall on others in one of two ways. The first way is they will charged the parents of the kids directly. Many family's cant pay the cost of the after schools even if they wanted to making the the school still suffer a loss. The second way is to raise taxes which will give parents a lesser financial burden than charging them directly, but will make taxes high for others who don't have kids and will surely not go down well.\n\nIn conclusion being able to choose which extracurricular activity you desire, the after school programs being unequal, and the cost to run them are all very good reasons why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools. If you agree with this than wright a letter to your or our school board telling them your own reasons as to why schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities. By righting this I hope to prevent the horrible experience that I described to you and let you go home after exactly eight hours.",

      "Do you like different activities? This one time I didn't want to participate in an activity. Even though you don't want to participate in the activity, it will still help you. Then other people will remember you in life. I agree with the principal's approach because it can help you later in life, it can get you more involved with great things, and it can possibly make you famous.\n\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity can help you later in life. It can help you because people would be there for you. More and more people will know you and help you out with the rest of your life. Basically what I'm saying is the more people know you the more it will help. Now that's how people know how bad you want help later in your life.\n\nAnother effect of participating in an extracurricular activity is it will get you more involved with different activities. Just like the second paragraph this is one is great too. When you get more involved its good for you because you meet different people and famous people. Thats how it can help you later in life. When you participate in an extracurricular activity, its almost like the start of a new adventure.\n\nOne more thing of participating in an extracurricular activity is that it can possibly make you famous. Now this is the best part of this adventure. How you can be famous from one thing just like that you ask? Well there are people watching you. You could be an National Football League star, a professional Newsreporter, or maybe the next President of the United States.\n\nNow I think people should agree with the principal's new approach because you could be the changer of this world. Even though you think you don't want to, you can still try it and you just might like it. The best part of being famous you are the boss, and you could change the country forever possibly. All you have to do is try an extracurricular activity. Come on try it people try it. You will miss out if you don't get more involved. It's not too late to agree with the principal's approach. ",

      "Once my sister noticed she didn't get into the collage she wanted, she fell on the ground and cried her eyes out. She wished she had gone back to do more activities when she was younger, but there was no turning back now. Participating in activities are very important for every ones future. If someone doesn't participate in something, they wont only get a possibly scholarship, but also might not get the dream job they have wanted. Principals should make people participate in activities such as a club, sport, or student council\n\nIt is good to have social interaction with peers. If someone stays in the house all the time, not going out anywhere, then they might not have a good chance at getting into a collage they wanted. Participating in extracurricular activities might give someone extra points for collage, or make them look good for a collage. On the other hand, if people don't do extracurricular activities they might not be accepted in many collages. It is very important to do exracurricual activities while someone still can!\n\nCertain jobs may check someones background to see what they have done for a living, but if they haven't done anything except for playing video games all day, they might not get the job. Jobs are very important for someones upcoming future. If someone has done a lot of activities in high school, or donated to charity often, they will have a bigger chance of getting a job than someone who hasn't participated in anything.\n\nLaying around all day could cause health issues. If someone just lays around all day they might become very unhealthy and not get the exercise they need, but if you are active and doing activities, that will change the situation for you completely. Moving around is good for ones health. If someone is laying on the couch, scrolling through Instagram all day and never getting up could get them Diverticulitis. Being unhealthy like that could cause serious problems, definitely at such young age.\n\nNot doing school activities will, possibly, affect someones life for the rest of their life. They might not get their dream job, get a good scholarship, or be healthy. Extracurricular activities can change someones life for the better, it is best to do it now than regret it later on in someones life time.",

      "What if your principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity? How would you respond to that? Would you go against them or stand with them? My principal made that decision for our school and I am standing with him! Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school.\n\nExtracurricular activities are an extreme benefit and help to the community. Many clubs actually are made to serve and make changes to the community. However, many people believe that students shouldn't be the ones having to do extra work to help out. It isn't all about the changes or the service it also helps them come together as a community and accomplish things as a team. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community.\n\nBenefiting the students is another thing extracurricular activities do. Students learn many skills such as teamwork, leadership, and responsibility when they take part in these activities. Extracurricular activities teach students many things that they wouldn't learn during school hours or class time. When the students take part in these amazing things, the build an even more amazing reputation for themselves. Many say that students will lose focus and interest in school when they take a part in extracurricular activities. But, in reality extracurricular activities are the reason some students come to school and strive to do their best.\n\nSchools benefit a lot from extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities keep schools motivated and running smoothly. Many extracurricular activities require competition this means they keep healthy competition going. Clubs and teams bring the school closer. Students feel as isn't just a place to do pencil paper work when they can actually do these things and them be associated with school. These activities surely are expensive on school. But, the experiences that they bring students are worth more than a million dollars.\n\nExtracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community. Extracurricular activities are the reason students are great leaders and strive to do their best. These activities help a school build their backbone and the way others see them as a whole. Wouldn't it be amazing if your principal made you take part in these activities!",

      "Do you like doing extracurricular activates at school like sports, yearbook, and student council if not then this is a good place for you. I think this because the kids most of the time get to pick there activity, they can have fun in these activities and make new friends, and they can help you make friends you didn't know. There are a lot of activities you can do and just pick the best one in your opinion and have fun. I think that kids should do this because when school is out and after most kids just sit around and not work but with after school activities kids will use there brain more then if they are just sitting around.\n\nIn school most kids are not interested in school because they think it is boring but most after school programs will,l make it fun thats why kids go there . But in extracurricular activities you can choose what you want to do and you can have a good time. If you like sports then you could play a lot of sports. If you like board games then you can play board games. But if your not good in school then there might be consequences like not choosing your favorite activity. E\n\nxtracuticular activities will help and thats one of the reasons I like them.\n\nIn after school activities you can make friends that have the same interest as you. If you choose it and someone else dose as well then you probably like the same thing. You came make friends that can last you a life time. It helps to know that the other person likes what you like so you can do it together and not come plane about it. Extracurricular activities will help make friends that have the same interests as you and thats one of the reasons i like them.\n\nYou can join a club that is fun and you can get some school help from it as well. It can help you pass a class if you need some extra help in it. It can also be really fun like sports then you probably think they are fun and sometimes you can learn something from that sport. You can do their things like Lego club, reading club, and ext. E\n\nxtracuticular activities will help make friends and thats one of the reasons i like them.\n\nI think that having extracurricular clubs is good and i think that all schools should have it . It is good because most of the time kids get to choose their own club, they can make new friends, and they can be fun and they may help you out with school. I think that they will help kids because kids will be lying around in their house doing nothing after school but when they work it can get there brains going.        ",

      "The principal just announced a new school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate in at least on after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.\n\nFirst of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.\n\nIn this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great.\n\nGoing off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere!\n\nIn conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people. ",

    ESSAY:
      "You have so much to do! You have a pile of homework, youth group, errands, and, on top of that, you have to meet with a club that you don't want to be in. If you force someone to do things that they don't want to do, there can be a lot of negative effects. As a result, I don't think that participating in an extracurricular should be required because people who are forced to join something will probably not participate well, could get very stressed and overwhelmed with the extra load, and people who are not already in a club have multiple reasons to not join.\n\nFirst off, if you aren't able to find an extracurricular that you like, you could be forced to join one. Then, if you're forced to join a club that you do not like, that could hinder the group's progress and work. For example, if someone who doesn't know how to play lacrosse joins the lacrosse team, some people would be angry. Especially if the new person doesn't want to play and doesn't know how. They are most likely diving headfirst into the sport without learning the rules. That means they wouldn't know how to check correctly, wouldn't know defense or attack, and wouldn't know the rules for scoring. On top of that, them not wanting to do lacrosse would ruin the team dynamic. We had a player one year who did not want to play on the defense, so she played the position as bad as she could, making the people who were trying to play well angry, and ruining our teamwork. So, if people don't want to participate in a club or sport, they might ruin it for everyone else, and that wouldn't be beneficial.\n\nNext, having an extracurricular on top of everything that you already have to do, like homework or family, could make you stressed and exhausted. I know for me that having lacrosse practice, Odyssey of the Mind, and homework every single day makes me exhausted. I enjoy playing lacrosse, and I enjoy OM, but when I get home from lacrosse after an hour and a half, and having done OM before that, I have exceeded my limits of activity for the day. All that I want to do is take a shower and go to sleep. If I have to do my homework and spend more time working, I will most likely be very tired the next day. With that, other people might have little siblings that they have to take care of, and being in a club, going home and doing their homework, and after that, taking care of siblings, will give them a lot of stress to do everything fast, making them rush their homework to make sure that their sibling are cared for, or neglecting their siblings to do their homework well. Juggling multiple responsibilities can impact stress levels, productivity, and time management.\n\nFinally, people who are not in a club can have multiple reasons not to be in a club. You could choose not to be in a club because your parents can't pick you up afterwards, you have too much homework every night, you have siblings to take care of, etcetera. People who aren't participating in any extracurriculars just might not want the responisibility of remembering. Everyone has a reason, even if it's that it doesn't sound interesting.\n\nJoining an extracurricular should not be forced onto students. I think that if you force someone to do anything that they do not want to, they will not participate and that will come back around to you in negative ways.",

      "If my principle were to require every student to participate in an extra curricular activity, I would disagree. I choose to disagree because, some students might not have the time, parents or adults at home cant take or pick them up, money problems, students are needed at home and, they should be able to have the choice to participate in an extracurricular activity or not. I feel it is unfair to force all students to participate in an activity.\n\nMany students might not have the time to do an extracurricular activity. They could have a lot of homework they must do or, they could be busy doing other things. Parents might also not have the time to bring their kids to the activities and pick them up as well. Many parents work and they might even work until late. How would they be able to transport their kids to and from their activities? From my expirience, my parents are both really busy. My dad goes to work from early in the morning and doesn't get home until about 7PM. He's busy all day. Therefore, he wouldn't be able to to get my siblings or I from our activities. My mom also helps my dad at work, they're both really busy. She has to take my brother and I to our practices everyday then, pick us up. I myself am a busy person. I have practice 5 times a week and they're back to back. Sometimes I have to wait hours to eat and most nights I don't have enough time to do my homework. I go to sleep late and do it all over again the next day. You can't buy time or make it go by slower to get to and from those activities. It all doesn't fit into some peoples scheduals.\n\nForcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity isn't fair for a lot of reasons. Some students might not be interested in sports. Some might not be interested in being on the school council. Some might not be interested in working on the yearbook. Some just might not be interested in any of the activities that are provided. Everyone has different things they like or enjoy doing. Forcing students to do something they don't like, makes them feel uncomfortable or out of place, it isn't fair. It makes them miserable. Schools focus on including everyone but sometimes they don't include how a student feels.\n\nMoney is also an issue. I know for a fact that participating in a sport isn't free. Nothing in this world is ever really free. We never know about a familys money situation but, it's important to keep in mind that some people struggle and that includes even providing food for their family. On top of that housing bills, other bills, insurance, taxes and savings is already a hassle for a family who is struggling. Adding activities that require a payment for an activity that a kid is forced to do is even more unfair and more trouble. It adds too much stress.\n\nIn conclusion, forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity could be an inconvienance as well as unfair. Not a lot of good things come out of a situation like this. The negatives cancel out the positive.        ",

      "Everyone needs a break from something they tend to stress about so they can get there stuff together. Meaning, if you keep pushing yourself to do something your having a hard time on you should take a break and do something you that will calm you down to help you. My principal says that students should attend any type of extracurricular avtivities. Such as art, sports, yearbook, and many more. I agree with my principal with his thought of choice.\n\nHaving fun classes can really help student when they start having a ruff time in school. Class is really stressful for me and others when they don't understand something at school. My happiness is soccer, art, and writing. Those 3 things help me so much. So when i'm strugling the only thing I think about is doing something I know that will keep my mind off of it and will start to calm me down. Art is one of the best class anyone can take. I say this because art, is litearlly art. You can do art out of anger, stress, sadness, and even happiness. Litearally out of anything. If your planning on doing a new sport in high school it can build your stress to even it to be better. I would have to wait all the way until i get home to play soccer, but in high school you will have a period so you can do that sport or activity. You should'nt be forced to keep doing your work without a break from being overwhelmed.\n\nThe more you practice the better you get. I understand when people say the more you study in school the more you understand. Thats not just for school work. It's also for these fun activities. Say you have never done a sport before, but want to start. You can do that in school and then when you sign up for the sport you want to do you will already be really really good, because all the practice you have got. Also, most people in middle school want to do a sport in high school. If you participate in that specific sport the coaches will see that you are really intrested in doing it. You can even do soemthing you never thought you would do, like Yearbok. Yearbok is a fun activityt and you can do a lot. The more you do it the best you get. That can be you new enjoyable hobby. No one ever knows what you can't do.\n\nAlthough, students being allowed to do a fun class during learning hours can get them to lose the thought of there work. Students should focus on school work and schol work only. Especially for those who want a good career in the future. You can actually make a lot of money from art. Art is a easy activity you can do for your whole life, and it will also lead you to big things. The most important thing in my opinion is to do something that will get you somewhere ahead of life. Doing that will help you sucseed within your future. Anyting you enjoy doing as an activity can get you somehwere.\n\nExtracurricular activities should be a new thing students at Hayfield should attend, and many more schools. I think that is a really good idea to allow for us students. No one should be stressed about someting that they need in life, what do you think?",

    ESSAY:
      '"Ughhhh," said Generic_Name, "I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. "Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?" Generic_Name questioned, "well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school," Generic_Name\'s Mom replied. "I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, dont you think so Mom?" Generic_Name said, "I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there," Generic_Name said, "sure honey, I think thats the best idea ever!" Generic_Name\'s Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.\n\nFirst, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at least one school activity tend to be more self confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self-confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self-confident.\n\nSecond, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becoming a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.\n\nThird, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high-school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.\n\nImagine, you have just made your high-school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. Your a great, wise person that everyone looks up to and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouth-watering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.',

      "Dear Principal,\n\nI strongly disagree with you all students should not have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Such as, participateing in sports,work on a yearbook, or serve as a student council.\n\nWho would want to do a extracurricular activity when we already have seven hours of school that's over working us. If we have that added on to school a lot of students will be going to sleep in school. Studies show that in the U.S. 45% of students is going to sleep in school. So, why would you add an extra activity\n\nSo it can waste more of our energy? So we can go to sleep faster?\n\nI strongly advise everyone not to do any type of sports. You will get sore from pratice,injured,break a bone, tear your A.C.L. or worser. Lke in football you can get seriously injured. Why yall want us to do a type of sport we can ge injured in? Studies show that 58% of students get injured by Participating in sports.\n\nWe should just and learn then to do the extracurricular activity. School is for learning right?\n\nWorking on a yearbook is just wasting our learning time while we could be learning about math,reading, or science. We can finsh the yearbook in one day so what's the point of makeing it an activity that's just takeing takeing time from our learning. Matter of fact you can just just select five or six people to do yhe yearbook it's no point of makeing it an activity. By the way way why start this early you should wait until June.\n\nServe as a student council? That's not even an activity that's just for one person so, why should that even be included as an activity? That's not a reason why everybody in the whole school do an extra activity in the school. That's just for that one person. That's not an reason why we should miss out of learning because of an student council. That one person should do that while we learning our education that will be great.\n\nIn conclusion, we should not have to an activity beacuase we come to school for to learn not to no extracurricular activity while we could be studying for the S.O.L. or matbe learning something new. We shouldn't waste time from our learning to do an extracurricular activity while we can be getting our education in an class. If we was to do that activity students will be fallling sleep in class, chance of being injured, chance of getting bone broken, tearing your A.C.L. and etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ",

      'A famous basketball player once said "I never wanted to do sports. Until i tried something new." I agree all students should have to participate in a type of school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about.\n\nFirst of all,students that would be considered shy might need a push to make friends. Maybe putting them in a uncomfortable situation would open their minds into something they would not have expected. Maybe your a \'new kid\' in town and really dont have friends but, you really like Volleyball or Basketball and the school requires you to play you now have people who likes the same things as you.\n\nfurthermore, it gives them something to write on collage applications .collage people love reading about you when you played volleyball or seeing that you were sons school council. you could use that as your collage easy. and if you do a sport is would act as a scholarship if you play you cold go to collage and not have to pay money and things of that nature.\n\nAnother key factor, it gives you something to talk about. maybe your not a great conversation starter and you need help. and is great conversation to have with people how dont know what b they want to do and you have something to talk with your teammates about like "that was a great game "\n\nAnother reason it it gives you a great experiences meaning learn and in general they get a good out looking on different things. For example the learn That they do not like basketball and soccer you still have these skills that you learned while your figuring out you dont like that activity..another example if you some a a famous writer your books can be based off of many different things you activities you did as a child.\n\nIn conclusion as a student i believe that you should participate in a school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about. if you dont play sports now in the future you will regret it .                       ',

    ESSAY:
      "Should the principal be allowed to force decisions on their students? While this may lead to some poor decisions, it would be better in the long run. \"Why?\" you say, you see 70% of kids don't do social or physical activities of any kind, and suffer as a result. There are also a lot of times where kid's are forced to do something new and then end up liking it. Something they never would have done they liked. Along with that, putting kid's through these programs could also give them valuable life skills. Overall, I do think that the principal, or whoever is managing the school, should be allowed to force these programs upon kids.\n\nMy first point I'm going to list is that it get's them doing something. Like I said a lot of kids don't do anything by themselves, and around 2/3 of them have less than three friends. There is a whole outside world waiting for them. It is also noted that these kids more often than not have great talents, which are just waiting to shine. With a stronger school, getting them to go outside, and participate in activities such as clubs, school teams, and the student council would be easy and beneficial, and some of these benefits would be stronger and smarter kids, and more school funding for these programs.\n\nThe second reason I think this should be done, is because of practical reasons. The goal of the school is to cram as much as they can into the student before the year's end. They could also set up after school activities straight after school to do this even better, along with this would help students who don't have parents or guardians at home. Whether this would be mandatory or not is one sided, it must be mandatory. Another practical reasons this should be done is that it would allow more time for the teacher and student to interact helping with the normal school day and settling any problems.\n\nOne thing other people might say is that it would increase costs, and that the school shouldn't be messing with the student's childhood. Both of those accusations are wrong. Doing these has been shown in several studies to not be very expensive, and is literally just a step up from end of day clubs. The second point isn't true either, the school is a part of the student's childhood, and they should be embracing it. Younger generations haven't learned what and what not to do yet, and the school can help them decide.\n\nIn the end, I do think that the principal should be able to force activities like these upon the students, to improve their live skills, and maybe provide a bit of fun. Of course, the United States is a republic, so it all depends on the parent's, but I do think they will agree with what I say, that children shouldn't be sitting in their bed all lazy, but be making important life choices.\n\nNow what do I think you think of this? Even if you are just a student, and not a parent of teacher who already knows all the benefits, it is for your personal future, and it will be better for you. Tell other people about this idea, and eventually it will be national education.",

      '"\n\nYour principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree or disagree with this decision?"\n\nExtracurricular activities are some ways that students use their free time after school. On average, about 65% of all in students in Virginia participate in a extracurricular activity such as a sport, club etc.. I think that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity because it will help students with their college applications, students can find new interests, and students can meet new people.\n\nFirstly, it will help students have a better, stronger, college application. Extracurricular activities are a strong factor on college applications. According to one of the admission officers at Harvard University,\n\n"students are 10x more likely to get into an ivy league or higher ranked university, if he/she has more extracurriculars on their application."\n\nMany colleges like to see extracurriculars on an application, rather than not.\n\nSecond, students are gonna be able to find new interests. Students are more likely gonna find their passion for something if they do an extracurricular. Helping students find their passion in something can help them take classes with their interests and help them improve in that skill set required for their passion. In my experience, having extracurriculars helped me find interest for many of the things I love today.\n\nLastly, extracurricular activities can help students meet new people. Meeting new people is probably the best part of doing extracurricular activities. Extracurriculars are good for students to meet others that share the same interests as them. For example students who tend to be more quieter and to themselves can have an easier time opening up to new people they\'ve met if they like the same thing, and this can lead to them creating lifelong friendships with them.\n\nConclusively, helping students with their college applications, students finding their passion, and helping students meet new people are reasons why principals should require an extracurricular activity amongst all students. These extracurriculars can benefit a students school, and social life in a positive way. Requiring students to do an extracurricular of their interest can lead them to enjoying arriving and being at school more than before. Extracurriculars can also highly affect a students future in many positive ways.',

She finally arrives with a hungry smile and cruel eyes and says,"Generic_Name did you do your homework?"."No i did not teacher because I had no time due to the outrageous rule that the principal made that made it mandatory that all students participate in one extracurricular activity." Her eyes gleamed with anticipation as she gave Generic_Name an F and walked off to seek her next victim. The rule that dictates that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity is a mutiny and should be abolished at once because,students can use the extra time for more beneficial uses such as doing their homework or catching up on some sleep,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.\n\nThe first reason why the rule that states that you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be nullified is,that students can use the extra time for more productive purposes such as doing homework or catching up on some sleep. When i was younger I used to participate in writing club and when I would come back home I would be drained. I would have no energy to do anything so the majority of the time my assignments went incomplete and turned into zeros. One day the teachers started noticing the lack of turned in assignments and called my parents for a parent teacher conference. the teachers brought me and my parents to a table wearing serious expressions. The teacher said,"Your son has displayed superior thinking skills but the lack of turned in assignments astounds us." My parents replied by saying,"Our son gets back everyday from writing club extremely tired and does not have the time or energy to do his homework." they came to a conclusion to cancel writing club for me and then I started turning in my homework on time. 44 percent of homework is not completed due to lack of time. If you say that they can do their homework when they get home after the extracurricular activity I would say that kids are not fully developed adults yet and dont have as much energy or stamina and cannot function after long periods of time.\n\nThe second reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be abolished is,that schools do not specialize in what club or sport that they offer and they will not teach it as well as the facilities that specialize in what they are offering. Its not the schools job to provide extra clubs they can offer clubs but they should not be able to force you to join a club. If a child wants to play a sport or endorse an activity, he can go to an outdoor club or facility that specializes in what the child wants to do. When i was eleven years old,I played on my school soccer team. The coach did not know how to play soccer and I hated it. I never got any better and I almost quit soccer then and there,but I went home one night and told my mom about it. She said,"You should try UCLA Soccer I read about it it\'s very interesting". I tried it out the very following week it was amazing,I loved it and,I have been playing soccer ever since. If you say that the school clubs can also be good at teaching what they do I would tell you that a school club will never be as good at teaching a sport or activity than an actual facility that specializes at the given sport or activity.\n\nThe third and final reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activities must be abolished is,that if you force the kids to choose from a limited set of sports and clubs they might not like any of the activities that you are offering and because of that they will never practice what they are being taught and will never get better at what they are being taught. If a person does not like what they are being taught 98 percent of the people will not practice the subject or sport they do not like. If you dont practice what you are being taught you will never get better at what you are practicing and will never succeed at it. My cousin used to play karate and he hated it he would always pass the tests but he would never practice and as a black belt some of the blue belts that practiced were stronger than him. One day his mom asked him"Why arent you as good as some of the other students"? He replied by saying,"I dont enjoy karate like I used to and as a result,I don\'t practice anymore".\n\nIf you say that people at school can like the subject or sport they are being taught I would say that is the reason extracurricular activities should be offered but not forced.\n\nGeneric_Name smiles at the teacher as she comes by "Do you have your homework she asks"?"Yes ma am."he replies with a grin. Ever since the rule that made extracurricular activities mandatory got abolished he has had time to finish all of his assignments and still had a little time for relaxation. I disagree with the principal\'s rule that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity because students can use the time for more beneficial purposes,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.',

      "Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so why not satiate all three by participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wide joy by solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!\n\nFirstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved by participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached by all participants makes the friend-finding process much more simple. Exracurriculars also provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel they don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel they do. Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability by building support systems has never been more important.\n\nNext, parents may find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school may not have to do that anymore, at least for a day or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new found friends to get home.\n\nFinally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!\n\nIn SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.\n\nExtracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires joy in people is always a good option. Starting with extracurricular activities is a great option!",

In my opinion, participating in one extracurricular activity is termenously and entertainment for students.\n\nFrist, participating in one extracurriclar activity can help students on their others subjects or doing their other school work. For example, if students particpates in more than one activity they can not focus on their other subject like math, doing thier homeworks and studing for thier tests. In addtion for students to focus or particpate on thier other subject is better for them to participate in one activity.\n\nNext, particpateing in one activity have a great impact on students.

All activity are not easy some are diffcult and some of them are easy but we have to try our best.\n\nFurthermore, students should particpate in one extracurriclar activity because they can complete their work on time.

      "Participating in an after school activity is important, but should not be required. Not everybody would want to be forced to do a extracurricular activity because a lot of the people who don't, exercise on their own. Even though activities are healthy physically and mental, they should not be forced upon students or anybody, it should be their choice of how their future will be, no one should choose for them. Even doing something to help out the school would be a bad idea because that would extend a lot of the students school hours. Some students like to do homework at their home, not at school. Others have pets that they need to take care of and if their parents sent them to the vet for the day, that would cost a lot of money for them. Others could have had a horrible day and would want to go home immediately, but they would be forced too stay and that would make them feel much worse. Because students are stressed through out most of the day, staying after school for at least an hour a day would be bad for their brains. Yes I agree that after school activities is a good idea, but forcing it would take the fun out of it. Students should be able to choose what they do in their lives, not having it already chosen. Causing more stress for a student could be bad for their future, stress leads to headaches which leads to migraines, which is bad for the brain. An unhealthy brain would affect the students overall grade in school. If a student is stressed out, it will be harder for them to sleep the following night due to their brains being worn out. Students in middle school already get very little sleep from the early school hours, they will get less sleep from stress from school. If their bodies to not already produce a certain amount of meletonin, (The substance the brain produces to cause sleep) it will be much harder for them to sleep. Sleep for students and adults is very important because it effects their everyday lives. More students staying after school will also cause the teachers to have more stress from the students complaining that they are being help hostage or something in a joking way. The teachers would get annoyed from that very quickly, which would cause stress in the future for them too.\n\nFor example, if a student was the head of the student council, that means that he could have to do extra work at home instead of getting free time which helps calm the brain down. If he/she had ADHD such as myself, they might not know how to handle it as well as others with the same condition, it could make them very upset and they would not do the work, but they would be stressed because they would need to turn it in. If a kid did sports and got injured while playing or in their free time, it would affect their ability to play the sport and affect their performance in Physical Education of which would affect their grade. Somebody who does not play a sport but exercises in their free time would be forced to play a sport or stay after school and do an activity would most likely be unhappy due to the loss of their free time. I am not saying that students should not play a sport or stay after school, because they should be able to exercise in their own time and stay after school for an activity that they have chosen. Exercise is important for everybody, but it should not be forced, they will be the ones to live with their own consequences. If that where to happen. Students would fall asleep in class from being to tired to stay awake. Students would need multiple breaks through out the school day to keep them engaged knowing that they will have to stay after school. Others will be exited because that means that they will get to play sports more often because they find sports enjoyable, as others do not. If the students who play sports are passionate about sports and they lose their game, they would become upset which would cause stress because they would practice more often thinking that they will never win which could cause a breakdown from not achieving their goal under a lot of unneeded stress. If they win a game, then play against the same team again, they would think that they would easily win again, but lose due to being cocky. which would lead the the breakdown, then the other team would be cocky and so on and so forth. If at school the losing team could get mad at each other for not doing as well and could cause a fight between them, the fight would then affect their next game because they would be trying to out do each other.\n\nStudents who get in fights usually make up to each other, but not always. If they where best friends, there is a possibility that it would end up like a hockey fight without the sticks. Fights would probably suspend both of them, that would definitely effect their overall grade. The loss of a close friend or any friend at all would make them upset, which would then cause them to lose sleep the next few nights. When they are grown up, assuming they still have the record of the fight, it would be harder for both of them to get a job due to possible fights.\n\nMost ideas on paper sound perfect if you don't think about it that much or don't think about it at all. But if you really go into detail and think of all of the possible outcomes, it becomes so much easier to find all of the flaws and becomes easier to fix them. To make a big change for students lives, you have to take the time and not rush to get it done, you have to think about preexisting conditions of some students. Consulting with the parents would also be helpful so you can see their point of view, take a vote and ease the students into a new change, not in the time span of a week or month, students would have to adapt to the change live an organism evolving to match its needs as the world changes. Because if the environment changes too quickly, the organism will die, and the death for us all is stress. Every possible outcome has to be considered for a big change, nothing should be instant.",

      "Middle school is supposed to have more freedom to pick and choose for classes,and clubs. If the principal says we must pick an extracurricular activity, it would take away the sense of freedom to choose. So i'm going to voice my opinion that it's our choice,also it makes the principal look bad,and that it takes away our own time.\n\nWe came to this school because its gives us more freedom to choose than elementary school. Now the choice seem more like a duty and make this experience less interesting. If I had to pick a extracurricular activity it feel like a normal class not a fun hobby or an interest. Then when i get a job using the skill from an extracurricular activity I most likely hate my job.\n\nIt also not so good towards the principal. It would make me feel forced and oppressed to do this activity. I'd feel obliged or it feel like a chore more than fun and intriguing. The principal look like a tyrannical ruler to the students.\n\nAlso it called\n\nEXTRA\n\ncurricular activities. Infecense on extra which means not reqiured or more time. It should be our own time to use however we want and not to be consumed by these\n\nEXTRA\n\ncurricular activitys. If I have practive of the same day as the\n\nEXTRA\n\ncurricular activity and it cuts into my practice time do stay so my grade not effected or do I go and work on my dream/goals\n\nSo im hoping after this you will let us choose and make our own decisions.\n\nthank you for reading :)",

      "Our principle has decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity. Students can serve as student council, work on the yearbook, or even play a sport. I think this is a good idea or way for kids to express themselves. Here are some reasons why I agree with being apart of the activities.\n\nOne thing you can do is work on the yearbook. You can also open up and help motivate others. Participating in something helps with many skills such as, communication and working with others. The yearbook could even have anonymous writers, if you want to say something and don't want everyone knowing who said it. Also taking photos of other activities around the school would even be great.\n\nAnother extracurricular activity you could do is serving as student council. If you want to see changes in somethings you can step up and work as a council to make a difference. You could also get groups to hang up motivational quotes around the school. Sometimes, even having funds to raise money for the school would be a helpful idea.\n\nYou can also play sports to participate in an activity. Playing sports gives you the time for you make new friends, do what you love, and even hang with your bestie. Finding a sport you like can be hard but giving it your all is the best you can do. You can even get scholarships to colleges. And being on a team is your best suport group, they are always there when you need them.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree we should be in extracurricular activities. It gives us the opportunity to express our self and have fun doing it. They can also help try and change things to make a difference. The activities also have benefits for us and for school. All of these are reasons why we should participate in extracurricular activities.       ",

      "Being a teenager can be one of the best times of your life. As a teenager, I myself have participated in many sports activities and extracurricular activities in my free time. Although I am lucky enough to have experienced being in a club and on a sports team, other students may not have that opportunity.\n\nI believe that schools should require extracurricular activities, one of the reasons being kids social skills. Being put into different clubs or sports teams can help teens make new friends and provide a larger circle of students they can interact with on a daily basis. Being in those activities can provide new experiences those kids never thought to try. This can spark new interests and lead to students doing bigger and better things in their lives, and also help them with choosing a career path.\n\nThis generation of teenagers has become addicted to technology and social media. Kids ranging from high school all the way down to preschool use technology on a daily basis. If schools require students to participate in an extracurricular activity, It will pull students away from social media and lead to a more productive way in them spending their time. Too much screen time can take a toll on young people's mental health and I believe that in having required activities, kids of all ages can focus on sports rather than their social media status.\n\nIf school were to make extracurricular activities required, they would probably have to provide them for free. Schools can't force the parents to pay for extra activities, nor can some parents afford to pay for those activities. If the school covered the cost of everything the school would get more respect, because it would be showing they didn't just care about grades and they care about your mental health as well. If extracurricular were required it would be good for the school to get to fill up their clubs. For example, they could have more students in the yearbook club, which would improve the quality of the work they put into the yearbook.\n\nIn the end I believe that having required extracurricular activities would really make the school environment a happy and healthier place for students, teachers, and parents. ",

      'Students should at least do one type of extracurricular activity because it will help them learn new things about their selfs, entertain them, and make new friends.\n\nDoing an extracurricular activity can help the students learn new things about their self. For an example I have always thought basketball was a boring and pointless sport but when I saw others playing in this sport I ended up giving it a chance and started playing this sport. I eventually started to like this sport but it took some time getting use to, now it\'s the only thing I can think about all day. If the students learn new things about their self they will become more comfortable with themselves and whenever someone asks a question about what they like or whats their favorite sport they dont have to go "Uhm, I am not really sure I dont know what I really like".\n\nAnother reason students should do an acitivity is because they need to be entertained. Most students get really bored and have nothing to do in their extra time and when students have extra time they just sit around and complain how that there is nothing to do but if a student does a extracurricular activity they will engage in much more activites and not be as bored than before.\n\nAnother good reason for students to do an extracurricular activity is so they can make new friends, some students find it hard to make friends and find it hard to social with others; but if the students join a activity they will get use to being with others and be social more with others and the students will be out of their shell and will be their selfs around others.',

      "Our principal has decided that every student must be at least one extracurricular activity. In my opinion ,I strongly disagree with the principals decision and I think students should have the option and freedom to choose whether they want to participate in school activities or not. So today I'm here to explain why this is a bad idea and hope you will agee with me as well.\n\nFirst of all,most students after school are busy, at least I know I am. When I'm done with school and go home I immediately get ready to go to the gym with my mom, I go to the gym at least 2 hours ,after that I go do my homework ,then prepare for my piano lessons at the community center ,and now adding an activity I'm forced to do my schedule gets pretty tight . Thats also a main reason why students dont go to school activities, they simply don't have enough time. But after the principals decision , students have to re-organize their schedules making them have less time to do the things they really want to do.\n\nSecondly , what if students don't like the activity they are forced to do. Yes, I know they are plenty of choices to choose from , but theres a chance students won't like any of them. It will make them feel pressured, stressful, and not joyful about going there. The student may also rebel , leading to them acting bad around the students and making the activity simply unpleasant.\n\nLastly , this school activities makes it feel like an extra hour of school. We already have enough homework and stress coming at us, so why should we get more? I get that the school is trying to make us be productive and help our school in a fun way with our friends , but whats the fun if we are getting forced to do them, also when students are getting forced to do an school activity it makes students feel like they have to do an extra class that doesn't even help our grades , nor does it count as a grade.\n\nIn conclusion, this are some of the reasons I disagree with the principals decisions. I hope this could change your and the principals mind and take in considerate on students opinions as well.\n\nStudents should choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and not be forced to.

      "Seven hours per day for five days a week and some students have activities to do after school, along with that students have mountain high piles of homework nightly. Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.\n\nSeven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule. Other students may be struggling with an aspect of school and they go to tutoring for that reason. Adding an extracurricular could interfere with the help they need to succeed.\n\nStarting from age seven students are asked to do homework. When students are seven and in 1st grade they may not have a large amount of homework; however, when students are in high school the quantity will only grow. While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.\n\nPlenty of studies have shown that this past generation of students have the the largest amount of stress scientist have seen in years. Whether that stress comes from bullying, home life, school work, mental health, or high expectations, stress is unsettling high in students of all ages. Middle school student worry about the transition to high school, and high school students worry about their transition to college. All students worry, even if those worries are irrational, they are still stressed. That is why adding an extracurricular could be too much to ask of students.\n\nOverall, extracurricular activities being mandatory sounds wonderful and has many pros as well, but when people look closer they realize that it would end up as a train wreck. Extracurricular activities should stay optional for those students who have the time and the energy to do their absolute best.",

      "How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all of the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.\n\nIn the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an extremely big interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyways, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.\n\nWith the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many different opportunities that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremely helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievement for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside of the school as well.\n\nIn the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all of the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activities that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activitites may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",

At the age when your going into high school, you need to be focused in school and focused on your grades and choose a good extracurricular activity so you know what your going to be experiencing when you choose a job that you think will be good for you, and will enjoy. But if a student dosen't choose a extracurricular activity then they won't know what they'll do when they grow up and get older. they probably wont have a good job because they didnt choose a extracurricular activity when they should have in high school.

It allows students to stay occupied or active, It gives students the ability to socialize with friends in and out of school, it could introduce a student to an activity that they have no idea they like until they try it, or it might even give them an idea on what they might want to do for a job as an adult. I think that allowing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, can help a student grow as a person.\n\nI think participating in activities after school is a great idea for all students. I believe that extracurricular activities keeps students occupied or active. For example, sports offer students not only a source of exercise, but it also gives them a form of entertainment and a chance to meet new people with your same interests or have fun with the people you already know. After school activities don't only have to be sports though, there's a variety of options, like music, strategy activities, or art. These allow you to either do more of what you love, or maybe find something new. Also, it could allow them to make new friendships with others. By participating in something like this, can give the student an idea on what they might want to do for a living as an adult. As a student you might not know what to do for a living, but extracurricular activities can allow a student to find a hobby and give them a gist of what they might want to study later on. Finally, these after school activities allow students to practice skills that will help them throughout their life, like strategy, athleticism, and socialization.\n\nOverall, I think that having a rule that makes all students participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea because it keeps students active and participating in something, it allows you to socialize with ones you don't know and ones you do, it also gives you more options for a hobby, maybe you could find something that you are interested in to study later in life, it can give you a chance to find something new that you didn't know you liked before, and finally, it practices important skills that will help you throughout your entire life.

Because sometimes our school needs a little pick me up I think in some spots it could use a little makeover and that's okay.

Some schools have put tons of money into sports like buying new equipment etc. So why not continue on of what people in the past have put money into. Joining sports can be a big deal but no matter what just think about how much you are helping out.\n\nAnother thing you could do is help out with yearbooks. Sometimes it can be really stressful for teachers, so why not lend another helping hand and see where it takes you. I mean you never know, they may really like the way you helped out and may ask you to do other things! You never know what the future holds. Not only can you help out with yearbooks, you could also help out by redecorating some things in your school. Just throw your opinion right in there! It could also turn into something you really enjoy and you could continue on with that. Then all you have left to do is say thank you to your principal.\n\nIf you enjoy painting or building and you want to help out, let someone know and your school can definitely help find something you can do to help. One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking.\n\nIn so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be. This is why i love doing extracurricular activities! Show what you can do and do it. I believe in you!",

      "I disagree with the decision that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.\n\nHere are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.\n\nHowever there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricular activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.\n\nI think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.\n\nIn conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine, one day you're at school, and you hear over the loudspeaker that all students in the building must report immediately to the Lecture Hall, for some new \"adjustments\". Although you are a bit surprised by this sudden announcement, you walk towards the Lecture Hall at a leisurely pace (as if you were anticipating something like this to happen). Once you're there, you sit in a chair and wait for all the other students to come rushing in like a stampede of wildebeests. After everything settles down, the principal picks up a mic from a lectern on the stage and starts a speech. In this speech, he talks about how the after school clubs are experiencing a steep decline in the number of students that attend them. He presents the crowd with a solution to this problem, a solution that is greeted with some harsh criticism from the majority of the student body. He says that, in order to keep the after school program alive, all students will be forced to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and that all students who chose to not follow this new rule will be expelled. Bewildered by this, you yell out in protest of this new policy, but to no avail. For the principal has already left the stage, and now you have to be a part of one of those worthless, unnecessary, and boring after school clubs. As you can see, it is detrimental, to both the students and the school as a whole, to force all of the students in a school into participation in an after school activity. Due to a plethora of factors along with the one I just described, I wholeheartedly disagree with my principal on forcing every student in the school to attend an after school club. If you don't believe me already(in regards with this issue at my school), then hopefully the following paragraphs will succeed in persuading you.\n\nFirst of all, making it mandatory for all students in a school to attend at least one club takes away some of their freedom with how they experience their lives. By this, I mean that, by forcing students to go to an after school club, you are limiting their options for what they can do after school is over. This is due to the simple fact that, once the student chooses their club(s), the time that that club occupies can't really be used for anything else and takes up a big chunk of the student's schedule. To give context, allow me to give you an example. Lets say that Generic_Name, a seventh grader, decided to take\n\nQuiz Bowl as his extracurricular activity. Immediately all regular activities from 2:30- 5:30 are canceled. In addition to this, he now has to go to some weekend meetings, resulting in him not have time to hang out with his friends anymore, study for school, do all of his homework, or go to the gym. Instead, he now has to guess answers to random questions about the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and wait till about 6:00 PM to get picked up by his bus, and then dropped off at home at almost 7:00 PM, completely exhausted and burned out. As, you can hopefully see, having to do even just one after school activity can take a lot time out of a students life, and in extension a lot of freedom with their life.\n\nSecond of all, with this new policy, transportation can become an incredibly detrimental issue for students that suddenly have to take at least one extracurricular activity. This is because there will always be some students in a school who can't take the bus and have parents that work too far away to be able to pick them up, making it nearly impossible for those students to get home safely, or on time. In addition to this, transportation can be a huge issue in the fact that, with\n\nALL\n\nstudents having to take an after school activity, on any given day, buses could have to leave behind some students because of a shortage of seats, leaving those who were left behind with no options to get back home. For example, let's say that all the students decide to participate in an extracurricular activity on the same day. With all of those students, it would be near impossible for them all to get a bus ride home. And because of all the parents that have to work during the time that those students would get picked up, the school would be left with a large crowd of students that have no way of getting home on time.\n\nFinally, this policy will probably create a harmful school environment. By this, I mean that it would result in a multitude of considerably hard-to-deal-with problems. Such problems would be: an unmotivated student body, protesting from parents, and an unproductive student body. The lower school morale may stem from anger in students at the principal, and teachers that are exhausted from being overworked due to the fact that most of them will have to host at least one after school club; the parents might complain due to the fact that they won't be able to interact with their children as much, and because they might not like the discontent in their children; and unproductivity would be caused by students burning out from the extra time that they have to spend in school. In addition to all of these problems, students might also try to not participate in extracurricular activities resulting in extreme punishments(i. e expulsion).\n\nTo wrap it all up, there are a lot of reasons as to why my principal's new policy on extracurricular activities isn't very great. It limits a students freedom, it can't really function due to the lack of transportation that is needed for all of the students, and it creates a bad school environment. For these reasons, I think that the principal shouldn't have made this policy.",

      "Dear Principle\n\nEvery student have to participate in a after school activity. i don't agree with this decision. Because everyone does not have the money or the time and grades for that. Also it would be harder on coaches if a lot of people try out for the team because he is cutting a lot of people from the team. Then parents are going to be mad because there son or daughter is going to get a bad grades just because they didn't do a after school activity. i disagree because people dont have time or money or don't have the grades foe the activity.\n\nPeople barely get free lunch how are they going to pay for trips and a hotel rooms if they have to go places for that after school activity. Also how are they going to find time to do homework. kids need free time to so they can live there lives will they still got it. Also there might not be a sport or activity the kids like cause the club or the sport might go till the school year is over and don't want to be stuck doing something you don't like. Also that's disrespect full if you force someone to do a after school activity.\n\nParents might not like having to pick there kid up everyday after school. Parents also might not like there kids being stressed over school work. Kids all ready have to stay at school for 7hours a day if they stay after its like 9 hours a day. Also as you get older you get tired easier so them 8th grade kids are going the go to sleep when they get home and forget about there homework and they might not even eat. I think parents would like to see there kids at the dinner tables and not sleep all day.\n\nNow let me tell you how this all adds up. First you have to find a activity then you get cut from sports and you cant find the right club. Then you finally find a club but turns out you dont like the club and you have to do it all year. Then you come home all stressed out because you dont like the club and have a lot of work to do and you tired. So then you get to sleepy so you take a nap but you sleep to long now you didnt finish the homework that you were going to turn in the next day. Now you have a bad grade and your mom is on your case about your work now your even more stressed. Then you quit the club because you so stressed out.

      "I agree because kids should be more physical and should get more excuise in, and the main reason i argee for the principal to make all the kids participate is because so they have some else to do in school other than work and sitting down all day . I think it will help kids get the understanding about sport and working on something, when they get older so what they meant to do and help people. my decision is that the principal should do that more because it will help kids be more better at thing like that so if they ever wanna play sport or anything they know that you have to participate in everything we do.\n\nActivity are fun thing thing to do with people and at school cause it enoyable and fun to do, i really think the principal should do that at every school and the principal is right all kids can participate in sport or work is because it keep kids busy and it have kids doing some extra instead of all the kids sitting in the house or just doing nothing and i think it the right think to do is becuase they can get to express more thing in the world and kids can see more other just not doing nun but being in the house sleep and it will make kids understand life more. I hope that csn get kids in a better place when they grow up and they wanna do stuff on there wn wy amd i think it be nick to do some with them kids as a young as to do do physical sport or work somewhere but it be better to start young and contiune when they get older and stuff,\n\nBut the principal is help alot of kids to do think they wanna start trying to do when they get older and I feel like yes that be an great thing to do at a certain age and kids get be participateing in alot of stuff now days . I think it get better and better if kids do it and get use to it because alot of kids are not gonna wanna do nothig because they just wanna stay in the house and get on there phone and not gonna wanna do anything is it would be alot nicer if the principal help out the parent and tell the kids they can aleast particpate in a physical sort or work or do anything they would like to do but they gonna have to participate in somethin but not nothing and i think it be good. I would like to see kids do better in life and do better than what there parent was doing at a young age it would be a thing and something they could do and they can get there own car house and all that and if tha kids like that they prolly can go to college and go to school for that activity and prolly can be a teacher or a manger for whatever they like when they was doing as kids. And it kinda help me out cause it like i like to do physicla thing and like to help people work or anything they need help doing and it like i would like to do it and i seem like an awesome thing to do. And i feel like more thing should enter this world so kids can eneter more thing to do and get into more thing as like an 'Jobs , daycares , and help the community out i think that would be a great think to do the most impoortan thing is how i feel about it or what my decision is about the principal had decided for th kids to participate in school or outdoor activity i think yes the principal should because the kids will prolly learn more from it then just do anything and like in a school activity they could be in a yearbook club , track team ,cheerleader , or any type of sport they are happy or anything to do.\n\ngirl or boys can do anything wanna do any sport or more and i think they should wanna do sport cause it got stuff they like and like to do and it keep alot of kids busy to do and i would like to do that to cause i like to work and do sport so for me for myself i would be helpful thing to do . Like everyday kids should do some to help them be better it can be anything i could be running , walking help you family do stuff for the house go shopping do some other than sport and wanna play all day like the game or wanna fight and bully people i think it time just to help the community out and treat everybody as a family because it not alot of people and now days people wanna play sprt get a good and nice job and wanna do alot and i would like to do tracka and be a dancer cause that what i wanna do and my job i would like to do is be a lawyer and something that can help school and everything else , and if the principal would do that i would be a smart great thing to do in that school cause it teaching kids a lesson to do better in life and help kids out , that be a great idea to do . and if i was the princpal i would do the same thing to .",

      "Imagine you're sitting at home, watching a show, and your mom says \"Go outside, and play with your friends.\" The problem for you is that you don't know a lot of kids out of school, so you have nothing to do but stay inside. That is just one of the consequences of not participating in after school activities. You don't know what you've been missing out on, so you don't think it's that big of a deal when you pass a poster in the hall, advertising a new club. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can interact with others, they will be off their phone screen, and it will look good on their applications.\n\nStudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's a good way to interact with others. Making friends can be really hard for some people while for others it can be the easiest thing to do. Joining a club can help with making a friend because the people in the club have the same interests as you. Once you've made a couple friends, you can develop your social skills like leadership, and confidence. If you join an after school program, you'll be able to make friends and have stronger social skills when talking to others.\n\nStudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will be off your phone screen. Yes, we all like binge watching our favorite shows, but it has to come to an end at some point in the day for us to be able to do our work and hang out with friends. When you stay after school you're not on your phone, scrolling down social media to see what your friends are doing. You are with your friends and talking to them. You may not notice it, but over time, your vision will get worse from staying on your phone for too long. So, when you stay after school, and your phone is packed away in your backpack, that helps your health. If join an after school club you will be more aware to your surroundings, and not stuck to your phone.\n\nStudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will look good on their applications. When universities look at your grades, they also look to see if you participated in other activities. For example, if you joined a club that had to do with public speaking, universities would think that you're able to present in front of a class, and jobs would think that you would do well in customer service. All these small things help you in your future. When you join an after school club, you will be able to have a lot of activities on your applications.\n\nStaying after school for clubs and activities will help you now, and in the future. It's getting you prepared for the life after school ends. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can interact with others, they will be off their phone screen, and it will look good on their applications. So, the next time your mom says \"Go outside and play with your friends.\" You don't have to worry about who to call and hang out with because you've made friends at school.",

      "Can a activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.\n\nIf more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just have a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.\n\nDoing any activity outside school also work makes people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind their goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discover and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outside the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physically and it makes he or she have a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence it's family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influence other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the you or them have changed so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.\n\nLike always everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most common problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.  ",

      "It's the last play of the State Championship you have the ball at midfield your going as fast as you can go but you know your not fast enough to out maneuver the defender insight but, you sidestep and the defender goes flying past and you walk into the end zone untouched to win the game. You look up into the stands and you see your entire town chanting your name then, you look back down to the sideline and you see your team, your brothers coming towards you and they lift you up on their shoulders and in that moment you feel like your the king of the world. This is what goes through your head as you hear your principal inform the whole school that everyone has to participate in a extracurricular activity. I agree that everyone should have to participate in a activity because there are so many good things that can come from them. Here are some reasons I suggest that it is vital for someone to participate in a extracurricular activity.\n\nLeadership is one of the most used traits people use it is vary important in your everyday life and in general it's a good character trait to have. First things first you need leadership skills in school let's say your put into a group with some people for a group project. Subsequently, no one is motivated to do any work so you take the reins and you jump right in and you start assigning people objectives to meet. With your leadership skills your group gets an A+ for the project all because you took charge. Another reason leadership is important is in sports if you play a position like me goalie, you always have to be controlling the defense or say your the quarterback of the football team you have to be able to communicate with the team and tell them the plays and control the offense. Most important of them all is when your an adult and you have to mange a small group of workers, you assign a worker project to complete by next week. That worker doesn't turn the project in on time and your boss gets mad at you because you were supposed to be managing it and making sure it is done on time.\n\nHaving friends in Middle School and High School are important for every kid, teen, and even adults. New kids struggle every day trying to make friends with others and people have already been friends for 3 year now. A great way for people to make friends with people is through extracurricular activities. Because, the new person and the people in the club or sport share the same interests they have a way to talk to each other. When I first moved to Generic_School I had no clue who any of these people were but, when football season came around and I signed up my team became my second family I knew them like brothers and we stayed together for years.\n\nSome parents won't be happy with the change to their kids schedule but, that is expected when you are making kids do stuff that is new to them. But, when you look at major cities like New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan extracurricular actives are changing their cities for the better. It's keeping the kids off the streets and they are less likely to have been roped into gang related activities. Even kids mortality rate has dropped rapidly since cities have implemented rules that make kids join sports teams or clubs. That shows that making kids do extracurricular activates has helped kids in bad areas stay safe and have a higher chance of making something of their lives.\n\nIn this passage I have presented you with some reasons I agree that is vital for schools to implement the rule that all students have to participate in extracurricular activities. This rule will forever change schools in the up and coming years for the better. I suggest that all schools should have this rule implemented for safety and to help their kids build social skills, leadership skills for them to use in their futures. This rule would show kids competitive environments because that's what it is like in the real world.          ",

    ESSAY:
      "Extracurricular activities, which are activities you can participate in and enjoy the things you would want to do after school such as sports, writing, and any after school activities your school can offer for the students. You're able to choose when and which after school activities you want to go too, but should every student be obligated to participate in extracurricular activities. Why students shouldn't be obligated to take part of an extracurricular activity. After school activities are something you should enjoy and not something to be forced to do and here's why. Some students might have a lot of stuff going on while they aren't at school. Students might also not like participating in after school activities due to no interest in the activities. Possibly students could see extracurricular activities as more stressful than fun.\n\nA students' time after school could be very valuable and partaking in after school activities could always be very time consuming. Sure after school activities could be an hour or two but what if a student has other important things to do out of school. A student could be participating into other activities like sports and might not have time to do homework or study and on top of that being obligated to stay after school. A student might also have pets or siblings to take care of, which would be more important than an after school activity. An obligated extracurricular activity would just be time consuming and might not fit into a students' schedule. The school should understand that students also need time at home because seven hours of learning in school is as already as hard as it is, and then having to go to an after school activity would just make the situation even worse.\n\nThere could also be no after school activities a student might have interest in. Some students might have interests that the after school activities doesn't offer them. Even if it's just working on the school year book, an after school activity must be something a student should enjoy after school, not just being forced to do extra work. Just like anything you would want to do, you would participate and join it because you wanted to, and not because of obligation or force too. Just forcing a student to stay after school for something they don't want to do would just make the student dislike school even more. Students should enjoy doing what they want after school which might not even be an extracurricular activity.\n\nStress would also partake in students having to be obligated to stay after school for extracurricular activities. After a long day at school students would just want to head home and relax from school. Worrying about having to stay after would just cause the student to be more stressed. What if a student didn't have a ride to get back home from after school activities or they were scared of being at school longer, then what would they do in that situation? In case these situations happen what should the solution be? Well since these issues could happen from obligation of partaking in an extracurricular activity, then the only solution should be that after school activities should not be obligated and only stay optional for the better.\n\nWhy students shouldn't be forced to participate after school activities. There are many reasons why a student shouldn't be obligated to participate in after school activities and why it should stay optional. Staying after school could stress a student out due to obligation of staying at school for an hour or two more. A student can have other things they do outside of school that after school activities can take time away from it. A student might even dislike the activities at the school and would not enjoy their time of staying after school which is the opposite of what after school activities are about. Staying after school is something that's optional and something you can enjoy doing. All concluded which is the reason why school activities shouldn't be a must.",

    ESSAY:
      'A few weeks ago, a priest said to me, "Go the second mile." That sentence really hit me. I asked myself if I was giving back to the world as much as the world gave me. I\'m sure you know that going the second mile means don\'t do the minimum, go above and beyond. I thought adding this short story would be important because sometimes kids just wanna do the minimum of going to school and then going home. I think that every kid should do at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you succeed with your academic life, do exercise, and have fun.\n\nFirst, I think that extracurricular activities can help you succeed with your academic life. For example, you can go to a math club if that is what you need help with. This demonstrates that doing extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject. For instance, you can get help from your teacher or coach on a subject that they might know more than you about. This shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to get more help on subjects you might need extra help with. Also, going to an extra class or activity can help you minimize your laziness by having not just to go there, but to complete the work you are given there too. My examples are all evidence of why extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject.\n\nSecond, extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise. For example, you can join a basketball team or soccer team. Joining any sports team would help you do exercise by playing with your teammates and practicing. For instance, you can join a math club, memory club, or any other type of academic club that can help you think and answer questions. This demonstrates that joining and academic club can help you exercise your brain by thinking and answering questions. Another way extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise is by doing community service for your teachers. Doing community service like cleaning tables or organizing the library is a way to do exercise because you are constantly moving your arms and legs. In this paragraph I showed you how extracurricular activities can help you work your muscles and exercise your brain.\n\nFinally, extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun. For example, you can hang out with your friends. Hanging out with your friends and doing an activity together can not only strengthen your friendship but also can be an excellent way to have fun. For instance, going to a basketball club or a club you really like can be an amazing way to have fun. This is because you get to do an activity that you love not just by your self, but with other people that love it too. Another piece of evidence that shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun is by meeting new people and making friends. Meeting new people and making friends is always fun if you let it be, so it demonstrates that extracurricular activities are a really good way to have fun. Every piece of evidence I wrote here are excellent examples of why extracurricular activities can bring you joy and happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you do better on a subject, help you work your muscles and brain, and bring you joy and happiness. Go try an extracurricular activity with your friends. In case you don\'t like the activities in your school, ask to make a new one. They are always worth the trouble. A very wise religious leader once told me, "Go the second mile." I found those words to be the greatest I have ever been told.',

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.\n\nAs we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This may also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.\n\nOur parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whether it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lot of money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.\n\nWhen it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.\n\nExtracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and can take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.",

      "Extracurricular Activities are like music; some people like it, others do not. The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree, for the students may be shy, busy, or have money problems at home.\n\nTo begin with, students could be shy. Being shy and put on the spot in front of a group could build anxiety or stress. If they work better alone, being apart of any extracurricular activity means that you work with other kids.\n\nThe students may not be athletic, or may not like the clubs the school offers.\n\nFor instance, if a student is shy and he or she has to work with a group and express ideas, or if they join a team and have to do certain tricks, their anxiety and stress may increase.\n\nAlso, children can be busy, they have a life outside of school just like everyone else.\n\nThey might have to take care of others.\n\nWhen taking care of others its hard to go to a club or sport after school, because when you get home your tired from your long day .\n\nThat is not fare to the students because when they get home they will be tired, have to do homework, and take care of somebody.\n\nThe kids may have appointments, like doctors appointments dentist appointments, or therapy appointments.\n\nSome appointments can be every night, depending on the circumstances but no one should miss their appointment.\n\nFor example, a students has therapy appointments three times a week with his therapist he should not have to miss his appointments for any club or sport.\n\nIn addition, kids may have money problems. They might not have a car, or money to get transportation. They probably do not walk home because by the time for them to leave it would be dark and their parents do not want them to walk home.\n\nIf they join a club they might have to buy a shirt, or if they join a team they might not have money for uniforms.\n\nSpecifically, if a student does not have transportation at home, and does not have money for other transportation, then he would not be able to go.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not think that having an extracurricular activity is needed for all students. I think this unfair, granted that they can build social skills, and spend less time on electronic devices.\n\nIn my opinion they should not be forced to join a extracurricular activity. I think they should encourage it but not force it.",

      "Have you wanted a to hit a soccer ball and make a goal or win a debate tournament at your school. Students who want to try-out sports or debate find an extracurricular at their school. Having at least a extracurricular is a good idea to have when you are looking for something new at your school or club. Students who are engaged with the extracurricular are going to more focus on other topics. Extracurricular is a great way to keep students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends.\n\nHaving a extracurricular helps keep students active. Most students are on their phone all the time,so by having students participate in a extracurricular prevents them on their phone. I have done an extracurricular in my school, that has help forget about my phone and instead focus on more important on my softball team. Keeping students active on extracurricular helps them focus on the extracurricular they are doing. There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active.\n\nAn extracurricular has different options to tryout. Trying out a extracurricular can be hard to choose. When you are trying out extracurricular you should find talents or skills that you are good at to find the perfect extracurricular. When I had to find a extracurricular I to choose activities that I am good at, or extracurricular that is joy able. Extracurricular is fun to explore out what kind of activities you are good and most joy able.\n\nSocializing with your friends is fun when you can hang out with your friends in a extracurricular. Socializing with your friends can be extracurricular, for example like a girl or boy's club or a book club can be ways of an extracurricular. Another, way you can socialize with your friends is making new friends in extracurricular. You to meet other people that might want to be friends with. I have friends and made friends in a book club while talking about the book and relevant topics.\n\nHaving at least one extracurricular is a great to keep students active on the activity, finding different extracurricular's and socializing with your friends and making new ones. Keeping students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends are different ways of enjoying extracurricular and engaging students to themselves the activity that their are really interest into. So what I think about students participating in a extracurricular in school is that students should have an opportunity to have at least one extracurricular. ",

      "Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? Probably so, it'll be beneficial to them.\n\nI think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it'll give them a new experience, they'll meet new people, and depending on the activity, it can help them develop their future.\n\nAn after school activity can give you a new experience, but how? Sometimes, you might not know exactly what you like, so an extracurricular activity could help you learn more about yourself. I mean, even if you dont like it you'll know not to do it again, right? Besides learning more about yourself, trying something new can just be good for you, especially if what you're doing is a sport or something that'll develop your future. Well, maybe your friends might want to brag to others that they were on the football team when they graduate. A sport or even an art activity could help you if you're applying to a job, but it would also give you, in a way, work experience, especially if you're applying to a job that is related to that activity when you're older. Even if you might not like the activity, it will be beneficial to you at some point.\n\nMeeting new people can benefit students. Sometimes, you might not have many friends who have the same hobbies, but when you're joining an activity, especially if it's something that you like, there's bound to be people that have the same hobbies. Who knows, maybe you might find a really good friend there. Meeting new people can make connections, connections are good to have when you're older and you might have a specific job to do. Maybe you might just need something and you remember your friend from that activity became a pretty great manager of a popular company. Usually, when you're joining an extracurricular activity, there's going to be people who are older than you and they have more experience in the activity you might've joined, it would be helpful to you to learn what they have been taught. It's good to learn from other perspectives, don't you think? Making new friends and meeting new people could ease stress with coming up tests, they'll help you relax a little more.\n\nWell, what if students don't want to participate? It can be difficult for a student to participate if something is happening outside of their school life. Sometimes, students might not be able to participate because of family, work, money, or time. There's a point in time where they will have to make exceptions. Besides that, usually it seems like the students around here might not do much outside of school, so they'll be kept a little busy with an activity.\n\nMy final thought is that, of course, students should participate because they'll meet new friends, maybe even learn some new skills, and develop themselves and their future. So, go ahead and join an activity, you could really learn from it!",

      "Imagine going home and doing nothing but work, work, and more work. Being cooped up in the house and the only thing you could do is homework for hours. I think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. They will have the chance to do something that makes them happy. Something that will let their brain take a break from working so hard during school.\n\nStudents will be able to make new friends and meet new people. Before I came to middle school I only knew the people from my elementary school and that was it. Until I joined chorus, I made friends with people that enjoyed music as much as I did. It was so much fun to be around new people and to make new friends. Even though we would have to stay after school to practice for up coming concerts it was still worth it. It gave me something to do after school and I could let my brain take a break from comprehending all the learning tactics that I have come across in school. I got the opportunity to do the one thing that makes me happy almost everyday. If students participate in an extracurricular activity it will give them a chance to open up to new people that may stay with them for a long time in their life.\n\nStudents will have something fun to do after school. They would get to enjoy something fun that they may want to continue in their future. It gives them a chance to relax and enjoy the things they love to do outside of school. It will be a more enjoyable experience when they are doing something that really makes them happy. One of my friends loves to play sports and it makes her really happy. She was not worried about homework or getting something done right when she got home. Instead she got the chance to let her mind rest from all the learning and power on the part of her brain that helps her enjoy the sport that she loved. Students will have a better time concentrating on there homework after they have had time to relax by doing extracurricular activities.\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to learn something new whether it is a new instrument or a new sport. Every day in school you learn new things in all subjects but it is all surrounded around test and quizzes. But when a student decides to take an extracurricular activity they can learn something that will make them much happier and that does not involve test or quizzes. When I was in fourth grade I decided to start playing the violin. I understood that it was a big responsibility taking on something outside of school but it was worth it. I have always loved playing the violin and I continue to play it now. Also I had to stay after school multiple times to practice with everyone in the orchestra. I learned how to make my brain stronger by doing something that was at a different level of difficulty in a different way.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. Students might discover something new about themselves that they did not know before they decided to take and extracurricular activity. Students should not have to work so much and not have any time to themselves. Everyone needs time to relax and do the things they love. By relaxing they give their brain a break to recharge and get ready for all the work that will come in the future.",

      "Student's usual school day lasts about 6-8 hours. After school, students usually like to kick back and relax. Some student's might actually have things to do after-school, like sports or schoolwork. However, if they're principal takes that privilege away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.\n\nStudents also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.\n\nBeing required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work. Late assignments will increase, which will bring down student's grades very quickly. More missing work will increase, too, which will bring their grade down even more. Adding more after-school activities, whether it's academic or not, will cause students unnecessary stress.\n\nSo whats the issue? After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.",

      "Your Principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Do you agree? Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills, build life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. Yes, i think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nExtracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills. Many people have various forms of social anxiety or they may just be naturally shy, but bonding over something you both enjoy doing can build true friendships that can last a lifetime. For example, i'm a competitive dancer, and i remember when i first stared dancing, i was shy and didnt like to do anything that was out of my comfort zone. Now i've been dancing for almost 9 years and my favorite people are my friends at my dance studio. While i started off shy and scared to talk to new people, i have become best friends with the people i was shy around, i believe if everyone does a club or activity, everyone would have amazing friendships like mine.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to build social skills and a great way to build life skills too. soccer is a sport that builds control, endurance, and good sportsmanship, while a club like Beta club, is a club that builds leadership skills and gives you the opportunity to help those around you. There is something different with every activity, if you try and find a club or activity that helps to build the skills you are interested in or skills you would like build, then you might just end up having a good time and it might just be something you'll want to do as a profession.\n\nClubs and Activities are a great way to build social skills, build life skills,and also a great way to enhance your future. Clubs and activities will build skills you will use for the rest of your life. If you do a academic club, you might win first place in a really big category, that win will look really good on your college application. If you do a sport, college scouts might be at your game and they might recognize you and give you a free scholarship to a college and maybe that college will be one you really wanted to go to. Clubs and activities can benefit your future in so many more ways then you might think.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to build social and life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. when your principle asks you if your going to do an extracurricular activity, what will you say?",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine you are at your high school graduation, your name gets called up and every one in your grade chants your name. You have came far for this opportunity to go to a top notch university. You would think that it was all of your teachers that helped you. But then you forget about your Math and Science Olympiad coaches, your basketball coach. I believe that schools need extracurricular activities. If my principal told made a rule that every one single one of the kids had to do a extracurricular activity, I would most likely sign up in at least two or three activities. The reasons why I think this are, You can learn Important life skills, you gain knowledge of things you didn't know before academically, and it can sometimes be fun.\n\nMy first reason why you should have these activities were that you can learn a bunch of life skills that would very useful in the future. Like teamwork. Teamwork is a very important skill you need to learn. In the future when you get a job. You will need to work with your coworkers. Sometimes you know your coworker an other times you will get paired with someone you will not know. It is always very important to know how to work with other and communicate with them when necessary. My second example is that it teaches time management. When I was in Odessy of the Mind, I had little to know time to do my homework. So I would do my homework at school and not worry about it when I would get home. This is why so you can just chill in you home or do other priorities. Third and final example is Responsibility. Let's all be honest. We all learn responsibility when we were very young. I learned it before I started Preschool. I will give you an example on why responsibility is so important. You are playing football. You are the center. Your job is to snap the ball to the quarterback and block the big defensensive tackles and linebacker. If you don't do you are responsible for, then the quarterback will get tackled for a lose of yards, or he will get hurried to throw the ball and will throw a bad pass. This is why this skill is so important. You need to what your job is and how to do it.\n\nMy second reason why you should have these activities is that you gain knowledge academically. When you go to a extracurricular activity to do with math or science, you will learn new things from an academical standpoint. Take math for an example. Let's say you are in 6th grade. You are talking an after school math advanced math class. Your teacher teaches you the Quadratic Formula. Look at you now, you are in 6th grade and you know how to do quadratics. Also, take science for an example. They teach you a ton of things, maybe you are in 7th grade and talking an extracurricular class of physics. Great job, now you know what a black hole is. Okay, my last example is that you are in student council, now you know how to stand up and talk to people and know how rules get passed. I could list hundreds of examples. But you can only do this if you have a positive mindset and be there only if you want to be there.\n\nMy third and final reason is that you actually have a lot of fun. If you play a sport such as football and basketball, you get excited and have a ton of fun, Sometimes when in an extracurricular class, you have fun time learning new things that you are interested in learning. You can sometimes have a lot of fun and learn things academically to. You can reduce stress and anxiety, and it can exercise your brain. So from an entertainment standpoint. Extracurricular activities are really good.\n\nWell I believe that Extracurricular activities are very useful and great de to these three reasons, They teach you very important life skills, they teach you things from an academical standpoint, and the third and last reason was that they are really fun. Extracurricular activities are no classes that you have to get an A on. They are classes the you inquire knowledge out of. They are their to give you the knowledge that you need.",

      "\"well not all people like to do other things.\" Joining a different activity is not what a lot of people like to do very much. Kids dont really talking in front of a lot of people because they could be shy or anything. When kids do a extracurricular activity they could agree with people and disagree with people because everyone don't have the same opinion. So I disagree because some could get hurt doing sports , they go visit family and they don't have time to do anything and people is not an out door person and don't talk that much.\n\nKids could get hurt doing sports , like I was younger at my dad football practice and a boy pop his bond out of place so they call the ER and he had to get things done. Most kids hurt they self though out the year when they're doing sports because they could of been doing things wrong so they hurt themselves. Most people don't like going outside and doing that much activity or like playing sports. A lot of kids like to be healthy if they going to play a sports or anything and they keep their body in shape. Students shouldnt have have participate in a activity if they dont want to and i dont thing they should get force too if they dont want to do it at all.\n\nMost kids don't often go and visit they family so some kids go on trips and visit they family if they don't see them and things. It's good that kids go see they're family, also and kids are shy, they don't talk to people or they're not an outdoor person so they stay in the house and don't talk to no one. It would take up kids time if they want to go visit they family so I think kids should go visit they family if they don't see them that often and if they want to spend time with them. Most people worry about they family so they don't have time to go visit their family that much. Like my family that live far but not that far away from me i would go visit them and still be in things.\n\nEven tho kids are not an outdoor person or dont talk to that much people it they still dont have to do something they dont want to. Kids dont like staying after school for sports or anything only if its something fun and your helping out thats what kids like to do. Doing something could help but students shouldn't have to just do it if they dont want to and its theyre choice if they want to do it or not they dont have to get force to. A lot of kids just dont talk or nothing and they don't do nothing but talk to they friend or stay in the house and not do nothing. Most kids dont even have that much friends they could do or nothing so most kids dont do after school activitys.\n\nKids just don't go outside or don't do something because they could get hurt or anything. Most kids love doing an activity with their school and then other kids just dont like doing something at all. So I disagree because kids shouldnt have to do something they dont want to do if its in school or out of school. They also dont have to be/get force to do anything. A lot of other kids are like teachers pet and do a lot for teachers and even help out with a lot of teacher with a lot of things . Kids are shy to even do extracurricular activity like help with year books , do sports or anything, most kids dont even see their family like they'er opposite to so kids dont do other activity or sports like that.             ",

      "My principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with what my principal said about how we must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first benefit is students could be forced into something that they actually love. The second thing is students could be really good at something and just not know. And last is kids can get really lazy sometimes and making them do something can make their life a lot better.\n\nFirst, students could get forced into something they actually love. If a student decides to play a sport for their activity then they could end up really liking it. The students could end up playing that sport for the rest of their life. If they like that sport and keep playing then they could meet new friends. Overall, extracurricular activities can create great experiences.\n\nSecond, Students could be really good at something and just not know. Is someone has never played a sport Then they dont know how good they could be at it. I have a friend that had never played basketball And when he first tried the sport it turns out hes good. Any person that tries a new sport could end up playing with the pros, all you have to do is just try the sport. In the end, being forced to do something could reveal a talent.\n\nLastly, kids can get really lazy at times and by forcing them to do and extracurricular activity can change their life. For instance, if they have weight issues then you could sign them up for a sport so they can loose some of that weight. Also by making them do an activity it can change a persons view on a certain group of people and maybe make them want to do what those people do. By playing something as a kid can make that person as an adult have a stronger work ethic. In conclusion, doing extracurricular activities as a kid can help you as an adult.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities can help find and create good things for you in life. My first example is students could get forced into something that they actually like. Second, kids can be very talented at something and just not know it. And lastly, kids can get really lazy and by forcing them to do these activities can make them into a new person. By making students do extracurricular activities you can help a lot of kids.",

      "Do you agree or disagree that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity? Well i believe that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity because it creates bonds and builds teamwork skills.\n\nExtracurricular activities create bonds by forcing students to join with one another in a group project so they will make friends among the group. Students will be able to further improve their passion for the activity for example I found out about the D&D club at my school I went to one of their sessions and found out that I really had a passion for the game, I am still enjoying it to this day.\n\nExtracurricular activities build teamwork skills by making students work together to get a task done. For example when I was in D&D me and my group were in a forest when we saw a dead horse on the road two of my teammates were squinting to try and see the details, another one of my teammates was booking it to the horse to try to see what happened and I'm just standing their thinking to my self what are these nut jobs doing then suddenly the teammate who was booking it got jumped by goblins I forced a fire bolt at one of the goblins, one of my other teammates is playing ping pong with his short bow, another one puts a knife in a goblins back, the paladin smashes his hammer on one of them, and the wizard throws acid at one we took them all out but the one who booked it died the end.\n\nWhat should have been taken away from this is that being part of an extra curricular activity helps make bonds and encourage teamwork skills, do you agree or disagree that studets must be in a extracurricular activity.",

      "Your principal has decided all students need to participate In at lest one extracurricular activity this year do you agree or disagree with this decision?\n\nI disagree, because a lot of students have siblings to take care of, some of there families won't let them do sports as well as there parents may work to late to come get them after a game or practice.\n\nFist, a lot of students have to go home and take care of there brothers and sisters because their parents work to late so therefor how are you going to have time to play a sport who's going to take care of your little brother and sister? As a result of this you will not have time for the activity your principal wants you to do. You have to go home and cook your family dinner because dads not around and mom works 12 hour shift so you know she's going to be to extremely tired and she's not going to want to cook so It's your job now you're going to feed mom and or your brother or sister. If you have to play sports how are you going to feed them?\n\nSecond, you always take care of your sibling so how do think your mom is going to feel if you come home and say, \"mom I have to play a sport for school or I'm going to get In trouble.\" your moms going to be upset she does not want you to play sports because she does not have the money nor time to take you and pick you up she wants to go home and sleep. She has to have your help with your brother or sister because she has no one else to help her and she does not have the money for a babysitter after school.\n\nLastly, she works extremely to late to take you to a game or practice she just does not have the time, sports can be hard for people and be overwhelm and that's a lot if you're going through family problems. Your mom works to late to get you and pick you up and take you there It's a lot of stress on both you and your mom.\n\nTherefor this is why I disagree with students having to do an extracurricular activity also, older kinds are vary responsible and take a lot of roll In the family trust me I know from experience I never had time to play sports always took care of my brother and the family through hard times.",

      "Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involved with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagree to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family.\n\nMy first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worried about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved.\n\nThere for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates.\n\nMy final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no one wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did. But in the other hand there are kid that only see their parents once cause they come from work very late and go to work very early and you have to go to sleep cause there is school the next day. It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club.\n\nThis is why i disagree that student should have to participant in an activity. There are so many stuff that student might have to do out of school that makes them not be able to join a club,sport or any other activity that they offer in the school.              ",

      "Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn't have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name's alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, \"Are you on your way to football practice?\" \"Unfortunately,\" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn't bad at football, he just didn't enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn't because too many people who didn't want to participate signed up. \"How's the student council?\" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. \"I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,\" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn't have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn't enjoy it as much because those who didn't want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn't have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren't interesting to them. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.\n\nThe first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students' after school activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after school activities.\n\nAnother reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they're being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won't be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn't interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren't provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don't wish to participate.\n\nIn addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don't want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you're on a team, whether it's a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn't putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who's not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they're interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyable if a student doesn't participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.\n\nGeneric_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team's effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. \"Guess what?\" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. \"What?\" Generic_Name replied curiously. \"I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!\" \"Congratulations, Generic_Name,\" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, \"See you later, Generic_Name.\" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn't have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team's effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.",

      "How many times have you stepped out of your comfort zone? Maybe once or twice? People always hold back in life from doing something they have wanted to do. Maybe they are scared or fear of being judged. They don't take opportunities when they have it and might regret it later. Having to do another extracurricular activity could open so many doors, for example, meeting new friends, trying something new, and maybe even finding something you're really good at.\n\nYou know when you meet a new friend, you're so excited and can't wait for all the fun things you guys will do together! If you did an extracurricular you could have so many of these moments. Making new friends expands your friend group. You can meet people that you probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been pushed to stretch your horizons. And all these people can introduce you to new things that they are interested in like their favorite movie, books, or even their own friends. You could do the same. At this point you might even have double the friends you had before you even did this extracurricular, wouldn't that be fun! Making new friends is just one of the many aspects of trying something new!\n\nFor most people their is always that one thing they want to try but never do. Maybe chorus, art, robotics, etc. When you do this extracurricular you finally get the chance to do that one thing you've always had in the back of your mind. Say you tried this new thing, you put in your all in it, and you didn't like it or you weren't good at it. That's OK! Now you know that you tried it. You have no regrets. And you're probably going to have fun along the way even if it didn't end up being your passion. Doing this extracurricular could get you to the activity you always wanted to do even if it's not your life's calling.\n\nMy dad always says, \"Don't knock it till you try it.\". Which basically means don't say you don't like it till you have given it a shot. This applies to so many things like sports, food the list goes on. This activity that you try could be what your really talented at. Maybe not given the opportunity you have never tried it. That would be so sad, getting a talent and you don't even know that you have it. That would just be a waste! If you get an opportunity like this it could lead to many things and even find what you were meant to do.\n\nTrying something new, making friends, and discovering what you're really good at is just a few of the possibilities if you do an extracurricular. Trying something different could open your world, and make you see things in a different light that maybe you looked down on before. You could finally find that one interest that you've been waiting for. And maybe that you're really good at too! Having to do another extracurricular helps you find friends and broadens your friend group! I really think that adding an extracurricular will benefit teens in many ways and really make them branch out which they probably weren't doing in the first place. ",

      '" What are you going to choose?" That is the sound of a student at a school which requires them to do an extra- curricular activity. Students enrolled at this school must do some sort of extra curricular activity, whether it is a sport, a spot on the yearbook club, or serving on the student council. I agree with the requirement of an extra curricular activity because it can help you find people with the same interests and lead you to new interests, it can help create a better community environment and it will help all the students mature and succeed in the future.\n\nParticipating in an after school activity can lead you to people that have the same interests and can lead you to other interests. i have been playing lacrosse for about 8 years now and as I\'ve played throughout the years, I have discovered many different hobbies through my teammates such as cheer leading, track and field and rock climbing. I\'ve also been able to make friends because I\'m on a different team every season. I have made about 3 lifetime friends in lacrosse. I think this can happen with school lead activities. I think by being part of an after school activity, you can make lifelong friends, find people with the same interests and discover new hobbies.\n\nDoing an after school activity can help create a better community environment. this kind of relate back to the previous statement about making friends.\n\nby making friends, you can create less bullying. there is this saying, "strength in numbers", and I truly think this would happen with an after school activity requirement rule. By installing an activity requirement, you would help build a bully-free community.\n\nLastly, an after school activity would help students mature and prepare them for the future. I babysit a little boy with downs-syndrome and i often take him to the park. When we leave, you tell he is a little bit more mature from when we first arrived. this is because hen has played with older kids and have copied their actions. I believe this goes with all kids. if we had an after school activity program and we put all the grades together, it would help the younger one mature but also the older kids could teach them how to do things that they will need to know in the real world.\n\nI think everyone should be involved in some sort of group, whether it be school related or not. Maturing kids, better community environments and finding new friends can all happen with a required after school activity program.',

      'Do you think students will have time to do at lest one extracurricular activity after reading this? Doing an extracurricular activity might not always bring good things to students. This can affect students in a lot of ways with other things they do after school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time, they can have other activities after school, and students can get stressed and tired.\n\nTo begin with, one reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time. Students will not have time to do their homework after school. They might not have time to finish a project they been signed or to study for a test. Students will not have time to go out and hang out with their friends or spend time with their families. For example, students will not have time to eat dinner with their families.\n\nNext, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might already do other activities after school. Students might already participate in after school sport but no play a school sport. If students are 15 years or older they can start working and some students might want a easy after school job. They probably want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school. For example, take dance classes or instrument classes.\n\nIn addition, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can get stressed and tired. If students get stressed their grades can go down and their parents can get mad. Students can get tired and sleepy in class and teachers will keep on saying, "keep your head up" during class. It will be hard for students to keep up with their work in class for example, they will not finish on time.\n\nFinally, students will not have time to finish their homework or projects they have and no time to be will their families and friends. They will want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school like other classes. If students do get into a extracurricular activity they can get stressed or tired and their grades might go down. This are the three reasons why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity after school.',

      "Imagine your principal said you had to participate in some type of extracurricular activity, how would you feel?\n\nWould you feel like you are being forced or unable to decide what you do in your life?\n\nWell, for many students this is happening to them.\n\nI disagree with this decision because, some students have things they have to do after school, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do, and some parents dont have the time nor the money to do extracurricular activities.\n\nFirst, some students have things they must do after school, at home some parents leave things for their kids to do that may prevent them from doing extracurricular activities.\n\nA parent relies on their kids to watch younger siblings so they dont get in trouble.\n\nIn the afternoon the students might have to go see or help a sick family member or friend.\n\nSometimes parents also leave lists of chores they expect the kids to be finished with before they arrive home, and its part of the kids responsibilities to get them done.\n\nAlso most teachers give out homework that the kids have to turn in next class, when these students have 6-8 classes and homework in most of then it may be hard to juggle anything else.\n\nSecondly, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do.\n\nSometimes kids just dont want to do something, it may be because of social life or their life at home.\n\nIts also their choice rather they want to do it or not, because its their mind and body.\n\nonly parents or guardians have the right to force their kids to do something, the school shouldnt be allowed to tell students they have to join extracurricular activities if the just dont want to.\n\nYour only a kid once and these students should be able to enjoy their childhood without having to cut out time for extracurricular activities they they are being forced to do.\n\nLastly, some parents or guardians dont have the time or money to let their child participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nSome parents only have enough money to pay the bills and keep foo on the table, they dont need to pay fees just so their child can participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nThe parent might not have the time off that they need to join the child in club meets or sports games, because they work long hours. Transportation may be a big issue, if the family has no way to get their child to the extracurricular activities then there is no need for the child to be forced to sign up for them.\n\nAlso club meet times, say if the parents live in the middle on nowhere and the kid has a club meet at five but the parents get off at seven the club times are not convenient for the family.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with this decision because, some students have things they have to do after school, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do, and some parents dont have the time nor the money to do extracurricular activities.\n\nWhy should a student have to do something when some families just cant afford it?\n\nDo you agree that students shouldnt be required to do extracurricular activities?         ",

      "Should students part take in a extracurricular? well I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because, it gets students more involved with his or her community and keeps students active and on their feet. This will teach students many skills that could benefit them in the future.\n\nFirst off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. For example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. Joining a sport discovered many things I didn't already know about myself. I learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. Therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.\n\nNext, Joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. This leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. For example, I joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my best friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into. That decision was one of the best choices i've ever made. In addition, You'll get to meet all kinds of people from around your community, learning more about them each day and everyday, how similar or how different they're from you. At the end of it, it is nice to see all different or similar types of people that are surrounding you in your daily life.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you should join an extracurricular because you can benefit so much off of it. Including many life skills that will help you such as, communication skills, leadership skills, listening skills and many more skills that will help you along your path. Getting to know the people around you is a nice experience that I think every person should have the opportunity to get.                 ",

A lot of students are already stressed about their regular classes and they are required to do an activity over top of everything?\n\nI strongly disagree with students having to do an extracurricular activity. We shouldn't have to do something we are not interested in. All you should have to do at school is learn. A bunch of students could easily get stressed out from everything.

      'Whenever you get home, do you do your homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don\'t then you are either a very responsible kid, or you have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and the other half go home and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because it teaches the students responsibility, helps them with college later on, and they won\'t be on their phones all day.\n\nOne reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach them to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while they are still in school, it will help them succeed in their later life as an adult.\n\nAnother reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can help with finding a college later on in life. If you chose a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really help you in the future when you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are really good at a certain sport by the time of your sophomore year, you probably have a very high chance of making it on your school\'s team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if they think you are good enough for their school, they will probably offer you either a full-ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that they can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by "earth gov" asked adults which college they went to and if they were involved in an extracurricular activity during their high school years. About 90% of adults said that they got into college due to a extracurricular they were involved in during high school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.\n\nOn the other hand, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. They already have enough stress as it is, we don\'t need to add extra weight onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can help teens not spend the entire after school time on their phones. The article "Are Phones Good for Teens" writes, "most of all teens have access to a smart phone, and once they are let out of school and get home, the average teen spends 5 to 76 hours on their phone instead of doing their homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities." Another article titled "Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College" states that "when kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat they are deeply involved in extracurricular activites like sports, working on their school\'s yearbook, or being on the student council of their school." If the universe was filled with more kids like these then the world would have a larger population of successful young adults than it has right now.\n\nIn conclusion all students should be obliged to be involved in extracurricular activities becuase it helps them learn how to be responsible in their future life, it can help student get into a good college and be successful in life, and it can keep students off of their phones all day. To save our earth, the first step is saving the future generation.',

      "Should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricular activities. Yes because they provide information and fun for the students. Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity because we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.\n\nExtracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.\n\nBy taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.\n\nBeing active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.\n\nExtracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. Extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",

      "If you were told that you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, how would you feel? While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them. Schools shouldn't take away student's after school time, that time is the only time that they get to relax.\n\nSchools have a limited option of extracurricular activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.\n\nA lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.\n\nAfter school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.\n\nWith all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.",

      'Why we can do what we want after hours.\n\nBy Generic_Name,\n\nThe idea of a mandatory after school or extracurricular activity is filled with huge flaws. From angry parents to legal trouble, this is me, "pouring gasoline onto the fire."\n\n1. Its a simple idea really. Make kids participate in extracurricular activities against their wills. More money to the school and things that college will look back on and say,\n\n"You were in the yearbook club in 8th grade, congratulations welcome to Harvard!"\n\nIn fact collages dont look at most things from middle school, colleges dont really care because middle school dost have college counting courses till about 8th grade. The things they look at are your activities in high school and your grades in high school along with your SATs. This means that depending on the school (middle or high school) this would be for no good reason than to give kids experience and make people pay money for their kids to participate in these extracurricular activities.\n\n2. This will make parents and kids mad. The addition of extracurricular activities means the violation of rights and possible putting people at health risks. Think about it, you miss a doctors appointment because you have to do this or suffer for not attending. You could have people with diabetes not have to correct things to eat after the extracurricular activity running them the risk of high or low blood sugar. Heart and lung conditions also. Its not good.\n\n3. Timing will be off put, if your already part of a sports team and try to balance two of them at once the intersecting times will get you in trouble on both side and will let your team down. Traffic will now be a problem considering students getting back near 5 or 6 and getting out in rush hour traffic. Meaning they get home later and and wont have enough time to work on important work they need for school. Not to mention not everybody can even attend after hour activities, doctors appointments, travel, family matters. This will spiral out of control fast causing parents and students alike to start taking action against the school.\n\n4. A revolt will happen, I\'m making this sound dramatic but it will. It will start with a majority of people saying "this is stupid" and not attending these extracurricular activities. This will start taking effect with everyone and now a lot of people will start leaving the extra curricular activities. Then you have to face the parents, very angry and annoyed phone calls saying "I cant pay for this!" or "We have no time on our schedule to deal with this!" Eventually if the mandatory extracurricular activities dont end or become optional. Parents will probably start filling complaints to the school board or Virginia legislators. Did i mention that keeping kids at school after hours against their will is literary kidnapping. An offense of the law. So this will end two ways, cancellation of the mandatory extracurricular actives by the school board or by VA legislation, or parents pulling their kids out of the school successfully lowering the productivity, ranking, and reputation of the school.\n\nSo after all of that, do you think its a good idea to make extracurricular activities mandatory? Ill lat you think about it.',

The reason why is because the students already have a lot going on for them they have 4 main classes they have to worry about Math, Science, English and Civics. Putting another class for them or activity is going to put a lot more weight on the students. For example if a student at the school has all AAP classes or honors classes they already have a lot on their mind to deal with for the student's classes like tests, projects and homework. Some students may already be participating in a activity outside of school like sports!\n\nI believe the students should have a choice to choose a extracurricular activity not to be obligated, because the students already have to deal with so much outside of school and in school too. Another reason why it's a bad idea is because the amount of time the students have.\n\nLets say they as in the students join the school football team they are most likey going to have practice after school and that takes up a lot of time from someone's day. They're going to have to stay after school to particpate in that activity. Now that narrows down the amount of time the student has to finish all their homework, assignments or other things the students do in their time. A add on to this something that is important to the students, The amount of energy they have. Energy is something that helps the students get through their days of school they need that to focus on what they are learning and keeps them awake in class. There is now a chance that the student is going to have to start staying up late to finish assignments because of the amount of time they now have in their day. This is going to have a huge impact on the student's life because now they are going to have less energy from how late they stayed up. It's going to cause the student to be more tired in class and is most likey going to fall asleep in class and they are going to miss out on the important information they need for that class.\n\nIn a persons life two things matter, their time and their energy. Without their time they aren't going to be able to get a lot of things done. Without energy they won't be able to finish much either because they're too tired to do anything. There's a lot of risk of putting another class onto the students these just being the main effects and risks they may have to a student's life",

      '"Get up and try something new," someone once said. Imagine if the local school had fun activities after school that got students minds off of all the stress in their lives. I agree with this statement because extra circulars can introduce new friendships and create fun while exploring hobbies.\n\nAfter school programs can provide new friends. Many people that join a club or school sport are just trying something that they haven\'t before and need some encouragement from a peer or someone to talk to. When I joined the school play last year it was a requirement to tryout. I was very nervous, but with the help of the rest of the cast I sang in front of a whole crowd and was cast a role. Sometimes there are students who are in the classes of others and may never talk to them, extra circulars are the perfect time to ask them questions and make them feel comfortable. In my History class there was a girl named Generic_Name, she was very shy but also very sweet. We rarely talked until we both joined the Best Buddies program and were partners for everything, we became very good friends and still talk to this day. Lastly, there is a chance to meet someone with similar interests as others. My mother met her best friend from the school basketball team when she was in junior high, they both loved basketball and continued to play together throughout high school. Extra curricular activities can bring together so many people and create new friendships.\n\nAfter school programs can bring so much excitement and joy into students lives by trying new hobbies. Extra circulars come in many forms such as; plays, art, sports, or even technology clubs. By joining a sports team the coaches provide fun activities while still exercising, and in a club like the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) the leaders teach life lessons and helpful skills. I am a NJHS leader and our goal is to plan meetings after school that others enjoy while being informed as well. In these programs there may be a hobby that people never knew they liked. My friend went to the field hockey interest meeting and learned all about the sport from real players, she had so much fun that she tried out for the high school team and made Varsity! The activities are also beneficial to more than one group of students. Some kids with disabilities stay after school waiting for a ride home from their parents, as a result programs were created for scholars to stay with them and help do entertaining projects. At many schools they have the "iCan Bike" club, a club also for kids with disabilities to learn how to ride a bike without training wheels, using help from student volunteers the club fund raises money for the Special Olympics. Extra curricular activities make trying new things fun and helpful.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These programs can help others meet new people that are similar to them and create enjoyment with taking part in new hobbies that will provide happiness.',

      "I disagree with the principal's opinion or option because not everyone likes the listed activities or sports, or they maybe might just not do sports at all. It should only be a list of people who are actually willing to participate and follow directions, not just participate because they have to or are being forced to. Sports aren't meant for everyone or you might not just have the ability to do sports, if the students decide to not participate in sports or the other options it shouldn't be a big deal,some may not want to do an extra class. The principal's choice or option really shouldn't be a must. There should be an agreement with students about it and if some agree they should add extra options. not just sports, Work on the year book, Or serve on the Student Council. That is really only three activities and there might be more but not exciting or just not fun to do. That's why it wasn't mentioned and there is a lot of moving in those few options which includes excercising. So therefore I totally disagree with The Principal's opinion or option of making it a Must do. It can affect people's attendance. They could skip that class because Either they hate it, Maybe not their thing or choice, And not just skipping the class. They maybe just won't come to school at all when they have to do the activity they chose. And that's not what the principal is trying to prove or achieve. The Principal wants excercising and moving but students don't. and also aswell complaining. Students may whine a lot to their teacher saying stuff like I don't want to be here or disrespecting The Teacher who gladly decided to help out. So in my opinion I think it's just better to keep it the way it is right now and not add the option of must do sports or the other activities.",

    ESSAY:
      "Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all\n\nGeneric_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students and tremendously decreases the time that a student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.\n\nGeneric_School students should not have to regularly participate in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.\n\nGeneric_School students should not have to consistently partake in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called \"Generic_Name's Work Zone\" or \"WWZ.\" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name's Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be. That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.\n\nI strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact.",

      'I disagree with the principles decision to force the kids to participate in extracurricular activities because, First some kids might not have time for the activities, secondly some kids have non school related activities, and lastly some kids may not like the activities they get to choose from. Generic_Name came home crying thinking about what the principal said in the assembly,"The teachers and I have come to the decision that everyone must participate in at least one extracurricular activity starting in two weeks." "I cant do that!", Generic_Name said crying on his bed. "I have travel soccer, and if I miss practice I\'ll get kicked from the team." Generic_Name put his hands over his face and said,"what am I going to do?" "I need to tell the principal that he cant make kids participate in school related activities." So Generic_Name sat down and started to wright.\n\nDear Principal Generic_Name, I got three reasons why you shouldnt force kids to do extracurricular activities. The first being some kids dont have time for the activity chosen, or given to them. For example, If you have a little sibling and your parents work late hours you have got to be there to take care of them. My friend is a good example of this because his parents always have late work hours, and so he needs to take care of his three sisters, But he cant do that if you make him do an extracurricular activity. My second example of this is my friend Generic_Name. He has very stricked parents and they dont allow him to stay at school past 3:45, and if he does he gets in big trouble.\n\nThe second reason being some kids have non school related activities. A lot of kids I know have sports after school and sometimes its there only fun of the day. Im a good example of that because, I have travel soccer after school and sometimes soccer is my escape from the teenage world. Another good example is my best friend Generic_Name. He plays travel hockey, and if he misses a certain amount of practices he will get kicked off the team and that will break his heart, so do you really want to be the one that breaks all thees kids hearts?\n\nThe theerd and final reason being that some kids may not like the activities that they have to choose from. For example a kid I know only likes the sport fencing, But unforchanetly the school doesnt provide that activity, so he will have to go and do another sport that he wont enjoy. The last example is a kid i know that doesnt even like sports. for instance she is not athletic, and she cant throw or ketch a ball, so she would be miserable in the activity shes in. To add on to this I saw her face after the assembly, she looked like she was about to cry. The point of me writing this is so people dont come to school and see all of the sad faces, and the last thing we want is a bad reputation of this great school.\n\nTwo days after Generic_Name turning in his essay he was called in to the principles office. "Generic_Name!", Mr Generic_Name said in a hard voice. "You make a good point in this essay." "Really?"Generic_Name, said in a surprised tone. "Indeed, I havent read an essay this good in a long time." "Im going to make a special announcement this morning about this, so make sure you are listing, OK?" "Yes seer", Generic_Name said with a big grin on his face, and went off to class. Wail Generic_Name was in class talking about what just happened the announcements came on. "Good morning everyone, I have a special announcement today." "I had a kid this morning come to me and widen my eyes about my decision at the assembly, and because of him I have changed my decision, so you dont need to participate in extracurricular activities if you choose not to." "Thank you Generic_Name, thank you." The hole school lit up in joy, and as the day came to an end,Generic_Name held his head up high and walked to his mom\'s car.        ',

      "Your sitting home alone with nothing to do wasting away with boredom, if so then you should do some extracurricular activity. I agree because, I think kids having to do extracurricular activities for school help them, and lets them help. These activities give kids things to do, may help them make friends, and gives them a chance to help others.\n\nFirst, extracurricular activities give young people something to do. This will get them out of their houses. These children have to go and help their team with the extracurricular activity that they chose. It will also make them use their brains. It teaches them to think outside of the box and to make creations from a thought. Lastly, it can also help them manage their time wisely. If they have other activities that give work or are near the same time, this will help them by learning what is more important or what they care more about. Some students might struggle to find time to do these activities, but they can chose what and when their activities should be.\n\nSecondly, these activities will help kids make new and lasting friendships. Make them work with others. Because these are all run by the school you will have to meet new people regardless, so why not try to make a lasting impression to the people you work with. Have them go on group outings. The children may not be friends with anybody yet and are looking for something to do, group activities are prefect, not only do you do fun stuff with your group, but also get to know them a bit better. They will help each other. If you have problems with home work or a problem with some one around school the others in your group can, and will help you with the problems that you may have. Kids may be shy and don't want to talk to others they don't know this will help them break the ice with a few people so they have some friends to hold them up.\n\nLastly, this gives them a chance to help others. They can help friends. if a friend needs help on understanding their part of the extracurricular activities or home work then you can help them to understand what they are suppose to do. You can help the school. If you are in student council and think of a way to better the school then you have the power to do what you think is right for the school and students. Finally, this give students a chance to help the community. The students could find ways to benefit the place where they live making it cleaner, safer, or in anyway better. If someone is having a hard time think of how good it would feel to help them out.\n\nExtracurricular activities do influence kids to better themselves, their school, and community. One way was giving these students something to do to improve themselves. Another is making new friends making others lives better helping both school and community. Last is helping others in any way needed for home work, a project, or just by listening. Think of how much better it would feel to help others even if you didn't want to join an extracurricular activity.",

      "My principal, Mr. Generic_Name, has just announced that all students are required to participate in one activity around the school. I think that is is a great idea for Middle and Elementary school! But some of the students don't like the idea as much. I agree with my principal's decision to require at least one extracurricular activity. Whether it's encouraging students to learn something new that they like, getting to know others and making friends, or to spark a new hobby/interest. Here are my reasons and elaboration as to why I think this.\n\nMy first reason is that some of your time in Middle School should be spent doing something that you enjoy learning. The Loudoun Times have written about other schools doing the same change as what Mr. Generic_Name just announced. A writer for the Loudoun Times interviewed students at one school and 1 out of 5 students interviewed didn't like the idea at first, but when the interview happened again in the middle of the school year, that ratio changed to 4 out of 5.\n\nAnother reason why at least one extra curricular activity is good, is that you get to know others and make friends! CBS reported on a camp that was held in the Summer for exactly one week, which had kids aged 11 to 14 from 10am to 7pm, with 23 kids total, and activities of hiking, four square, camping, and more. All of the students except one had reported making at least one friends that they, later on in the camp, gave contact information to. I know this isn't in a school setting, but this proves that students can be the same way when doing a fun activity that they signed up for. If you like Tennis for example, you can play with other people in Tennis that share the same interest.\n\nThe last sentence brings me to my next reason, which is sparking a new hobby/interest. The University of Virginia had 20 8th graders choose something new to learn. The options were, Guitar, Tennis, and Basketball. 16 out of 20 8th graders liked what they chose. The next day, having all of the 20 8th graders either choose something new, or choose something different, 13 out of 20 choose the same option that they chose yesterday. One student when interviewed, said that he liked Guitar and hoped he could learn more about it in the future. That one student probably now has a new interest of Guitar as well as the other students who chose their activity for both of the two days. The people who chose the activity for only one day at least have an idea of what isn't for them.\n\nI have just told you my reasoning! My 3 reasons have now told you why I support Mr. Generic_Name's decision of requiring at least one extracurricular activity. Making friends, getting to know other people, sparking a new interest, and having people choose something that they just want to see if it's for them. At least one of these reasons can help students when choosing their activity and make them feel better. Mr. Generic_Name clearly made the best choice for our school.",

    ESSAY:
      "Did you know schools in your area have decided all students must participate in at least one after school activity? Incredible news if you ask me. Being involved in extracurricular activitys has shown to have amazing results on young growing minds. They're good for your overall health, they improve your skill sets and have a helpful impact on schools.\n\nFirstly, Being required to do a type of interactive activitly are not only expressive and fun but improve you mental and physical health. For example when playing a sport you practice getting stronger, improving your active ability and are getting in shape. You gain muscle and strength throughout your body. Your running gets much cleaner and your breathing gets more controlled. When I was really serious about my dancing skills I noticed a huge build up of leg muscle. Through out the years I've gotten alot stronger in my core and arms. Mentaly being active can take your mind of off hard times in your life. If you had a bad day at school or haven't been feeling your best, being active can make you feel alot more calm and have less anxiety. It takes you to a safe place. Every child should have access to something like that and the fact that not all kids do needs to change. Personally when I get in a fight with my parents I like to go for a run outside or play vollyball with my friends. I always end up feeling happier. Sports can also allow students release any anger or upset feelings they have. Some kids struggle with mentle health issues and don't all have resources to help. Playing a sport or being active can allow you to get ride of the upset feelings in a healthy way that won't harm anyone. I notice this can be a way to cope. It's okay to be angry but it's not okay to take your anger out on others or cause harm. There's also many ways after school activties can improve your different skill sets, here's some examples in the following.\n\nSecondly, extracurricular activitys helps improve your different emotinal skills. You learn to be more dedicated. When you playa sport or apart of a club you're on a team and you need to be there for one another. When you miss a practice you're not only letting yourself down but you're letting your team down too. When someone misses a practice on my dance team it's hard for all of us. We have reblock dances or fill in peeple who arn't there. It's more work for us which is unfair. You also learn to be more motivated. You start to set goals for yourself and strive to achive those goals. It can work with your school and home life too. Motivation can also make you more confident and work harder to be successful. I used to struggle with feeling motivated but when I stared dancing I found a strive for working as hard as I can to get better. It can be stressful but it's worth it. Dedication is also a skill that is getting worked on. Being dedicatied is always doing your best no matter how easy something is. Dedication is found when you try your best and go above what is required. If your apart of a yearbook club you learn to stay dedicated to finish the book and make it look as good as it can. You don't give up when it gets too hard. Your school does alot for you and you should always give back to what you get in return.\n\nLastly, participating in after school activities helps improve you school. When being apart of sports your school provides, that's a way of donating money. You have to pay for things when you're apart of a team ( outfits, games ect). When giving money to your school it helps pay for field trips, better lunches, classroom design and lots more. My old school was able to have amazing field trips because we saved money from donations. Some after school activites can include art clubs, design groups and student council. We could make groups that help clean up trash around the school, let kids get creative and have art work around the school and create new ways students can express themselves and help others. The student council could be in charge of these groups and ensure work was being done. Finally after school groups and activites can help teachers and staff. School's are very dirty and it's a lot of work for only a few staff memebers to have to clean. Cleaning clubs could be a great way students can give back to our school. We could clean the floors, windows and bathrooms. Competive sports teams are a way to get our schools name out there so people pick going to our school rather than any others. If we have good sports teams that win parents will notice that and could end up sending their kids to our school. I have many friends that have moved schools to have better luck in getting into collage through good sports teams at their schools.\n\nIn conclusion, schools requiring all students to endore one after school activity not only shows they care but improves your health, adds to your skill sets and is very helpful for your school and making it a better place. Students may not be as joyful in the begging but will soon notice a huge postive change and outlook towards school everyday. What is your take on this topic ?",

      "Have you ever participated in an activity where you either loved or hated it? Well, believe it or not, I think that all extracurricular activities should be appreciated. Extracurricular activities are activities used to equip you with new skills that you may not have had before, not used to only have fun and learn nothing from it just because your parents forced you to do it. They are there for a reason, and should be taken advantage of. I agree with the decision of the principal for making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity for three reasons: it gives you the opportunity to learn a life lesson, it can improve your academic performance, and gives you a chance to make new friends.\n\nThe opportunity given to you to learn a life lesson can be rare. To learn a life lesson means to realize that this world we live in, isn't fair nor perfect. There will be times where you wish certain things had happened to make life better for you, but that just simply can't happen. Participating in an extracurricular activity can create memories and meaningful experiences that you can't experience anywhere else. It can also help with being disciplined, and can give you something to live for. That is why I think that taking part in an extracurricular activity can be life-changing.\n\nThe act of participating in an extracurricular activity can even improve your academic performance. Depending on the activity, it can motivate students to do better if a certain activity requires you to have good grades in school. Participation in these activities can relieve stress, and looks good on your resume for college applications. Experiences from the activity can be stored up in your brain to be used as background knowledge in the future. Those reasons tie into the fact that taking part in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory.\n\nA chance to make new friends is always exciting for everyone. Making new friends also means making new relationships with the people you care about. Having people that you care for, rather than having random strangers around you, doesn't give you a sense of loneliness. It brightens you up like the sunrise, when you see the first beam of light. Making new friends especially while participating in an extracurricular activity makes it more fun, and amusing. It gives you an electric shock of joy, making you excited to come back again the next time. That is why I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity would be beneficial.\n\nMany people say that students should have a choice whether or not they would like to participate in an extracurricular activity, but I believe that it should be more of the opposite. The opportunity to learn a life lesson, improve your academic performance, and make new friends are the three reasons why I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Therefore, when you meet a student that currently doesn't participate in an extracurricular activity, invite them to join you, or find an activity that you think they would enjoy. This would be a great opportunity for everyone because they would be able to relieve their stress, do something that they love to do, and would enjoy every second of the activity, spending time with the ones they care about the most. Overall, I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of all the benefits, and the giant footprint that it would leave on this planet.",

      "I would disagree I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity and I'll tell you my reason why I disagree.\n\nFirst reason It should be your choice if you want or don't want to participate in extracurricular activity. Somebody shouldn't decide how you make your own choice because you should be able to have the choice to do or not to do extracurricular activity.\n\nSecond reason why you shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activity is because you could be already busy with something else they shouldn't need anymore work or pressure on them. Also this would mean you stay at school longer time because of extracurricular activity.\n\nThird reason it will be harder to get in to the extracurricular activity that you want because since every student have to choose one it will get full much faster then normal. So that mean if you choose something you do like you'll have a unlikely chance of getting it and then get something you don't like.\n\nFourth reason you can't find something that you'll want to choose for a extracurricular activity because you could get bored very easily. It would also be hard to choose if you are also very picky because you don't have many choices to choose from.\n\nFifth and final reason no one can come and get you after your extracurricular activity. A lot of parent have jobs that make them work late and then they don't have time to pick you up and that a problem because extracurricular activity are after school.\n\nSo these are reason why I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity.    ",

      "Should your Principal make you do at least one Extracurricular Activity?\n\nWhen your principal has decided that everyone should do an extracurricular activity, what would you think about that idea? If you want to do an extra activity at school then do things that could make you happy. Maybe try something new and you might be interested, learn more about it. I think that the principal should make kids do extracurricular activities but it should be optional. I will give reasons why the principal should make extracurricular activities optional and not something your forced to do.\n\nPhysical and Mental Strength\n\nIf you want to do an extracurricular activity then you should do one that you will really like and enjoy. Maybe you want to try something new, you can learn a lot from trying something new and you might even like and enjoy it. Maybe your very distracted about something going on at school or at home, you can try something you like and have fun. Doing a sport for your extracurricular activity can help you get stronger and improve your physical strength. You can hangout with your friends and make new ones, it can improve friendships.\n\nTrying New Things\n\nThere are pros and cons to trying new things. What if you don't like your activity or you are struggling to understand? You can ask a friend or an adult to help, you can also try to switch. Some people try new things and they really enjoy it, maybe you tried something new and really enjoyed it. It can be hard to learn something you never new about but it can be fun sometimes.\n\nNo Extracurricular Activities!!!\n\nSome people might not like doing extracurricular activities and that's fine. Many people might have things to do at home or places to go to. It can be useless and you probably know how to do many things. What if kids want to focus on their studies more than their activities? What if kids want to grow up being someone who focuses more in math or English but they have to do activities instead? Like what most parents say, \"Focus on your studies.\"\n\nWhat Would You Do?\n\nAre you interested in doing extracurricular activities? What would you like to do for your activity? Would you like your principal make everyone do at least one activity? Try to do an activity that will help you grow. Maybe something that you and your friends will enjoy so you can have fun while socializing. What would you do?",

      "About 57% of schools students participate in extracurricular activities. This means that over half of every school has students that already participates in an activity. I disagree with this decision because some students do not have time after school, don't have the transportation afterwards, or not interested.\n\nWith this added, where will they find the time for their home life?\n\nFirst, I disagree because some students have a job after school. Some students have to work that job to help support, so having this added would just add to their stressful life. Second, some students have to help their families with things such as chores, make dinner, etc. If they have to stay at school longer, some of those important things wouldn't get done. Third, as we get older we get more homework and harder tests, so it's up to us to keep up with it. After school is the time where the students get to study or do their homework, so when would they do it if they have to stay after school everyday?\n\nNot every student has transportation afterwards, so what do students do when no one can pick them up? First, parents are busy people and have jobs too. Some parents just can't leave work to get their child. Second, if they don't have a ride, they will have to wait with a teacher until someone can pick them up. Thats not fair to the teacher, but to the student too. Third, students would have to bug other busy parents to ask for a ride home. Their friends parents can't always take them home, so on those days how do they get home?\n\nSome students just aren't interested, so why make them do something they don't want to do? First, if they are not interested, they most likely wont be paying attention. If the students not even paying attention, whats the point of even having them there? Second, they would be distracting the people that want to be there. If a student isn't into what they're doing, they are most likely gonna move a lot, make noises, or talk to the people around them. Third, they most likely wont put any effort in what they are doing. No one wants to be around the kid that doesn't do their work, so whats the point in them coming if the aren't going to put in the effort?\n\nIn conclusion, that's why I disagree with the decision. I believe that every student should have the choice of whether they participate or not, due to those factors.",

      "I agree with this 100%. Choosing an Extracurricular Activity is very important. Let me tell you why\n\nExtracurricular Activities can help with Social Skills. For Example if I am suffering from depression it gives me the chance to do something that would take my mind away from the depression. Another reason would be if you have anxiety you can play or choose an activity that relaxes you and just lets you escape from all the anxiety around you. One major point is working better with other people. Extracurricular Activities can help you as a learner work better with others. For Example my Granddad is in the Construction business and when you have jobs like that and teaching and pretty much any job you have to know how to collaborate with other people. This brings me to my final point Extracurricular Activities can help your Social Skills.\n\nThese Activities can help with Social Activity as well. Like for example it give people who might not have friends or the best of friends a chance to make new ones whether it is through Sports or another type of Club. Another reason is because it gives you the opportunity to get closer and create a bond with friends and maybe even family. Plus there are many different clubs to choose from. These activities can help you stay fit and healthy as well. It also gives you the opening to meet new teachers and coaches that you might be able to start a bond with.\n\nThere are many different options to choose from. If you like sports you could play football or basketball or even soccer or baseball. If you like to test your brain power you can join chess or checkers club. And last but not least if you like to speak in front of people public speaking. This is one of my classes that I strongly encourage people to take to help with speaking in the workplace. Art is another option if you like being creative.\n\nSo my conclusion is choosing an Extracurricular Activity is important especially in High School and College.",

They may be locked in their house and can't do anything but school. Also they might be doing nothing just sitting in their house.\n\nEven if they just want to have fun and do something. They can just go to school and do a activity. So then you can have fun with your frenids and do what u love.\n\nIt would be a good help for some people. They may have insety.

It can also be helpful by being a leader, if you want to do sports you can become stronger and more healthier, and the activities you do can also benefit your life in the future, for an example my dad said when he was little he really didnt play sports but when he start liking sports he started to get stronger and so now he gets paid for playing football in the NFL. And to be honest it not all about sports in this reading because other activities like serving in the student council and working on the yearbook can get you to good places academic wise like a good college and a good job.\n\nOne time me and my friends was doing art for an activity and a famous painter came and gave the three of us free passes to take drawing lessons with him, all of us was so excited! See look if we would have never did the activity we would have never got those free lessons and now we might become famous painters/drawers.\n\nThere are a lot of other activities but my favorite activity is cooking because cooking can take you a lot of places in the world and I love to eat. There are about 93% of people that cook in the\n\nWorld and thats a lot of people. You can even use cooking for yourself and others. You can use cooking for yourself by cooking for yourself like how are you going to survive without eating and if you cook for yourself than you can save money by not paying for other food.

They could be playing sports outside of school and can't play on the school team or do other activities outside of school. What time frame would these activities start and end, some students might not be able to make it to those activities. If these activities start early some students might not have enough energy or be to tired to do these activities. Some students might not be able to make it to these activities or be to tired from school and just want to go home.\n\nIf students do not like these activities schools should have more options such as after school clubs, music, art. Students should also suggest ideas that they think is fun and would like to do. Students should have to sign up for these activities only if they know they will do them and have enough energy. The schools should also inform the students parents/guardians that they will be doing this activity.

How would you feel if your principle has made this decision?, and would you agree with this or disagree?. I feel as though, the principle has made the right desicion. People might not agree with this but, all I can do is speak for myself.\n\nWhy, do i agree with such a thing?. I agree with this desicion because, this desicion could do everyone some good. Doing some type of sport or even working on the school news paper could be fun. It would be expecially good for parents. Why? you might ask because, the students won't come home as early, and the parents will have time to run erin's and get some stuff done before their children get home. The parents will also be able to just have more time to their selves.\n\nAlso, this could be helpful to the children mentally and physically. Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television. These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren't up to par to look like \"pretty\" people they can get sad and form some type of depression.\n\nOverall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity's to the students day can help with that. building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you'll atleast know some key factors to living. Building social skills is great too. Lets say you get a job in marketing, you need to be social, have great speech, and be outgoing. In fact, you need social skills for any job. The principle making the desicion to add an extracurricular activity's to students day at school was and great idea.\n\nIn conclusion, adding an extracurricular activity to all of the student body would be an great idea because, it could be benifial to students, parents. and teachers. Building social skills. Life skills, and just being productive has all to do with adding an extracurricular activity to a students day. I think i have stated what my opinion is and what i agree and disagree with. What my opinion is, is that the principle making that desicion is wise and thoughtful.",

      "The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These extracurricular activities include sports, student council, work on the yearbook, and other activities. This will force students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. I disagree with this requirement, for it can be stressful, it forces the students who dislike these activities to participate, and it takes away time for their other responsibilities.\n\nFirst, students might find extracurricular activities stressful. Students who dislike having to work with others are forced into an uncomfortable situation when they are forced to participate in extracurricular activities along with other students. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and some students may not be able to because they have responsibilities at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of homework and other responsibilities at home.\n\nThen, their grades may drop. If a student is required to leave class for their extracurricular activity while doing something important in class like notes then their grade may drop because they missed that work. Students may have work for an extracurricular activity and that work may pile up with work from their other classes. For example, My friend Generic_Name does student council and we were taking notes in class when they made an announcement for all student council members to meet in the library and Generic_Name ended up missing all of the notes for the test the next day.\n\nAlso, students may have other responsibilities at home. Students my have responsibilities at home like walking their dog, cleaning the dishes, doing laundry, and other responsibilities. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and that takes away the time for the responsibilities the have at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of my homework and other responsibilities at home.\n\nHowever, students may enjoy extracurricular activities. Students may choose to participate in extracurricular activities, for it can be a way to have fun, you get to spend time with friends, and it gives you a time away from all of the stressful school work. For example, I do not get to spend time with friends during class because we are working and extracurricular activities can be a way for me to see friends and have fun. That is why some students may choose to participate in these extracurricular activities.\n\nIn conclusion, Students who are forced to participate in after school activities may lose time for school work, responsibilities, and personal time. When a student is forced into an activity that they dislike it they might slack off and that can distract other students who care about their activity from thier work. Students should have a choice of what they do during and after school because it can affect their attitude towards their school work. That is why I disagree with the principal's requirement.",

      "Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.\n\nStudents should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school because it can help you make new friends, help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity, and can improve your skills on specific things. If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people, but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy because most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured.\n\nBeing in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that. Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.\n\nGeneric_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. When he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high school and was really looking forward to it.",

      "I feel as if everybody should be in a club or on a sports team or at least just engaging themselves with something else instead of regular old school. I agree with my principal with making it so students have to participate in a least one extracurricular activity because, everybody needs something to do outside of school. You can join a club and meet new friends and new people, you can find things that you like to do that you never even knew you liked.\n\nEvery kid needs to be doing outside of school, i heavily suggest sports for kids, more importantly a team sport. Being on a team sport teaches you how to be a leader and a team player. At the same time you are getting great exercise that your body needs. Kids need to be kids and having them play sports is a great way to let them go and be kids. You learn a lot of valuable life lessons when you play a sport, some that might stick with you your whole life. Also kids doing something like playing sports or volunteering somewhere can help from get kids off the streets getting involved with drugs and committing crimes.\n\nBesides sports and doing things outside of school, another great way to get into and extracurricular activity is joining a club. Joining a club could be beneficial for someone who has a hard time making new friends. If you join a club you might find yourself interested in something you never even knew that you liked. Say you have a hard time making new friends, if you join a clubs that has to do with something that you really like you are bound to find some new friends because you are surrounding yourself with other people who have the same interests that you do. Also more schools should have more variety of clubs and things to do after school to make school a more enjoyable place.\n\nAnother great thing about participating in extracurricular activities is that you can find new hobbies that you like that you never even heard of or that you've never tried. If your not sure if you should join that club or play that sport just do it, because if you don't and you realize what could've been a good experience is thrown away because you did not want to try anything new. It's okay to step out of your comfort zone every now and then. It may be fun or it may not, you just got to find yourself and what you like, experimenting with things is great for you. Don't second guess yourself, the more you second guess the more your talking yourself out of doing it.\n\nIn conclusion it should be schools jobs to make sure kids are putting themselves in clubs and sports etc. to succeed and have a better life. I highly agree with my principle making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity inside and outside of school, my principle needs a raise.             ",

One reason why Being forced to participate in an extra curricular activity could benefit these kids is because it could make them more have more hobbies and goals. The next reason why making them participate in extracurricular activities would be good for them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and become successful of them. Another reason why forcing them to participate would be good is because It could allow them to develop better social skills and become a better person.\n\nOne reason why forcing them to do activities would benefit them is how they could develop new hobbies and goals. For example, when I started swimming my parents forced me to go to practice even when I did not want to. Now I am a competitive swimmer and enjoy going to practice because I have goals that I want to accomplish. This example shows how making someone participate in something can sometimes benefit them by giving them new hobbies and goals. Another example is when my parents signed me up for the river hawk running program at my school and I did not enjoy running. But now I have made running one of my hobbies and I will try out for my high schools cross country team. This example shows how I was being forced Into running and started out not liking it but now I do. These examples show how being forced into doing something can benefit you by giving you goals and a chance to pursue something.\n\nThe next reason why I think making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and then become successful in them. An example is how my parents forced me to swim and now I will be on TV swimming in Florida at the national level for my age group. This example shows how I was successful and because I was forced to be a swimmer I made it on TV. Another example is how my mom forces me to go to school and I have become a successful student and have been getting all A grades. Another example of how making students participate in an extracurricular activity could make them more successful Is how my brother became a successful piano player. My parents made him start taking Piano lessons and now he has become great at Piano and may try to become are school Piano player. This example shows how my brother became successful by my parents making him start piano. All of these examples show how It would be good for the principle to make the students participate in an activity because it would make them a more successful person.\n\nAnother reason why making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them Is how they could develop better social skills and become a better person. An example of this is when I was in fourth grade and I did not like to talk to people. But when my parents signed me up for a activity after school that would help go around helping people and do food drives I became involved with the program and started to talk to people finding ways to help others. This example shows how I developed better social skills and I became a better person by helping others. Another example of how extracurricular activities help develop my social skills is when I joined my first Triathlon team I had work hard to keep up with my team and cheer for other teammates. This example shows how I was using social skills to cheer for my teammates and why extracurricular activities could benefit students.\n\nI agree with Making students do extracurricular activities. One reason why I think making kids do extracurricular activities would be a good Idea Is because they can develop new hobbies and make goals for themselves to achieve. Another reason why I think they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity is because they could find new activities that they enjoy and become successful in them. And the last reason why they should participate in an extra curricular activity is because they can develop better social skills and become a better person. Overall I think that students should be made to participate in an extracurricular activity because it can make you a better person.",

    ESSAY:
      "Should all students be required to do an extracurricular activity? Yes, I do agree that all students should do some form of activity. There are many types of after school activities that students can participate in, including clubs, sports, debate teams, and so much more. I myself have done so many extracurricular activities. So many I couldn't count them all. I do believe that all students should do a extracurricular activity because, it can improve friendships and social interaction, encourage good exercise and motivation in work, study, and nutrition habits, and make it easier for students with health problems to interact with other kids their age and feel involved.\n\nFriends are very important in our lives. When were kids mostly everyone finds that one person who you can laugh with, make jokes with, have your own secret language, and just be kids! If you ever had that one person, think back to how you met them. Did you just bump into them going down the street and all of a sudden ya'll were best friends? That might be a slight possibility but fighting the odds you most likely met your childhood best friend by doing something that you like to do. Thats right an activity! Children need best friends and whether they try out for the football team or join the debate team, I do believe that you will find a new best friend.\n\nAlthough friends and a very important thing in a stable childhood, exercise and motivation has just as much as a positive or negative consequence on your life. Motivation is a enormous thing that can push you to do anything that you want to do. Joining teams and clubs will not only make you friends but give you peers and trusted adults that will be right behind you for whatever you choose to do. Motivation is also the key to exercise. exercising as a kid will keep you a happy and healthy person for years to come. As the years do come youll find yourself in great habits, keeping yourself healthy. Healthy habits are not the only thing. Its proven that the happier and healthier you are the more you may put into your life. If you just sit on the couch all day not doing anything, your not going anywhere with your life. Good exercise and good motivation are very important things and inheriting those traits just from joining a sport or club, is a huge win.\n\nNow lets talk about the children who are physical and mentally challenged. Yes, they might not have the same mindset as you and me, or can't move some part of their body, but that does not mean that they shouldnt have just as much as a chance as you and me. I think incouringing special education students to enjoy the wonders of childhood are just as important as it was for everyone else in the world. When you involve these children, at that second they won't see that their different, they will see that their with kids their age having fun. Because their kids, they should have equal opportunities as other kids. Let them join that sports team if they are willing to do and and have their mind set on what they want to do. Who is to stop them?\n\nAs more and more children start to do extracurricular activities more and more will follow. So Yes, I do believe that children should be pushed to do extracurricular activities, because if they dont, they might have just given up a huge part of their childhood that they might never get back. As you get older you might still have that best friend still sticking around, or you might still have those study habits and healthy habits, or you might have had been a person that decided to be such a kind person and have that special education kid join your friend group as because you knew everyone needs a friend. No matter what it is, all their is to know is that you gained something so positive that will be stuck with you for decades.   ",

      "I think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. First it could interfear with there scedule, second it could get in the way of school and lastly it could induce stress.\n\nFirst the childs scedule. Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.\n\nSecond it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.\n\nThird is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress. The activites could cause the child to lost sleep and that could leave the child tired and stressed for the rest of there school day. Next it could cause to much stress and that can lead to unwanted sideffects, like hair lost pail coloring of skin, hair loss and suicidal thoughts which isnt good.\n\nThats whyI think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. ",

      "All students must do at least one extracurricular activity. That's what the principal said. I agree with his statement because students are allways stressed about home work,missing work,getting in trouble and friends. An extracurriculer activity is ment for you to have fun and be your self. Lets say your working on the year book and it is a lot of work but the whole school depends on you to do a good job. Now sports sports are a cool way to make friends and have teamwork that way you can acomplish your goal as a team.\n\nEvery student has a life out side of school whether that be waching tv,playing video games,spray painting biuldings or walking dogs. They all have lives but not a single one of them is the exact same. That's why we can get the kids who are good to have fun and the kids who are bad out of trouble. We could make the town a better place one kid at a time. This idea will also help with kids who don't have good grades.\n\nBy not letting them play or commpete if the dont have good grades that lets them work harder to get better grades.\n\nA big part of life is being productive. Being productive is insted of me playing with my phone I help my dad fix a pipe. It's about getting thigs done and being usefull with your time. some kids dont play outside dont talk to their friends the play video games and wach tv. why do that when you could be playing sports,working on year book photos,talking on the debate team and doing there work for school. It's all about getting things done. That is why I think all students should do extracurricular activitys.    ",

      "Have you ever done something you didn't want to do because your parents made you do it? This makes you annoyed at your parents because they just ignored what you wanted to do. It is bad enough that your parents make you do the activity, but what if your principal made you do it. This is why I disagree with our principal making us do extracurricular activities. It is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.\n\nIt is our life not the principals. If we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. Principals job is to be in charge when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. Life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. We are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. We should get to decide our own path not the principal.\n\nMost kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. They might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. Extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.\n\nKids don't always have time. Some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. They need their families help to fight through these tough times. If they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. If the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. Everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.\n\nI disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. I don't think forcing people to do them is the answer to every bodies problems. Extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. It should be up to the family what is done not our principal.",

The activities you are asking the student to participate in might not be something to enjoy or somrthing they want to do. Also some students may not have the time to do the activity at hand.\n\nAlso if the activity is something physical , the student might have a condition that causes them not to be able to do the activity.\n\nTime is every thing it is something we depend on all the time in our daily lives. Students need time to do the things they have planned as well. Others may have other activites outside of the school activities requested. Some students may want to study rather than do an activity that they know they might not have time for. Some students may have bad grades and want to bring them up and needs that time to do his or her work to bring their grade up. If the time of the activity doesn't fit within the time on which the student is free how will they be able to do the activity?\n\nThe second reason why i don't belive it is important to participate in an activity is because, the student might not any of the activities listed that they would be interested in. Student might want to do this activity simply because of the way the student thinks of the activity. A lot of people are not interseted in doing another acivity because of the are already in or just don't want to do. This also raps around the fact that the student may not have the time to do so and that he or she has enough work or extra things to do regarding themselves. It's the students opinion on what they want to do.\n\nI belive the students should decide on whether or not it's a good choice to have this in place. If the students vote and make a decision they can make a reasonable conclusion that helps every student affected by it. After hearing what the students recomend to the principal, then the principal might not carry on with his decison if it's helpfull or not.

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps with college prep, helps with stress, and doesn't take much time.\n\nWorking on a extracurricular can helps you prepare for college. When you send in your college application they not only look a grades but what you bring to the table. If you play football they might want you for there football team or if you play in band they might want you for there school band. Colleges also give out scholarships for certain activities. If you were good enough at your extracurricular you may even qualify for financial help to pay for college. It shows that you can stick with something and that you are a hard worker and you can keep working even when something is new and difficult. Colleges look at these kinds of things its important to be prepared and accomplished.\n\nTaking a break in the middle of the day and going to a fun class that you choose can really help with stress. It lets you take a break between your academic classes. You some times end up sitting for hours doing math,science, and reading you can become tired and stop focusing. Taking a hour to thirty minutes to stretch, run around, and talk is good for you it can help with your drowsiness and boredom. Taking a break and doing something you love and enjoy could only benefit you. Sports or things like art also improve motor skills and can have a calming affect they can also increase melitonin production in your brain which helps with anxiety and depression. Not only does this mean that it can help with any conditions you may have but also allows personal improvement to take place. Taking time for yourself and picking a class you will enjoy can help you reduce stress.\n\nSome people may say that its a wast of time and you could be doing something academic with that time and that other activities would be more appropriate for the school day. however, there are academical purposes for these activities you could learn a language or take a extra class to get help with math. It is all up to what you want to do with that extra class. Spending six hours of your day sitting and doing work only to get a break to eat is not good for you. If changing that means you waste a half a hour to just run around or talk then so be it.\n\nSome my look at these classes and say they are a waste of time and a distraction from the important classes but the also help in the long run.\n\nStudents need to take a break and join a class they enjoy it will help them with college prep, although them to take a break, and is a good use of there time. There are many benifits to allowing your self time to work on personal goals and make time for yourself\n\nIt doesnt need to be a large amount of time or the most acidemic class it just needs to be a class that you enjoy. ",

Adding the rule that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity would be a fantastic way to make sure that students are getting involved with their school. There are so many choices for everyone in the school. From sports, to crafting, Future Business Leaders, and many more, students are sure to find something that they enjoy. Doing extracurricular activities can help make friends, keep you active, and form a second family away from home. It can also help you later in life with time management skills, and help keep your grades up.\n\nA benefit that comes with joining a team, club, or organization with other people is making friends. It's hard to make friends at school because of constant changing classes and so many people split up. Especially when it comes to sports, you can form a second family. Being on a team, you know that people have your back during a game. After being involved with the same group of people, you start to form a bond that makes everyone so close. Having an outlet with people that you know, and are close to, can really have a positive impact on you're life.\n\nLater on in life, students will remember the work that they put in, and remember the friendships that they made. The habits of time management that come with being a part of multiple things at one time will stick with them. This includes having to wake up early to go to a practice, or meeting. Also being organized and prepared is a big part of the responsibilities that come with joining a group. To be allowed to be in extracurricular activities, you must be a student in good standing. Which means you need to be passing all your classes in order to do anything before of after school.

      "Basketballs get thrown around, paint splashes onto paper and adolescence start to open up their minds to logical thinking. Extracurricular activities should be required in schools because they help students release stress, help thinking in a new way, and makes school enthralling to those who have not been blessed with natural intelligence. Extracurricular activities can improve many students lifestyles.\n\nA long day of tiring work builds up unnecessary stress. Students are packed with homework in subjects they may not enjoy. To end their day with an activity they enjoy can make a horrific day into an enthralling experience; for example, majority of people like spending time with others who they have things in common with. Growing up, it was hard for me to socialize, it felt as if everyone else was functioning faster than Ic was. After a day that felt as if the human population was filled with nothing but sorrow, I finally got to go home and feel the crystal clear water cool my body down, as my team practiced steadily for our swim competition. To have a kid feel relaxed and at peace will improve what they think as they wake up on Monday mornings.\n\nIn the school I have attended for junior high, I am required to take classes that focus on music. In the sixth grade, I chose orchestra because it was an amusing experience to see how one movement in my wrist could cause a pleasant noise to be heard throughout the room. In my science class, we had moved on to the sound unit and i excelled while many other students did not. When my science teacher used words such as octaves, pitch, and harmony it wasn't difficult to understand. The extracurricular activities I have taken have opened my mind into a more creative way of thinking. They taught me that there is more meaning on a paper than what is written in ink.\n\nOne of the many symptoms of depression is memory loss. Since my mother had suffered from the illness, it was genetically passed down to me. Even as a child it was clear to me that school was mainly about memorization. When teachers talked about how we had learned topics in prior years my brain scattered through the many memories in my head but was unable to remember anything. Extracurricular activities aren't about your ability to memorize, but your motivation to excel. That's why it will help students who are more academically challenged would more likely enjoy these activities.\n\nActivities a student enjoys can introduce them to experiences they didn't know were possible. Extracurricular activities help students release stress from the hardships of their day, show them a way to think that they haven't seen before, and is beneficial for those who believe they are not intelligent. I believe that they would be helpful to students and help them excel in the future and should be required in schools.",

      "Do you think every student in you're school should participate in a extracurricular activity? All students should not be forced to do something they don't want to do. This may be good for other students but not everyone has the time for extracurricular activities. Many students have things to do at home and extracurricular could be stopping them from doing them.\n\nExtracurricular activities take time away from students being with their family's, it would also take time away from activities outside of school like a sport they play or something that they participate in. Extracurricular would make students have no time to do there homework or finish any work that they need to do. Many students don't focus on extracurricular and they want to get a good grade. But extracurricular might make them not have much time to study or finish there work. And sometimes students just don't want to do any extracurricular activities.\n\nIf a student does not want to do a activity than they should'ent do it. And if all students have to do extracurricular than it would get to crowded and people will lose more interest in what they like to do as a extracurricular activities. Sometimes students have a hard day at school and they just want to go home and relax. Because they are stressed and don't want to do anything, but if they are forced to a extracurricular activity that they don't like than they will be even more tired and bored. Students need there own free time and choose what they want to do and they don't want to be forced to do something they don't like.\n\nSo in conclusion, students should not be forced to do extracurricular because they have things to do at home and they don't want to be stressed even more. Students go to school to learn, get good grades, so that they can get a good job. Students should be able to use there own free time and not waste it on extracurricular activitys, because they miss time with there family, they could miss out on something really important at home, and they wouldent have time to get to practice if they play a sport, all because of extracurricular that will take up most of there time. Students already have a lot of homework to and regular work to do at home and if there are required to do a extracurricular activity, they will lose a useful amount of time.    ",

      "At first it might seem absurd forcing kids to participate in extracurricular activities, but it would be beneficial for the students now and later in life. This is because the activities can provide students with life long important tools. For the benefit of the students, I believe that kids should be pushed to participate in extracurricular actives. I believe this will benefits the students in a variety of ways that include making new friends, being more productive, and allowing for more success in life.\n\nOne of the main reasons that making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be beneficial to students is the fact those activities allow for new friendships to be created. This is true because most extracurricular activities allow students to talk with each other, and talking with a person is the first step towards friendship. One of the biggest issues facing teenagers is depression, but if they had a place that made them feel comfortable that would help. An extracurricular activity would be perfect to make them feel like they belong. Those friends would also most likely stay with them their entire lives.\n\nA second reason making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be helpful is it could allow them to be more productive. This is because most extracurricular activities are only open for a small amount of time after-school, for anything fun to be accomplished they would have to be productive. Some activities like working on the yearbook, and student council have deadlines, which can teach students how or why to be productive in school. Teaching students about deadlines can also go in their future by preparing them for a college or a job.\n\nThe third main reason that making students participate in extracurricular activities is positive is it allows them to feel successful. It is important for them to feel successful because they will strive to be successful in other aspects of their lives allowing for more success that can also help them in the long term. One being if they join a good club then they can place that on their resume for college, allowing them to get a good job. On the contrary, if they didn't want to or couldn't afford college the club could go right on their resume in order for them to join the work force.\n\nIn conclusion, we should make students participate in extracurricular activities for many reasons, but the three most prominent being it will give them the chance to make friends, teach them about productivity, and will allow for success even after school has ended for them. Extracurricular activities allow for a students to create meaningful lasting friendships. They also allow for students to learn the importance of productivity for the future. The activities teach students how to be successful and why for short term and long term goals.",

      "I think that having to do a after school activity is a great idea. Some might think that they shouldn't but it helps. because it helps in the real world, it helps you be in better shape and it's fun. Those are some reasons, now lets get into deeper detail.\n\nDoing after school activities help in the future, especially if your trying to get a job. They help you with skills you will need to get a job. Like playing on a sports team and the fight to the #1 seed. Helps you because if your trying to get a promotion then you know how it feels to work hard for something that you want. there are also things that can help you get a job like helping take pictures for a yearbook. You could be a photographer.\n\nDoing after school activities also keep you in better shape by keeping you up after school instead of going home and doing nothing. Sports also keep you in good shape by exercises, running and conditioning drills. Also for sports you sometimes have to be fit and well put together so if your not your not making the team.\n\nThey are also fun, because for yearbook on school spirit days you get to be out of class taking pictures for people with school spirit. Also wearing your football jersey on a school day makes you feel like your in a high school football movie. It also feels so good to get on the field and make a play. One of the most fun things in sports if not the most fun thing is a bus ride back after a win.\n\nThose are some reasons why I support his statement on everyone should do after school activities. Because they will help in the future, they help you get in shape and they are fun. those are my reasons hope you like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",

      "Would you like your parents being disapointed in you beacause you didn't do well in your grades? They say your always focusing on school sports, being, council, etc. They think you don't focus on your school work. That might not be the reason, you could be struggling in your studies because of the school activity your told to do. i know my parents would be disapointed in me for having bad grades. I definetly don't support the principles decision of making it a requirement for students to participate in an activity.\n\nSome parents make their kids run errands, doing so may lead them to not be able to participate. They might have younger siblings they have to watch over which makes it hard as well. Students of extra assistance might not be able to do the activities. As the year will go by, studies will get more advanced. Students might get stressed, with the activity on their hands they might get more stressed. I know how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed as a student, things are harder to get done with being pressured. People have different things going on in their lives, it might be hard for them to go to school if there family are not in their llife as much. They could live far away from the school and have no tranportation for school or attending their own game practices.\n\nI think they should require only what is mandatory to pass the current grade students are in. Sport, running for student council, or participating in a school related event should be optional. Some people don't like participating in sports and all these other things, it just might not be their thing. Parents might wanna put their kids in tutoring after school because of their grades, but unfortunatly they can't because they got game practice or school duties. All of these problems caused by the principles decision will lead to students transferring to another school. It might also put a bad name on the school.\n\nThe staff and teachers at the school might be paid a smaller amount of money than their regular pay. If there are no students at the school, the teachers might quit their jobs. The school might shut down, we can't let this happen. If we all work together we can make a big change! We can talk the principle out of this, make students happy, and parents proud again! The parents and students lives wont be so stressful anymore.\n\nFinally, that is why i reject having to participate in an school activity. I want to study stress free and have my life at ease. Students should participate in school activities only if they want to. They shouldn't be forced to if it's not required. I would reccomend the principle to come out with more previleges to help students with their studies intead!",

      "Everybody works when their kids, and when their adults. Kids work so hard in school, and rack up so much homework, it overflows them everyday when they get home. When you have so much work, and so little time to do things you love like spending time with your family the homework gets in the way of that. School takes over your life which is a good thing, and a bad thing. It can be a good thing because you learn so much which can help you excel in life, but it can take the life you should be living when your a kid. A kid should be able to play outside with friends, and go to the pool to swim but they can't.\n\nMaking a kid have to do more school work, and stay longer at school would just give them more stress. More stress would make a kid become overwhelmed, and not do as well as they used to with less stress. Adding a extra activity to a kids life would just take away the name kid, a kid should be with his/her family, or outside running around. Schools need to have extra actives for kids, but they should never force a kid to do them.\n\nDon't make a kid work more and add more stress to their life you should be taking away the stress.\n\nAs a kid to much work just makes a kid not want to work. If you force a kid into adding an extra activity to their seclude it just ruins the childhood they should be having. A kid should make his/her own choices in which what they want to do as a kid. Kids need to have fun, and play around and be close with there family, but adding an activity is like adding a year to a prison sentence, you are stuck in some place you don't want to be at. I believe that all kids should get to chose either if they want to do the extra activities or if they don't. School is just one big heartbreaking place where kids have to sit around all day, and then go eat food which no one knows what it actually is.",

      "Generic_Name was running the fastest that she could, suddenly she cross the final line ; Everyone was screaming from joy. Most teenagers can't participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons.\n\nFor example, in Generic_Name experience was because she had to look after her brothers.\n\nOccasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when\n\nGeneric_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day.\n\nGeneric_Name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream.

For example, before Generic_Name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . Most teenagers don't like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do.

    ESSAY:
      "According to Dr. Maxwell Olchena, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains, participating in marching band can do one of two things depending on your personality, just wait until you see what his studies have proven! I think it's very important to do an extra curricular activity, but I do not believe it should be required, as we just do not have enough options for extra circulars to fit every student's desires. Some extra circulars, such as marching band, are not for the light of heart and truly are scary at points(especially drum line but we'll get into that later.) This is why students should do extra circulars, but it should not be a requirement.\n\nDr. Maxwell Olchena is a psychologist who has been studying the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains for almost 20 years, here's what his studies have shown: there are two things marching band can do to the brain of an adolescent, and however they are affected depends on their personality and nothing to do with IQ(Intelligence quota). Those with higher IQs tend to perform better in marching band, although marching band does not require you perform well(as hard work brings good performance.) The two things that can happen to the brain of an adolescent when they join marching band are, increased mood and productiveness, or decreased mood and productiveness, thats right. Marching band can do two polar opposite things to the adolescent brain. Dr. Olchena's studies have shown that when someone considered an extrovert joins marching band, their mood will decrease and they will become burnt out, this is because they aren't used to the amount of work put into their social life. Marching band is less a sport and more of a social activity, unless you are willing to accept it as your only family, you will not be happy and become very burnt out. Here's where Olchena's studies get crazy, introverts are more likely to have increased moods and increased productiveness when joining marching band. Olchena's studies have also shown that when and introvert joins marching band, they become more social, and those around them report and increase in socializing. Now here's where this relates to every extra curricular, Olchena had his friend, and fellow psychologist, Dr. Alan Russell study this in his area of study, debate team, and the exact opposite is true for this extra curricular. Introverts tend to lose productiveness and have a decrease in happiness, whereas extroverts tend to have increased productiveness and mood.\n\nDrum line, however, is where the studies get interesting. Dr. Brock Hayman, an expert in the effects of drum line on the adolescent brain, has discovered a new area of the brain that awakens the second you join drum line. This area is called the Drumbolow Cortex. When activated, this area of the brain never turns off. The Drumbolow Cortex does some weird things to the brain once activated, it can cause the person to do crazy things, such as picking up gum on the ground of the parking lot at band camp(This has actually happened before.) Other signs that this area has been activated are: inability to stop drumming, addiction to buying drumsticks, need to move up rankings in drumlins, and recruiting more people for the drum line. studies show that 90% of people do not even have this area in their brain, and fewer than 5% of the population has it activated.\n\nThese are all good reasons why you should join an extracurricular(*cough cough drum line cough cough*,) so why shouldn't it be a requirement? Dr. Brett Staudt, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on people's actions around family members, has the answer to your question. \"Those who chose to join marching band will become a disturbance to their family, they will become obsessed with showing their family shows by Drum Corps International, such as the Cavaliers 2011 show in which the drums are upside down. Most of the population does not care whatsoever about how amazingly cool it is to drum upside down, but any person who chooses to join marching band, even if they don't do drum line, will become obsessed with the fact that people have enough skill to play the tenors upside down.\" This quote says two things, you should watch the Cavaliers 2011 show, and also that marching band has negative effects on the life of family members of the person who chooses this curse/blessing of an activity, not to mention, you'll never see that person again because they'll always be at practice or hanging out with their marching band friends.\n\nAlthough I do believe it is a good idea to do an extra curricular, Dr. Nathan Strain has done countless studies on forcing adolescents to partake in things, and it causes them to be less interested in what they're doing. I would rather not have people in marching band who are there only because they've been forced to be there, as they will not work as hard because all they care about is the fact that they have to do it. When students have free will and the ability to make their own decision, they will choose what they feel is best for them self and we should let them do whatever they believe is best for their situation in life at the moment. You never know what else a student has to do at home just to have enough money for food, or to pay for other expenses.\n\nWhat I take away from this evidence is that we should not force students to participate in extra curricular, but rather encourage them to do so. Personally, joining drum line was the best choice(I'm kidding it was a mistake but I'm glad I made it) I've ever made and I will continue doing drum line for the rest of my high school and college career, although had I been forced, I'm not sure if I'd be as happy to be in it. I genuinely think forcing students to do anything will cause burnout and decrease happiness. I truly think students should make their own decision on if an extra curricular fits in their life or not.                ",

    ESSAY:
      "There are many different types of people at school. There are athletes, creative, hard-working, and many others. If they were told that they had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school, I think there would be multiple opinions about it. I think that students should not be forced into doing a school activity for three reasons. Their time, their effort, and their stress.\n\nThe first reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples time/schedule. If someone for example, would choose sports and the sports practices were after after school. If they didn't have the time to practice from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. or couldn't practice form 5:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. then it would be a pretty rough schedule. Another example is when I was playing basketball for my Middle School team. We had practice everyday and it was very tiring. Some people might just want to go home and sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv instead of doing a activity. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of time.\n\nThe second reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples effort. Some people might not like any of the options that the school offers so they might not put all their effort into whatever activity they pick. For example, if a very creative and artistic person looks at all of the options and they are all sport related they will not really care what they pick because that is not what they really like to do. Another example is when my cousins and I went to a arts and crafts place where you could build or draw anything you could imagine. I didn't put as much effort as some as my cousins because arts and crafts is not mt favorite thing to do. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of effort.\n\nLastly, I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of stress. Some people can get stressed out very easily when they have to do something new or there is a lot to do. For example, if someone was taking all of the most advanced classes you could take and then they had to choose something else to worry about could make a lot of stress. They would have a lot because of how much stuff they would have to worry about. Another example is when I was playing basketball and trying to study for 3 tests I had the next day. It was a lot of stress and made me get headaches because I was focused on too much. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of stress.\n\nI disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of three reasons. Their time and how it can make your schedule crazy. Their effort and how much a person likes the options or not. And lastly their stress and how it can make your life have to much to handle.  ",

    ESSAY:
      "If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities can help students with things like building new and helpful experiences, preparing for the future, discovering more about their interests, and socializing with their peers.\n\nJoining a certain group for an extracurricular activity can help you make experiences that can open up different pathways for you in the future. If you ever wanted to pursue a career in a certain field, extracurricular activities that you participate in now can help you prepare for what those might be. For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in a job like graphic design, it could be helpful to join an art club or even yearbook club. When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in. Yearbook club, for example, allows you to design a cover for the school yearbook, which would in turn give you the experience of designing covers. A poll performed by Oxford University has showed that 76% of people who now have jobs in the art field participated in some kind of extracurricular activity at school when they were students to help them learn more about what their future jobs would be like. It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college. Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom. The more activities that you participate in both inside and outside of school, the more qualified you are to go to certain colleges because of your strengths. It helps prepare you for different paths in the future. Participating in extracurricular activities such as clubs and teams can not only help you build experiences for the future, but it can also help you discover what you're passionate about.\n\nIf you decided to join in on an activity that you can participate in as an extracurricular, it might help you discover what you enjoy doing. At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.\n\nParticipating in things like clubs, sports teams, or student council gives students the opportunity to meet new people and branch out. When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others. This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people. Most activities like these use team efforts. For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills. Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers. You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities. The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy. Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are. Teammates have to cooperate with each other and work together in order to accomplish tasks. This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime. This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars .\n\nFor the reasons that I have provided as well as other ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's encouraged that more students participate in extracurricular activities. There are clearly many ways that it would help improve students' lives. It can help them with their passions, socializing with people who share interests or views, and can help students with making new experiences to assist them in the future. Many schools offer a variety of different activities to join that many of the students already find to be enjoyable. Because of the points made, if my principal ever decided that all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with her decision.",

      "Should all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity? Here are some things that might be helpful to get an answer. Some students might have other work to do from school, students may have other activities after school or outside of school, and students might become more stressed from extracurricular activities. Those are some things that might be helpful to answer if students must participate in an extracurricular activity.\n\nFirst, Students might have other work from school that they have to finish at home or after school. Students might have homework, missing work, or late assignments from school that need to be completed on their own time. If students are not able to finish a certain assignment because of an extracurricular activity, it could possibly lower the students grade. If there is an extra class in school, students will most likely have more homework at the end of the day. Students need to finish other work outside of school.\n\nSecond, Students may have other activities after school or outside of school. Some students need to stay after school to retake a test, do late or missing work, or even just get extra help from a teacher. Students also need time outside of school to collect community service hours to graduate from high school. Students may have school or non-school related classes at home that they need to take such as a tutor, church/religion classes, etc. So students may need extra time for after school or non-school related activities.\n\nFinally, students might become more stressed from another extracurricular activity. If some students have low grades, adding an extracurricular activity might overwhelm the student or stress him or her out. If students have a lot of work to complete, they might rush through everything instead of taking their time and being careful. And lastly, students might not be able to keep up with the extra class or work and their parents might keep pushing them on which will again, stress the student out. So students might become more stressed with an extracurricular activity.\n\nSo should students really have to participate in an extracurricular activity? I have come to a conclusion. I disagree because students might have other work from school to do at home, students may have other activities outside of school, and students might become more stressed. Those are the three main reasons why I disagree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity.",

      "I think that this would probably be a good idea. The reason i think this will be a good idea is because the kids have a chance to find there passion if they did not yet already. It may also give the kids a chance to stay active instead of going home and just going on there phones. They can help the school with extra stuff like help making the yearbook. This also can make a student get creative if they want to make there own after school club.\n\nThe reason kids have a chance to find there passion is because of the choices that the schools has. If the kid is athletic then the school must have all the sports as a choice and the kid can choice what he likes and if his first pick isnt his favorite he can just choose another sport until he finds the one he likes. Then once he likes it he can join a actual team and get good at it. Or if the school has a actual team for that sport he can tryout and see if he makes the team. If the student likes art they can go the a art class and either work on there art or try to get better and try new art techniques. If the student is into acting or something like that they can do drama class and act in plays and practice there acting skills.\n\nAnother reason why i think this is good is because it can keep the kids busy instead of them going home to play on there phones. The students can help the teachers with making yearbooks and if they are good enough they can also take some pictures of the clubs. They can help make events or even if they can they can try to make a fundraiser. They can help pass out material to the teachers for there clubs like paper or pencils if they need it. If they do good they can be rewarded because of there good acts.\n\nThird reason why i think this is good is because the kids can get creative. They can get creative by making there own club. And by putting the club together and also thinking of what other they can do to make other kids join. They have to get an idea on how to make the club interesting and how other kids will like it and want to join. They will have to get all the ideas together and make the club that they want to make.\n\nThese are the reasons why i think the principles choice of making a extracurricular activity is a good idea.",

Finally, what if he/she has other things they do at home? For example, they could be playing a sport that is not connected to the school, or they have their own job perhaps. I would not force a student to do any activity at school.\n\nWe should not force students at school to do activities of any kind. If you wanted a student to try a sport or a club, you should try to persuade them to try it out. For example, I'm trying to persuade you that the principal should not force students to do any activity, so the principal should try to persuade the student to try something new. Many students have lots of stress on them, such as homework, things they do at home, and maybe even bullies. Therefore, we should not add more stress to students.

      "What do you think about extracurricular activities? I believe that with amazing extracurricular activities can inspire a student to have a new hobby, or learn more about them self. On the other hand, a bad one can make a student want to quit liking the activity and do something else. My principal decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with making students participate in an extracurricular activity because of time, money, and a negative impact on everyone.\n\nThe first reason is time. Some students might not have enough time to do an extracurricular activity, which could cause the student to have stress. The teacher might lose passion for what they are teaching because of more students, who are being forced to take an extracurricular activity against their will, coming to their after school activity. If the teacher didn't get an influx of students who were forced to take his class, then the they would not have been worn out as fast, or even at all. This will, over time, slowly wear down the teacher, making the class less enjoyable for everyone. Overall, time will be a large problem with forcing students to do extracurricular activities.\n\nThe second reason is money. With more students participating, more supplies need to be bought. There might not be enough money to pay for all of the things students do in an after school activity. The students might not be able to go on trips because they cost to much. People would also be very unhappy if they have to pay for extracurricular activities that their kid was forced into. In the end, there might not be enough money to pay for all of the extracurricular activities.\n\nThe final reason is the negative impact it can have on everyone. The teachers will be very stressed because they have many students who don't care about that activity. The students will also have plenty of tension because they now have to stay at school longer, and manage another activity every day. If the students are stressed, the effect is that their grades will drop. In all, it can cause everyone to have more unneeded tension.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think making students participate in an extracurricular activity is a great idea. It could help students become more social, but it can cause more problems than it solves. It wouldn't be good if the students or teachers were unhappy because of the principal making students participate in after school activities. I believe extracurricular activities are used to show students new activities and have fun.",

      "Extracurricular Activities Shouldn't Be Forced\n\nHave you ever been forced to do something you didnt want to do? Did you do the task happily? Most people would say it was not an enjoyable experience. When talking about the topic of extracurricular activities in schools, it is definitely something that shouldn't be mandatory. These things shouldn't be forced because it will result in unhappy and resentful students. Also, students should be able to choose their hobbies, and it is frankly none of the school's business.\n\nIf we force students to participate in a list of activities that may not cater to their interests, it is only going to make unhappy students who don't actually put any effort into the thing they are being forced to do. Again, try and think back to a time when you were made to do something you didnt want to do. Something that took time away from things you actually wanted, or even needed to do. You probably didn't do that thing with a whole lot of thought and effort, or at least you didn't do it in a good mood. What's the point of forcing kids to do activities, if they are just going to do it sloppily, with zero effort. No matter how many options a school provides, there will always be kids who don't like any of them.\n\nEven though they may not like any of the options at school, whose to say they don't enjoy something outside of school. For example, what if a student is really passionate about their art? And between their chores and school work, they only get work on it about an hour of their day. Now, because they are forced to play a sport or join a club, they have absolutely no time to work on what brings them joy. This defeats the whole purpose of an extracurricular activity.\n\nEven if everyone was perfectly happy with the activity they have to do, why is it any of the schools business what people do with their free time? A school's job is to give students a safe place to learn, and to provide optional extracurricular activities. It's not a schools job to control so much of a students life, that it's even taking up time outside of school. Schools have no idea what goes on in a student's life, and it is unfair for them to assume everyone just has the time and want to do an additional thing outside of school. If a student wants to participate in something, they will. There is no need to force people to do things they dont want to do.\n\nAs you can see, the idea of making an extracurricular activity mandatory has many downsides. So many that it is obviously it is not a good idea. Making people do things they don't want to do has never turned out good. Students need the freedom to make their own choices, and the school should have nothing to do with that. No matter how many benefits, extracurricular activities should never be mandatory. ",

      "Even though a lot of school aged kids participate in after school activities, there are still a lot who don't. Some of them don't participate because theres nothing they like. There are also some kids that act like since they arent forced to do the activities then they won't ever do them, which may set them back in life. Most activities can be so fun, exciting, and interesting. In addition, there are a lot of benefits to participating in such activities, they keep you active and healthy, makes interact with others, and they can keep you busy. So if the principal was to make kids participate in one after school activity that would be a great and wonderful idea.\n\nPeople who commit to an activity of some sort can stay active and have a healthier mindset compared to a person who doesnt participate. For example, if you sign up for volleyball club after school after the principal made the announcement that you have too. You now not only have a way to exercise but also an activity to help take your mind off everything else. Even if you sign up for a learning club or activity, like a \"teaching you how to eat healthy club\", can impact your life. But you can get healthier after participating in a club or activity. If your going through a rough time then for some people a good thing would for you to do something other than mope around about it. You can develop good sportsmanship and other great qualities of a person. In other words many good influences can come off of having to do an activity.\n\nInteraction with other people is almost a given when participating in any sort of activity. Human interaction is a huge part of everything in our world. But so many people today have a hard time with it for many different reasons. So if you start at a younger age, trying to get better to interact with people, you'll get set for the rest of your life. As you interact and talk to people you learn a lot. You develop a sense of great team work and friendship. So many friendships are started when you start talking to people at these actives. You'll feel not alone and a great friend can rub off some good traits, making you a better person. In conclusion, interaction is great to do and going to these activities will help you interact with people.\n\nActivities make you stay busy, and take up your time in a good way. People who don't participate in activities will get bored easily and often. While someone who does participate in one will have a lot more to do. For example, if you participate in a spring lacrosse league and on a random Sunday you get bored you can practice lacrosse in your backyard. Another example might be if you participate in boy scouts or girl scouts you may have homework to do before your next meeting. But all a person has that doesn't participate in any activities is sitting on their bed or a couch on their phones. Then every hour theyll think to themselves how bored they are. Participating in activities gets you busy and not as bored as often.\n\nMaking kids participate in any activity, or sport is a great idea. Why? Well because great benefits come from participating in activities like keeping you active, interacting with others, and keeping you busy. Whatever you do whether its a club, sport, or just a plain activity of some sort, many opportunities can show up for you. A new passion developed can introduce a job oppritunity or hobby. Doing activities is a wonderful experience that you have to do yourself. Even if you might not completely like what youre doing at first. Who knows maybe you'll find your new passion and hobby.       ",

      "Did you know 68% of the students spend an estimated 4 hours on their phone every single day? Have your parent force you to get involve in a activity at school that you don't like? Does your parent ever said, \"You play on your phone 24/7!\" Students should get involve in at least one extracurricular activity at school because students can makes new friends, they get to experience new things that they never done before, and help students express them self to others. Students can choose up to 25 different activities to do after school like sports, art, clean the school, and a lots more different activities. This help students get involve with their school.\n\nWhen students is participating the extracurricular activities, they can make new friends. When making new friends, they are introducing them self to other students. This can improves their communication and social skills with other, good communication can also help students when they are in school or in the outside world. Additionally, they also get to a better understanding of the other students personality. For example, a student can shared their past experience with another student, discuss what they have in common, their goals, and about their friends and family.\n\nThe students get to experience new thing that they never done before. They get to find out what they enjoy, and get to know a little bit of them self. Students can express them self through activities like art, sports, and music etc. Students get to learn new skills throughout the variety of activities, and later students can shared their skills that they have learned to other students or family member. Students also get to learn about different career, subject, languages, and etc. Later, it can help them in life when they are adult.\n\nIt can help students get involve with activities. Back when there is no electronic, every kid play outside, and not a single kid hated going outside. Children were energetic, they love outdoor activities and playing with friends. Today generation is different, 10 years old boy playing video games all day, and children spending 4 hours everyday playing on their phone. If we have extracurricular activities at school, then more students would get involve in activities. Parent can also get involve by supporting their children.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many benefit when it comes to getting students involve in an extracurricular activities. Students can make new friends, they get to experience new thing, and get to express them self through the activities. Some may say if every students have to get involve in an extracurricular activities. Then, it just going to limit the time that the students get to spend with their family.

      "Imagine this, you've had a long day as a student waking up early and working hard to do well in school all day, but then you remember you have Basketball practice tonight! This excites because you have become close friends with your teammates, and it serves as a nice break from everything going on in school. Attending after school clubs and activities can give you a place where people with similar interests and hobbies all come together. After school clubs can be a safe space where you and your friends get together to do something you all enjoy, and you could make new friends along the way. Being in a club can provide a safe space, and the people there often share your interests. Activities like these can make you an all rounded person while also giving you a break from school.\n\nActivities from football to Rubiks cube club can create a safe space for the people on the team or in the club. What do I mean by \"safe space?\"\n\nA safe space is where people can share how they feel, and why they feel that way. An example could be if you're on a football team your teammates become your friends and that gives you a whole community of people who care about you. It doesn't even have to be a team it could even be a group that likes horses, but they still have something in common to bond over. Teammates also tend to build you up, and give a boost in confidence which can help you be a stronger person. Did you know that having fun with your friends and participating in the activities you enjoy can even help you get into college?\n\nI think that having students participate in an extracurricular activities could very beneficial for many different aspects of their development, such as social, emotional, and in some cases even physical. Most students are very focused on their academics and doing well to look good for college. What they might not know is colleges don't only look at grades they also look at your extracurricular s. Looking at what you did after school as well as in school helps hem see that you are able to juggle both things at once, but what they don't know is we actually enjoy it! Though it might seem like a lot especially with all of our school work, it could serve as the well deserved break we need.\n\nStudents have a lot on their plates between school, homework, and studying, sometimes it's good to take a break. What better way to relax then do something you enjoy with other people that enjoy it as well. Playing a sport after school can help you create close friends and teammates. When you think about stress reliving one of things you might think of is one of your favorite things to do with some of your friends. Well guess what, you just explained what a club is. In that portion of your day you don't have to worry about acing that test all you have to think about is swishing that three or winning that chess match.\n\nAs a whole I think that after school activities could be beneficial to students in many ways. Many students might not fit in to friend groups, but with after school clubs they know they have similarities with their peers. It's a great way to relive stress with the people you care about while doing something you care about. That's why I think that having everyone participate in a club or sport could be very beneficial for these reasons, and I think it's a great addition to our school systems.  ",

Because it relieves stress and make students look forward to school, can also be good for the school, and help student figure out what they want to do after they are done with school.\n\nI think that these school activities are good because the student can use these activities as a way to relieve stress by reading. These groups can also include counseling if the student has any problems outside or inside of school. lastly students can use these activities to learn about what they and other student want to learn, for example if the student wanted to learn photography he/she would be allowed to take pictures of flowers or animals. This is why I believe that students can relieve stress from school or from family.\n\nAnother that we should allow these activities is that they not only benefit the students but can also benefit the school.\n\nthis is because the student can make a club that every week they pick a random teacher and show her/him appreciation for helping us learn. Another thing a students can do is create posters for the school sports team. And they could help put together a school yearbook. This is how these activities will also help the school out.\n\nlastly I think that this could be very helpful for the student and allow them to explore what they want to do.

Taking care of a younger sibling, cleaning the house, helping their parents out, etc... but on the other hand if students are going home to play video games,not interacting with other people in the outside world then they should,because they can't be inside all day they need some fresh air and interact with other human beings.\n\nBut heres the thing students already have school for about 7-8 hours half of the time either listening to the teacher or taking a test so obviously they leave school tried and exhausted.\n\nMany students don't even like coming to school and still show up I think if the principal forced students to join a extracurricular activity the percentage of students skipping will increase and students might not even show up to school.\n\nWe also have to think about the teachers ,you are obviously going to need a teacher to stay with the student for whatever curricular activity they get assigned to but believe it or not teachers have a life outside of school.

Like if you did soccer you could get better with your running skills. Also if you did basketball you can use your body more witch causes you to get strong. If you do play a sport and your stress you can let it go when you play like you can shoot the basketball or you can kick the soccer ball. You also make new friends that become like a family.\n\nStudent council is fun you get to do lots of stuff with your school. Like you can make posters and hang them around your school that say ice cream social in one day. You can also make a poster about you running to be school president. If you get voted to be president you have to go to SCA meetings were you plan events to happen for the school and more.\n\nThe school yearbook is cool. Because you can take pictures of the school and students. You get to design the year book and the cover for the book. You can also take funny pictures of your friends and put them on the yearbook. It also can be a awesome memory when you get older.\n\nThats why I agree with the principal. Its a great way to make new friends and to let out stress so you can have a good time and enjoy the rest of your school year.",

It could be fun and students also can make more friends.

      "Ever been rushed around? Have had so much to do in so little time? What if you had to do a extra activity on top of that? Would your life be hectic? I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activity For example, time is something that passes all the time. Not all of the students can get a ride, adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. In all, adding extracurricular actives is a bad idea.\n\nTime. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle. Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air.\n\nbuses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figure out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride.\n\nSols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed. Making kids do something that that they don't have time to do creates a lot of stress. Students should be able to chose what they want to do. If they can handle doing extracurricular activates then they can, it shouldn't be a must. Making kids do something that isn't needed will drag them down making them now want to come to school. School should be a place of safety were kids can chose what they need to succeed in life.\n\nMaking kids do extra activities will make students have less time for home, not all kids can get a ride home from school, doing this will ad more stress. Do you have enough time?             ",

      "I think that forcing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity would cause stress in many different ways. Students already have a lot of school work to do and making them do this would be difficult. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a care provider for the family, or might have a job to do. This could also result in a lack of effort in certain things at school and at home.\n\nIf students have a lot of school work to do they could become stressed from not being able to get the work done. Students also might need to study and would not have time to do that, therefore, causing them to get a bad grade on it. This could also result in a bad grade on their report card, maybe even causing them to fail the class. If the students fail the class they will have to retake the class the next year, and if the students were already struggling with the class they would have to do it all over again causing stress in that way to. To much stress causes anxiety which can be harmful to the students self confidence, could make them sad or depressed, and many other problems.\n\nStudents might be a main provider for their family, taking care of family members, and paying for stuff the family needs. They might also be paying the bills or buying food and clothes for their family members. If students can't provide for their family they could become homeless or become sick. Might become in debt from not having someone work and make money for the family.\n\nStudents might also have a job to do and would not be able to work because they would not have time to work after school. They might also have a job so they can provide for their family or themselves. They might need the job to save up for college and schooling. If the students don't have the time to go to work they might get fired and they would not be making money to provide for family or themselves.\n\nSo in my opinion, I don't think this would be beneficial in any way to the students. This would be very stressful for the students and could also cause anxiety, even making the student become depressed if it is to stressful for them. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a main care provider for their family, and might have a job to do so they can pay for the stuff that they need to live a descent life and not be stressed. That is why I disagree with this decision.",

    ESSAY:
      "The principal at my school decided that all students need to take an extracurricular activity. How should I, as a student, feel about this? Do I agree with their decision? What is an extracurricular activity, and why did my principal make this decision? Figuring out the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, and how they impactthe students, will help me conclude how I feel about this choice.\n\nWhat are extracurricular activities? These activities are something a student could participate in to entertain or captivate them. Examples of these activities could be an art class, sports, or even a chess club. Normally, these activities are something you personally enjoy, or have a passion for. They could be in school, after school, or maybe not in school at all. One way how most schools get you to take an extracurricular activity, is by offering electives. Most schools have electives as a fun class for students, or something they enjoy learning. Another reason schools might have electives, is for the mind to grow, and find fun in certain activities. Not everyone has the same passion, so there are many options. You don't necessarily need to be good at an extracurricular activity, you just have to love, or have fun doing it.\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind the principal forcing the students to take at least one activity? Cellphones are one of the main entertainment for teenagers, them often spending many hours a day on them. Even if you enjoy using your device, it is not the type of passion most adults would choose. Making students do an extracurricular activity might positively give them a push to try new things. Taking an in or out of school activity may expand the students outlook on electives or clubs the school offers, and alluding for them to try something new. Going to these clubs or activities, offers new friendships as well. Other people that take the same activity as you, may also share the same passion. It is easier to connect with people who are similar to you. The principal would want the best for their school, and by making the students take an activity, they get new educational experiences.\n\nEven though these activities can have a positive effect on the students, there can also be negatives. Some students don't care about finding a passion, or an activity for them to do. They might just want to take a class that gives them an \"easy a\", not because it's something they would actually do for fun. Not only that, but some students just try to get into a class with their friend. That friend might be taking a class that doesn't interest the student. Taking a subject or activity that is boring or uninteresting to you, won't help you find what you like to do. When forcing the students to take an activity, while it might help them find their interests and explore new things, it might also force them to do unwanted subjects that don't please them.\n\nIn conclusion to this prompt, I agree with the decision of the principal to make all students take an extracurricular activity. Forcing the students to take an extracurricular activity, can effect them greatly. It offers them experiences, finding what they like to do best, and discovering what they are good at. It can expand their communication with other people, and overall, make new friends. These activities, depending on what they are, can be good for your health. Some students don't particularly care about finding what they like to do, and would rather just be with their friends or use their cellular device. Making these students take an extracurricular activity, can make them discover new things that they didn't know or realize before.",

    ESSAY:
      "Have you ever tried an in-school sport or club? Many students enjoy extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. But some students aren't as keen on the idea. Some think it's a waste of time, or that they're very boring. But extracurricular activities help students and schools in many different ways. I think students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity because the students will learn new skills, students will become more social, and the school will become more diverse in it's interests.\n\nThere are many skills to be learned in extracurricular activities. Depending on what activity it is, you can be taught a wide variety of talents. After school sports will teach you the basics to the game, and then maybe you'll make it to the school team for that sport. Certain clubs will teach students other games and talents. At my old school, there was a huge chess club. Some of the kids that went to it every Wednesday didn't even know how to play at first. Then they learned, as any other student could if they attended a mandatory extracurricular activity. Some clubs can even teach students the basics of just being a good student or friend, like the homework club, or the diversity club. So if every student took a mandatory extracurricular activity, everyone would learn a lot.\n\nStudents can become more social through extracurricular activities. The more students spend time with people with similar interests, the more friends they'll make. If a student was to only hangout with the same group of friends all year, he or she would never become more social, which is a good skill to have as you get older. Besides, a student might make a life long friend through an extracurricular activity. Even if a student doesn't make any new friends through extracurricular activities, they'll still have learned important communication and social skills.\n\nIf a school has a large variety of extracurricular activities that every student is attending at least one, the school will become more diverse in the student's intersests. Diversity in a school is very important for many reasons. Diversity would look good on how the rest of the county views the school. Then they might follow suite and make extracurricular activities mandatory. Another reason why diversity in a school is important because the students will impact each other and make each other want to try more activities, making a postitive cycle in which students want to partcipate in extracurricular activities, therefore benefiting them in the other ways, social and skill benefits.\n\nIn all, mandatory extracurricular activities will help our school system in plenty of ways. They'll teach students skills, make students more social, and make the school more diverse. These are just some of the reasons that schools need mandatory extracurricular activities. If you want madatory extracurricular activities at your school, start a petitionfor your principal to see. Even if that doesn't work, you can always just convince your friends and classmates to go to these extracurricular activities. This is why I believe schools should have mandatory extracurricular activities.",

      "Have you ever wondered about the benefits of students participating in an activity? Extracurricular activities can have many things to it. Some activities can be sports,yearbook designing,student council, and many other things that students can enjoy. Students would have a great time and enjoy these types of things and can find different kinds of activities they could participate in. All students should participate in an activity because it can help students find an interest,students can enjoy it, and can help keep their minds distracted from school.\n\nStudents can find different activities to find an interest/hobby. Students who don't usually participate in activities or events can find something new if they are being told to do something. Hence, making a student find an activity means that they will be searching to find one, and will lead to finding an activity they find interesting and try it out. In other words, students who doodle once in a while might find an art related activity and join. In addition, this can also help them keep an open mind and not think that all or some activities are boring or considering them as something they would never like doing. Some students might also be shy or not be involved to much in things so they might want to join an activity but are to scared to participate. This means that when students must pick an activity they can feel relieved and happy to do so.\n\nSome students can enjoy having extracurricular activities. For example, student would enjoy having activities because they can be able to do something that they enjoy instead of having class. To add to this, students that are athletic wouldn't be able to play a sport during class because it isn't allowed and would be very disruptive. Therefore, when students are allowed to choose an activity that would make them joyful and excited to join the one they connect with the most. This will also be beneficial to the class/classes that a person is in because they have already done what they wanted during their activity and it can help them focus in their classes more efficiently.\n\nThe minds of students can be distracted from school related things. Students nowadays can become stressed, and can cause their brain to be less efficient. Students can be feeling down and even depressed which is a very bad situation for students since they have lots of things piled on them. Some of these things would include projects,homework, essays, and other things that can be personal to that student. Therefore, by joining an activity students can relieve their mind off certain topics and think about other things. While in an extracurricular activity they can communicate with others and can find new friends too. In addition, they can also find an activity that can help them relax and be more calm. For example, a meditation club (activity) would be very helpful or an art activity so they can draw out their emotion/feelings.\n\nOverall, students should all participate in activities. This is because it can be appealing to some students and not so appealing to others, but this can make them find different activities/opportunities and keep them open minded. Students can also find new friendships and can be distracted from school related things which keeps their minds functioning. Extracurricular activities include lots of different things and students can enjoy it and consider participating in one or more activities. Students should all join an activity because it helps them clear their minds,some students enjoy activities, and it can help students find an interest/hobby.       ",

      "A tiresome day of school just ended, but instead of being exhausted, you are exited because your extracurricular activity is about to start. Many students go to school everyday, then leave on the bus, or walk home, until returning the next day. Because a lot of students do that, the majority of them never experience any clubs that the schools works hard to put together. By making students try out a club, they would appreciate what the school has to offer. Principals should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help students be active in the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students explore some of their interests for the future.\n\nOne reason that a school's principal should require students to have to participate in at least one activity after school is so that students become active in the school once the hours of school are done. Students who stay after school for an extracurricular activity participate in some of the schools programs. This leaves a stronger connection from the students to the school. Students can choose out of many clubs offered, and therefore feel as if they found a bigger reason to stay in school. A reason that students should be required to participate in an after school activity is so they are more active in the school.\n\nAnother reason that school principal should make kids participate in an after school club is so that kids can interact better with others. When students join a club in school, they meet new kids, ones with similar interests as them. Because of their shared interests, students can form a bond, all because of this club. Kids would also talk with the teachers running each club activity because they have more in common, like a passion for the club. A second reason that kids should have to participate in a extracurricular activity at school is so they learn to interact better with both students and teachers.\n\nLastly, if a school principal made students join an after school club, students would find and explore some of their interests. Students all have their own interests and hobbies, but to find them, one would have to look. Middle and high school students are at the perfect age to explore passions because they are getting ready to pick a major in college, so they are looking high and low for an idea of what their major will be. By joining a club at your school, students will find some club that pulls at them, inviting them to join. Also, students would have time after school to try new clubs or sports. For example, an interested student could choose to participate in the yearbook committee, or even the SCA. One last reason that students should participate in an after school club is because they can figure out some of their hobbies and passions before college.\n\nIn Conclusion, if a school principal required that all students must participate in some after school club, students would become more active around the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students expand their hobbies. A student would have a bigger purpose to stay at school if they had to join a club, giving them a stronger connection to the school. The interactions between students and teachers would be higher because they would have more in common. Finally, students would explore many different career paths for college and have a varied set of interests when participating in after school clubs. Principals, by making your students participate in an extracurricular activity, you help students in a lot of ways, so consider trying out this idea for a better future for your students. ",

      "Regarding the decision the Principal made, (\"all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity\")\n\nI agree with for the following reasons.\n\nThe first reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will improve social life for many students at our school.\n\nSocial Life is very important for kids my age because, it helps build character, (which means, it builds up personality and special traits within a certain student) creates new friendships, (always a good thing to have) and it will also make the student feel like they're a part of something.\n\nAnother reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will also help students who are dealing with personal stress. As everyone knows, a lot of kids my age suffer from different types of stress. Which are mostly caused by either depression, anxiety or even loneliness. Which means that with this new opportunity they have, their depression, anxiety, and loneliness might go down a bit as they get to interact with other students while they participate in activities they might of never even tried before.\n\nThe final reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will even help students develop time management skills. Most students at our school (that I know of) either don't have time or don't know how to fit everyday activities like school, homework, and free time in their everyday lives. So, since they have to participate in something new now, it might open up their eyes a bit and help them see how to distribute their time, which will result in them having some free time at the end of the day.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the Principal's decision to make students attend or take an extracurricular activity is a great idea because, it improves social life, lowers stress some students might have, and also helps students develop time management skills.",

      "Students should not have to participate in activities because some students might not have any interests in the activities the school provides them with. Teachers, and parents always tell me \"school comes first\", but the principal is more worried if a student makes practice on time. Now cm not saying activities are bad for students, but why does every student have to participate when they should be more worried about their future. Kids are more worried about missing their clubs than missing the notes that the teacher is providing before the test. Students should not participate in activities because some kids might not have any interests, kids should be more worried about their education than their clubs, and last but not least, kids are missing missing the notes that the teachers provide for the kids so they can pass their test.\n\nNot only does this situation affects students, but it also affects teachers and parents. Most teacher are anxious for kids because they have doubt that the students will not pass their assignments or even their class. Parents are terrified of the school calling them because their kid is not passing. Getting an education should be a kid's top priority because not one dream will be possible without an education. This situation can affect teachers and parents because they both get anxious when their kids are not passing a class, A kid's top priority should be getting an education.\n\nSchool activities are good when students are still doing good in school. activities should not be in front of education but kids will put it there when teachers are forcing students to take an extracurricular course. Most students only want to learn when they walk into school. But they are being forced to join an activity that has no relevancy. School activities are good when kids are passing, a kids education should always be first, being forced to join an activity is not right.\n\nWhen I was 13 years old in seventh grade, I was on a basketball team. When I walked into practice my coach called me in to talk about my grades and why I was failing, he didn't care about what I had to say so he cut me from the team. When I walked home my anxiety level went through the roof because I was trying to find a way to bring up my grades before the school year ends. When I told my parents what happened they started panicking and hitting and told me it was way too late to bring my grades up and I might fail. My body felt cold and I was depressed, I begged my teachers for help everyday but they told me that it still would not bring all of my grades up. Because I didn't care about my school work I had bad grades, I had anxiety, and last knowing I couldn't do nothing to bring my grades up gave me depression.\n\nStudents should not have to participate in school activities because most kids might not have interests in them. activities can affect a kids grades which can have teachers and parents worried. Kids will put their activity as their top priority when getting their education should be. Students, and the school staff should be more productive with students education. Activities are not a bad idea but forcing kids to join a extracurricular course is not right because that is not what school is about.",

You can learn to play basket ball. You can learn new subjects. You can read books and know learn interesting facts about animals. And you can learn to play a clarinet.\n\nNext, you make new friends and collaborate with different people you never knew. You can talk to young or older kids. You can ask questions to know someone better. You can hangout with new people to see what you both like to do. And you can do the same activities together .\n\nFinally, You can give your mind a break from thinking a lot by going out for a run. Walking outside in the sun. Sitting in the dark relaxing. Doing some yoga with your friends to ease your mind. And you can ride your bike outside.\n\nIn conclusion if you want to have a break, ease your mind, and relax just do and extracurricular activity and you can learn new things about food or animals, make new friends with anyone you'd like to know, and give your mind a break and do some extracurricular activity.  ",

    ESSAY:
      "Neville Longbottem transformed from a blundering idiot to the hero who destroyed Voldemort's most precious Horcurx. How did he do this? Through extracurriculars, which are also extremely important for students in the real world. I agree with my principal that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities encourage students to become more confident and brings to light their hidden qualities, while also giving them skills that will be useful throughout their whole life. Students can also discover their passion through extracurriculars, which could eventually become their life's work.\n\nExtracurricular activities instills confidence in a person and helps them show others their best qualities. If we dig deep into Neville Longbottom's school life, we discover that everything changed after he joined Dumbledore's Army, a club founded by Harry Potter to encourage the learning of Defense Against the Dark Arts. He gained confidence while he took over the club for Harry, and his true qualities of bravery and courage really shined through. Confidence is important because studies have proven that a person who is clearly confident is more respected by their peers. Possessing confidence helps a person to have good mental health as well and boosts up happiness levels by at least 80%. It is also important for a person to show others who they truly are, because hiding their true qualities creates feelings of dissatisfaction, which is overall detrimental towards a person's happiness. Helping students open up and gain confidence are just one of the several benefits that extracurriculars provide.\n\nStudents gain necessary life skills as well as confidence through extracurriculars. These life skills are often skills that can only be acquired through experience. Social skills such as leadership can definitely be acquired, and it is a coveted skill that can eventually lead to success. Just look at Neville! Proof that leaders are made, not born. Students also learn the importance of commitment as well as the skill of cooperation through extracurriculars like sports. In Quidditch, a sport that requires a ton of commitment and cooperation, Harry Potter learned to drag himself out of bed at the crack of dawn and deal with foul opponents, something which would definitely help him later on in life after he became the Head of the Auror Office. One of the most important skills a person can learn while doing an extracurricular is time management. Most self-made billionaires are masters of time management. Balancing extracurriculars with school is no simple feat, and will definitely prove to be useful in the future.\n\nOne of the best things about extracurriculars is that it will help a person find that passion which will fuel their life's work. By exploring different clubs and activities, a person can discover what it is that truly ignites fire in their soul. In a recent poll, 87% of the people who have a passion state that they are at least 95% happy about where their life is going. These are incredible numbers compared to the 97% of people who don't have a passion who state that they are less than 30% happy about where their life is going. Another poll has stated that less than an estimated 50% of people do not enjoy going to work. This is because they are not passionate about it. A person who hates their work will not be happy at all, which could result in early health complications. For students in particular, finding a passion is important because colleges are more favorable upon students who have a passion versus those who don't. Having a passion is necessary for happiness, and extracurriculars will help students find their passion.\n\nI strongly believe that extracurriculars are necessary. They help students gain confidence and a passion and teaches important life skills. Most importantly, they make students happy. Neville Longbottom, the former laughingstock of Hogwarts, transformed himself through an extracurricular. Even though Neville is fictional, he proves the importance of extracurriculars, and shows exactly why every student should participate in at least one. ",

      "Whether it's a lovable hobby of yours or an aspiration, there is always a task a person loves to carry out.\n\nMandatory extracurricular activities would be a phenomenal addition to the requirements of our school.\n\nI find this decision to be fantastic because it gives the opportunity to students to practice unknown activities and find new passions that drive them forward.\n\nIn addition, the school too would benefit from the growing skills and work put out by the students through extracurricular activities.\n\nThe first reason why I agree with our school in this decision, is because it will provide the opportunity for both me and my classmates to practice the unknown and find new passions for us to follow.\n\nThis practicing of new activities will provide us students a development in our skills.\n\nFor instance, if I were to become the head of the student council I would experience how to become a leader, the skills needed to be a leader, and how to drive my classmates to become better students.\n\nSecondly, a new drive or passion for our motivation could become discovered through the practicing of extracurricular activities.\n\nAs a result of this finding of new passion or drive, both me and my classmates would be able to figure out what it is we really aspire to be in the future to come.\n\nFinally, the experience that would be provided to us through extracurricular activities, be it sports, leadership roles, or other extracurricular activities that are available to us, would be extremely helpful in our futures.\n\nSpecifically, the work ethics that would be highly important in our future in college and even when having a job, these work ethics would be taught like wildfire in any extracurricular activity as long as participation and active engagement is exercised.\n\nThe growing passion and drive combined with the learning of skills and work ethics will surely benefit both me and my schoolmates in the future to come.\n\nAs for the second reason I support my school's decision, it is due to the fact that my classmates will not be the only to gain through the mandatory extracurricular activities rule, the growing skills along with the hard work that will be progressively demonstrated by the students will surely benefit the school in more ways than one.\n\nA major part of any school, the yearbook, could be made and designed by the people who are inside of the yearbook.\n\nSpecifically, the feelings, emotions and bonds created and felt throughout the year by myself and by my schoolmates, could only be expressed inside a yearbook through the people who made those bonds and felt those feelings.\n\nHowever, that is not the only benefit, the students of the school will also be able to make a more deep and connecting bond through both the teachers and through each other.\n\nFor instance, not every club or sports team can run by a teacher or by a student, this diverse teaching environment that will be provided will prove to show a deeper connection through my schoolmates and through their main learning environment.\n\nLastly, the improvement of attraction to our school will encourage every student to work harder and become better students along with better learners.\n\nIn depth, the increased need to work hard and utilize the skills learned through extra curricular activities will increase the grades, performance, and attentiveness of many students in class and outside of class.\n\nAll in all, this decision will not only grow myself along with my classmates, but the school in a whole.\n\nThe third and final reason why I agree and wholeheartedly support the decision of my school is because both me and my schoolmates will be able to grow mentally, and physically through the extracurricular activities.\n\nFirst off, the improvements of the number of people participating in extracurricular activities will prove beneficial for people who are in study groups.\n\nAs a result of the increased amount of people taking extracurricular activities, an increased amount of people will join study groups which will allow more sharing of knowledge through older members and newer members.\n\nSecondly, sports teams will be able to have more competition, therefore increasing the skill gap between players.\n\nMore people participating in extracurricular activities means more people trying out for sports teams which results in a higher demand to play for the team, whether it be basketball, soccer, football or other sports, the high demand will cause an increase in specific member choosing for the teams and will also cause an increase in team spots, therefore increasing the skill of the teams and creating more ways for myself and other students to play sports and grow ourselves physically through those sports.\n\nLastly, mental sports teams like chess, Sudoku, and other mental sports, will see the same increase.\n\nSpecifically an increase of mental capacity being held by our school's students, and with this increase in mental capacity needed to play games like chess, it causes an increase in schoolwork performance, and other schoolwork related items such as tests and quizzes.\n\nThe improvement in mental and physical prowess being presented will surely produce results for my schoolmates in the future to come.\n\nThe addition of mandatory extracurricular activities to our school will prove to be a promising and progressive choice.\n\nFirstly, students are going to able to practice unknown activities, find new passions, and find new friends while still growing themselves.\n\nSecondly, these growing skills and hard work that will come to be expressed by both me and my schoolmates will prove beneficial not only for us, but for the school as well.\n\nFinally, students will be able to express their mental and physical growth and increase that mental and physical growth through these extracurricular activities.\n\nI believe without a doubt that the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities is the best decision our school has ever made. ",

      "Would you like to be forced to do something you don't want to do? Of course not, students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities if they don't want to. We need to stand up for student rights, they should have the choice if they want to do activities or not. There are many reasons to support this like, the cost of essential items, students not having a way home, and most importantly most kids have to take care of younger siblings and wouldn't have time.\n\nFirstly, forcing students to do after school activities is not fair, and neither is the price to pay for it. The average cost for sports equipment if five hundred dollars, and most families can't pay that. Lets say your child decides to not do a sport and chooses to be on student council, and they have a meeting at 7:00 in the evening, someone is gonna have to take them, so there goes at least thirty dollars in gas money. So do yourself and your kids a favor and be against it.\n\nSecondly, if your child has to do an after school activity, they must get home somehow. Most parents don't get off work till six o-clock, and lets say your kids practice ends at five o-clock, or maybe even four o-clock, your child would be alone at school for more than an hour, and thats a long time. No child should have to be alone for that long and doing something they don't want to do.\n\nLastly, if your child has younger siblings and they have to take care of they after school, they wont have time for other activities. Generic_Name is a fourteen year old girl and has a three year old sister named Generic_Name . Every day she comes home and plays with her, feeds her, and gives her everything she needs while mom is at work. If Generic_Name has to stay after school for an activity, what would Generic_Name do? This was the most important reason, kids just don't have time.\n\nIn conclusion, we can all agree that students should not be forced to do after school activities, the cost is to much, they may not have a way home and they might hot have time because of younger siblings to take care of. Don't let someone force your kid to do an activity they don't want to do. Next time your at a parents meeting for your kids school and the principle asks for who is against all students being forced to do an extracurricular activity, raise your hand for the sake of you and your loving, passionate kid.    ",

I believe the principal is right in this decision. Doing these activities is an essential in these students lives. These students must start participating in extracurricular activities.\n\nMany students need to know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities. Students need to learn how to do activities, such as playing basketball. Basketball also gives a lot of exercise, which is very important for students. If students start playing games, such as basketball, they will know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities, how to work together, and how to make decisions. I believe that participating in sports such as basketball is very important to students.\n\nSome students may already do extracurricular activities, but it is important to learn how to do other activities. It is important that students learn how to do other activities, not just one activity. If students learned how to do other activities, they can learn many other things.

When Julian and other students became highschoolers, the principle wanted the students to take at least one extracurricular activity. "I guess I\'ll try out for football then," said Julian. "I will join robotics club," continued Sasha. "It\'ll be good for college credit," said Sasha. "And it\'ll be good for your health if you do any kind of sports," said Julian. Students should take at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future, students will get healthier if they join a sports team, and students will make for friends.\n\nStudents should at least take one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future. First, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then students will find the job that they want. For example, when Johnny did multiple activities in school, he knew that he wanted to be an artist because he liked to draw and he was good at it. Also, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then they will make can make lots of money. For instance, Jared wanted to be a computer programmer and make lots of money so he joined a club about computers. In conclusion, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then students will live happier life.\n\nStudents should at least take one extracurricular activity because students will get healthier if they join a sports team. First, if students get healthier then they won\'t get sick. For example, before Jerry join a sports team, he got sick a lot but after he joined a sports team he barely gets any cold. Secondly, if students get healthier then students mood changes. For instance, Tom was always sad or get mad but after he joined a sports team he got much happier. To summarize, if students get healthier then they will have a better life.\n\nStudents should at least take one extracurricular activity because students will make lots of friends. First, if students make lots of friends then students won\'t be lonely.

      "Imagian getting home from school at around five and then doing homework till like seven or eight sounds crazy right well thats what will happen if students are fourced to do an extracurricular activity. Us students simply wouldn't have time for anything else which is why I disagree with making students dp a curricular activity. Some of us students just don't have the time and are far to busy with things like getting home late, doing homework or studing, plus some kids babysit.\n\nThe first reason I disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. Parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. Plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.\n\nThe second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. If you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. This will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. Which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.\n\nThe third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin. However, with an after school activity they will not return home in time to watch said family members. And lets not forget that some students have jobs as babysitters for other people's kids.\n\nNow I understand that some people may say \"oh but it's good for young children to do an after school activity and I agree, however some students are far to busy and should not be fourced to do an after school activity its not that we're lazy or anything we'er just to busy.\n\nso in conclution i believe students should not be fourced into an extracurricular activity some of us are truely to busy for one being that we will get home late, have to much homework, and no time for friends, along with watching younger family members there is no time",

Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.\n\nExtracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to.

There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list.

They might be leaving a younger child alone, just because they have to participate in a sport or student council. There are things more important than extracurricular activities.\n\nStudents may also have an outside-of-school activity to participate in at the time. Many students choose to take lessons or sports outside of school. For example, they might have private instrument lessons, a neighborhood science club, or a sport team that isn't school-involved. These activities are just as important as school ones, and they shouldn't be forced to miss them because of requiring extracurricular clubs. The outside-of-school activities are often paid for, or require money in some way. This would lead to a loss of money for the parents, paying for lessons that the students can't attend. Students may lead busy lives, and they shouldn't have to have them taken up by even more school-required things.\n\nAnother reason school clubs shouldnt be enforced is that while buses and parent pick-up are often available at the end of the school day, it is not always the same when it's already been an hour after school. Parents also often have busy schedules, and they can't always be available to drive their student home. That is one reason why some students choose not to participate in extracurricular activities. But if students are being forced to stay after school, they might not have a ride home. This would create a problem, because then most of the school would need a bus ride home, and that would require a lot of buses and bus drivers. This would be very financially taxing for the school, so it would be better to just let students go home at the end of the school day. They have already been required to attend school for seven hours; it would not be fair to make them stay longer for something that isn't even education-related.\n\nIn summary, students have busy lives already, taken up by chores, family commitments, possible after-school jobs, schoolwork, and outside-of-school activities. They shouldn't be forced to add more things to their schedule. Extracurricular activities are meant to something fun and enjoyable in a student's free time, a choice to partake in something they find interesting. Making students attend extracurricular activities would take the fun out of it - it's supposed to a chance students can take, not another thing forced upon them. These students have lives to live, things to take care of, other time-consuming responsibilities in life that are more important than school-related ones. Let extracurricular activities remain as a choice for students.",

      "This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.\n\nMost students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.\n\nStudents tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.\n\nWe all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.\n\nPrincipals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things about doing a sport after school. You should go out and try for any sport you can and you can get better and better everyday. Nobody is holding you back from doing something you want to try doing.",

      "Why do nothing, when you can do something that will help you no and in your future?\n\nStudents should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nThe principle's choice to have every student to do an extracurricular activity is a good choice because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, Students get to meet kids that they normally wouldn't meet just in school, and students will get an example on what it is like to work with a team or group.\n\nFirst, it is good for students to participate in one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests.\n\nPeople that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.\n\nYou hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.\n\nBut, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.\n\nThe people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.\n\nFor example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.\n\nThe student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.\n\nThen eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.\n\nFinally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group.\n\nNext, it would be good for students to do an extracurricular activity because they will get to meet people that they normally wouldn't meet when you are in school.\n\nJoining a team or group will be nerve racking at first because you might not know anyone that share the same interests as you do.\n\nBut when the team/group finally gets to talking, they will have bonded so that nobody could break them apart.\n\nIt is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.\n\nIn school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.\n\nBut when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.\n\nPeople that you once thought were \"weird\", or \"annoying,\" are now your friends because you realized that they actually have the same personality that you do.\n\nFinally, it is important to do at least one extracurricular activity because students will get a taste of the real world in having to work as a team to get things done.\n\nIf students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.\n\nLearning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.\n\nSo the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.\n\nIf you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.\n\nNobody will hire you because they will look at your back round and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.\n\nNobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.\n\nFinally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.\n\nMost people don't want that, do you?\n\nIn conclusion, it would be smart for the principle to implement that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others that have their same interests, students will get to meet other students that they wouldn't normally meet in normal school time, and the students will get an example on what it is like to work as a team and to prosper at doing your work.\n\nStarting with an extracurricular activity now will not only help you now, but it will help you later in life too.        ",

      "Getting the kids to do things in school like different activities and things could help them so much and also have fun with school.\n\nCan you imagine going to school and being able to do other things besides learn? Going to school and getting to play sports during school can help with so many things in life. Going to school and playing sports like basketball, football and soccer and etc, playing those sports during school hours could be fun for the students. For the ones that love to play sports could have so much fun. Playing the sports you like can be fun but also can make you better at the things you do, it is like giving you practice outside of practicing with your team. Kids now in days need to at least do something active everyday. So therefore kids should at least be active of doing something for at least 60 minutes. So it is great to have kids participate in sports in school.\n\nKids working around schools with technology is also being active in a way. Yearbook is an example of being active and also doing activities. Doing a activity that involves technology can make sure kids can learn things with the things that they are working with in school. Most students prefer using technology anyways so it should also be fun. Technology has games and writing and reading and etc. Those things can help kids have fun but also learn things at the same time. Kids do need to read and write but they can also try to have fun with it if teachers added activities to it. Another thing that can help the students in school is to have at least at 3 min break but also use there technology at the time. These are examples on why students should have technology also as a activity during school.\n\nSchool could in vise you to do better with things in life, or become the things that you would like to be some day. Helping around at school, could help the teachers out or help the kids become something the want to become. Working with teachers and other students is a great way of participating in school. When you are participating you are also learning new things. Participating is a good way for students to be active.\n\nKids should participate in things more in school. Participating in sports is a great idea during school. However, technology is an activity that student's could work on. It is also a better way to have students learn. Also the school could always have students help out with teachers and things. This is why i think it is better to have student to participate in school with sports and different activities. ",

      "School can often be full of work piling up in the classes we don't enjoy, and stress that gets us down. What if there was a way to make school enjoyable for everyone? Extracurricular activities are teams, clubs, and any other organization run by the school. Many students like these because they have something to look forward to while in school, but not everyone always joins. I believe that students should become a part of organizations because it gives them a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and choose an activity that they enjoy.\n\nIn school activities that are outside of class, students have a chance to create bonds with new people. Teams and clubs require working together to make ideas come along, especially student council and sports. This also builds a work ethic for future jobs. Sometimes students may have trouble making friends, so being in a club makes it easy to meet people. Similar interests can also often lead to friendships. Students can also get to know a teacher who sponsors their club better, as many students rarely speak with them in class. Having a more interesting topic to discuss with teachers helps students feel more comfortable around them in class.\n\nStudents should become more involved in schools activities. As a yearbook staff member, I know that from experience. I have been able to go onto the basketball courts during pep rallies to get pictures, inform people and work with them about buying a yearbook, and learn about other class when I take pictures and collect information from them. Similarly to student government, students are able to see their hard work pay off when fellow classmates participate in spirit days and other events. With sports, athletes are able to show off their skill and passion for the game while being able to represent their school.\n\nLastly students are able to choose what they want to be a part of. Not everyone enjoys the problem solving of math or the memorization of history, but it is a requirement to take them. If students join an activity they'll enjoy, then they will have something to look forward to in school. This can also strengthen career paths. If a student is set on becoming a business leader, they can be a part of yearbook or the other organizations that run like a business. If a student is determined to be in the NFL, then they can tryout for the football team. And if they don't find a fit for them, they should be able to make a group themselves. It's important to have a variety of clubs, including students' ideas.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should require their students to join extracurriculars just as they require them to take core classes. This is because it gives students a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and be a part of something that they would enjoy.\n\nStudents shouldn't dread school, and this is one way to make it better. ",

      "I think that every student should precipitate in something at school. This is a great idea because students could get more involved in school and they can always know whats going on. They could precipitate in things like sports, clubs, and just any other extracurricular activity. This activity does not have to be any everyday thing. It could be once every week or every other day.\n\nI think every student should precipitate in a sport or a club because it lead them to learning new things. Or it could open up new opportunities for them. Many students may not like this idea because school is already enough for them and they can't handle doing a sport or be in a club. I understand that but thats why all the clubs don't have to be school related. School can be very stressful and sometimes we need a break. So having these clubs during the middle of the day could impact how a lot of students preform in school. It could be a nice way to relax and get your mind off of the work you have to do but you would still be learning in a way.\n\nThis idea could also help build relationships, make new friends, and meet new people. At school on a daily basis you probably talk to the same people. If you are in a club or in a sport you would be able to meet new people and possibly expand your friend group. If you do not want to make new friends this is a great way to get closer with your friends because you would spend more time together and you would be learning together.\n\nThis could also make students find new intrest or hobbies. These intrest could end up being something they want to study in college. This idea is a good way for students to explore new things.\n\nI know that not many students like this idea because they might think that its a waist of time or maybe they can't find a club that their intrested in. This could lead to them making their own club. So every student has a chance to be in a club or sport.\n\nThis is a great idea and I think it should be put into play. ",

Collages like good grades but you would have a stronger resume if you did sports,or worked with the student council. Most collages are looking for someone that can do a variety of activities, doing clubs and sports shows them you have what it takes. Many adults have health problems due to the fact that they are not in shape and a great extracurricular activity is sports so starting at a young age will decrease you chances of having bad health problems. Sports are also fun to do, there are different varieties to choose from like soccer basketball,and dance. Clubs and sports can help you in real life situations. When you are older and start to have jobs, situations will come up when you have to work with other people and you have to be able to know how to lead. This is why extracurricular activities will help you in the future.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people and connect with others like you. In real life situations you want to know how to be able to talk to other people and the clubs and sports you join are great practice. When you are older and you have to try to impress people it will not come off like you are nervous because you have had practice. As you grow older you will not have school to make friends so you have to learn how to talk with people so you can connect and make potential life long friends. After school clubs and activities can help you with theses types of situations.\n\nPeople might argue that some students might not have their parents to take them home or have enough money for sports. Most schools provide after school buses so you can go home. This can be a very big help for parents because they will be coming home from work around that time and knowing that their child is safe a school will take some stress off of them. After school schedule usually line up better with work than a regular school day. Money shouldnt be and issue because school do these activities for free, but if something does come up where you have to pay than you could set something up with the school that will work for you and your family.

I feel like if you sign up for something school related then its showing that you really care about the school and actually wanna help people. Helping out other teachers and staff members are good ways to help the school.\n\nSecondly, the students that are athletes in their school can also play for the school so that the teachers and the staff members can see that other people like representing their school and they feel comfortable at this school. I love playing sports but its different for some schools that dont have any sports at their school. As you get older your mindset changes and it may become easier because you know what you want to do in the future. Yearbook or student council are 2 good ways to start off your career because if you start drawing or something in the yearbook you might want to become an artist.\n\nStudents Council is a hard job for the school but is a way to make yourself organized and prepare for challenges. Other Students in your school might want to run for students council and u might not have a chance to be able to have that position. It might be a little heartbreaking if someone else gets the position and you dont because you really thought that you were the best at it.

Students might not understand if they get the job/part they're gonna get money but since its just for the school its basically like participation for other job that teachers need to do.\n\nLastly. i think that its a great idea because it give students a chance to prove the staff members and teachers that they are actually good at something. The only thing that i thikn that im good at is doing flips and stuff like that. i have a little talent of srawing but im not the best.

      "Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.\n\nHaving students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.\n\nFor example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.\n\nForced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.\n\nForced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.",

      'Nine times out of ten children will get bad habits from not adding an extracurricular activity to their schedule.\n\nCausing them to be lazy and end up with bad grades. Because when you add at least one or more extracurricular activity to your schedule, it can help you be more social, get ready for high school, and have a healthier schedule.\n\nFirst, is being more social. When getting a new activity to do at the end of the day, you will end up with other people. Meeting different people is one of the ways to clear bad social habits. Because of the fact that they are in the same activity as you, some of them might have the same interests. This can cause you to have new friends, this will help you work with others. Working with others is a good factor when you have an extracurricular, and it\'s not as hard as opinions might think. Working with others has a bad side to it because of this you could get annoyed, but you can get use to it by building tolerance .\n\nThe second reason is, that it helps you get ready for high school. To get ready for high school you are going to need a good GPA score meaning you need a high grade if not higher. Getting an extra activity can help you if not guide you to the higher GPA. Sometimes the teachers will give you extra credit activities or let you finish work that you want to get done.\n\nThe third and final reason is building a healthy schedule. Building a healthy schedule is very important because it can effect what you do now and what you will do in the future. When you add something to your schedule it will help you be able to take hard and stressful tasks. This will help you when ever you dont have a lot of people around to help.\n\nNow some people might say that it\'s "too hard","I just dont need it" , or " it takes too much time". But student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. This counter argument dose not compute with what is needed.\n\nIf adding an extra curricular activity to a students time, then it will give them social skills, lead them to high school, and help build a healthy schedule. These are the main things that students need to be successful.',

      "What ! The principle is making us participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I remember when I was forced as a kid to do that, I didnt like it at all. I disagree with this statement because, first off some students might not have time to do the extra activity's, secondly the students work hard enough as it is in school, lastly it might be the least favorite thing they do especially if they have to get forced into participating in extracurricular.\n\nWell to start, some students can't stay after, they might need to go home and babysit or watch out for their siblings. Secondly, some kids might have hours of homework that they need to do, they might not have time for extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have after school sports like baseball or football games and they would like to attend to instead of playing or doing something after hours that doesnt matter as much as students sport.\n\nNext, students work all through out the day with hardly any breaks, students want a break from having to deal with taking down notes and hearing a teacher talk for hours. Secondly, lot's of students are stressed out with grades and family problems, so why make them more stressed out by forcing them to do extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have to follow the rules and listen to teachers daily, as a result the students wont be able to learn when to make decisions for them selves if they the teachers are always telling them what to do. Students need to know when to make the decision to stay or not stay, not to be forced.\n\nLastly, some kids dont like to do extra things like playing games or sports at school because it will make them very sweaty and sticky, the principle is also forcing them to stay. An addition, since the principle is not giving the students a choice they wont like it, but If there was a option that the kids could choose then it would be more enjoyable because they can choose when they want to stay or not stay. Lastly most students like to kick back and relax and spend some time inside their home. I personally would like to be home sometimes after school and watch some movies and fall asleep if I can.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with with this statement because, it's not fair for a student to be forced into staying after to do extracurricular activities. It's also not right to be forced to stay, especially if a student had to take care of personal business like taking care of family. Principles should already know what could go on at a house, so they need to be more reasonable when it comes to adding on to a persons schedule. I still cant believe that the principle is making everyone stay and participate in at least one extracurricular activity.     ",

      "Your principal has decided that students are required to take at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree with this? I agree with this because you may want to stay interested in any of your schools activities. It is important because students want to stay active with there schools and the best way by doing that is by having something for students to experience. Schools have activities for students to do after school because they want them to stay active. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students gain responsibility, helps get students motivated, benefit their college and job application.\n\nFirst things first, having extracurricular activities can help students gain responsibility because in some cases students will be doing things that take someone with responsibility to do. For example, students that are in sports are responsible for having the appropriate shoes and clothes for their practices. This is one reason why activities, that certain schools have, are important. This will motivate students to do better and they would want to succeed in whatever they are doing. This leads me to my second reason.\n\nSecondly, it could help students get motivated to do better in school. This is important because extracurricular activities require you to have good grades and if you like one of the activities you are doing you will be motivated to do good so that you can stay in it. This can allow tons of students to be successful in school and they will try hard in school. Students might want to do certain activities that require them to have good grades and if they don't then they can't do it. This is why in order to do what you like you need to do good in school and it is very important to do good in school.\n\nLastly, extracurricular activities will benefit you when you are trying to apply for a job or just trying to get into a college of your choice. The first thing is that it may help you look good when putting whatever you did on your paper. For example, someone can put they did track and then they got an award for winning a competition, that would make their paper look good. Another example is that if you want to get a specific job and you are in a certain club were they teach you about the job could really benefit you. Like stated in the previous paragraph, it could help you take care of your grades and if you do have good grades colleges would want you. This could help you in the long run because it is important to have some experience with what job you want. Extracurricular activities can help you get to know how you feel about this and if you want to do this in the future.\n\nIn conclusion many students need to be responsible in order to keep the activity they want. Students will become motivated to do better so that they can stay in that certain activity. Students will have the experience and they will be able to get the job that they want. These reasons prove on why it is important to have extracurricular activities. This is why I agree on how students should be entitled to at least on activity because it helps students gain responsibility, helps students get students motivated, and it helps students on their job application and college application.                ",

    ESSAY:
      "Haven't you ever been so tired to listening to a subject that you seem to dislike? Wanting a break but never able to since its for a grade, well your principal has decided that you can participate in an activity you might like! You can be in a sport, work on the yearbook, or even serve in the student council! I for sure love this idea! It helps kids look forward to something that might not be as tiring and boring as the subjects of schools, run around in basketball, be creative in art class, be inspirational as you work on the yearbook, or help others and the principals being a part of the student council! It all helps in the school system and you might make a change, for example, Generic_Name, a senior in one of the highest ranks high school in Japan, was a student councilor that helped hundreds of students from doing a bad choice, grades, or just be someone to talk to. The principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity, and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.\n\nFirst, it'll make you look forward about something during your day. You might have had a bad day but then you might remember that you're going to maybe you favorite topic class and that might brighten up you day a lot more. It'll be like a small break you get other then lunch. You get to talk with your friends and maybe even your favorite teacher and learn new tactics in the class you might like. A moment class where you can relax and hang out and get grade in too! A lot of high schools, if not all, let you pick the class you wanna be in and you may have other choices too. It's a matter of your and luck but always worth it.\n\nSecond, I'll be talking about how you might socialize more. You might not get what I'm saying so I'll just straight up say it, you don't always have to be quiet unless, of course, the teacher is talking. You get to be in groups and learn from each other and depending on what your doing you will get a different pack. For example, if you were to be in a basketball team, you going to see different cons and pros on each player but you'll all will have to work with each other to accomplish you goal, if your working on the yearbook you will all have to speak to each other and work on the same task to show that sometimes two people make a better job then one. It can help you boost up your social skills and your skills with working with others even if you've never met them. Socializing its a big stage in our life that some are very afraid of and others not at all and this types of things will help you in case if you wanna make a business or be a doctor or police officer or anything, but communication is always the key that you wanna use.\n\nThirdly, this class may be the best of each year your in high school, you never know. It can be that class you'll always talk to your friends about after you graduate and have memories of. The class that brightened up your whole high school year into one of the amazing years ever, the one class that when ever you pass your old high school or have to speak about it thats the fist thing that comes into mind. That one class that cleared you mind and helped you with drama and other skills you might have needed to learn.\n\nIn conclusion, the principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity,and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school. This essay will help you understand why sometimes even having another extra class might help you in the future or at that exact moment.",

    ESSAY:
      "Can you believe that schools are now making students stay after-school to participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with schools having students participate in one extracurricular activity becasuse students need time for other activities outside of school, students need time with their families, and they need time to do their homework.\n\nMany students love coming home right when the school bell rings and having the rest of the day to do what they like. This is not the case at some schools. At my school our principal is having us participate in one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because students need time to play and practice sports such as basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer. Students also need time to hang out with their friends not just inside of school, but outside too. If a student is forced to stay after-school and there is nothing they like there than it may bother the students emotions and make them sad. If a student is sad or upset about this it may affect their participation, attendence, and effort. I do not want kids spending more time than they have to at school.\n\nThere are a ton of students who do not get to see their family at all due to school. Students need time to be with their family and socialize with them like playing a board game or having a nice conversation. Extracurricular activities may interfere with the time that kids have to spend with their families. It is very important that kids spend time with their families because it keeps their mental health well, keeps them in line, and provides comfort for them. It keeps their mental health stable because they do not worry about seeing their parents or when they will see their parents again. It keeps them in line because they have somebody to tell them what is ok and what is not ok and they have somebody to discipline them. It provides comfort for kids because they know somebody or some group of people are there for them. If students had no time to spend with their family it would most likely casue many problems for them.\n\nDid you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen.\n\nOnce again, I believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework. If time that students have for these activities gets taken away by school it may lead to something bad. If you do not agree with me please think about this again and if you do agree with me that is great because you are thinking the right way.",

      "I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.\n\nLike other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and\n\nMaybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.\n\nThere are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.\n\nIf you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",

    ESSAY:
      "Generic_Name is making the whole school participate in at least one after school sport. Although most kids arent happy with this i certainly am!\n\nI agree that you should participate in at least one activity after school because, its good exercise for you, its only one activity and its a break from watching TV all day and being on your phone.\n\nThe first reason you should do an after school activity is because, its good exercise, doing an after school sport can make you a healthy person because of the constant movement and running you do in most sports. For example sumo wrestlers usually lose up to 30,000 calories a day which is insane isnt it. You dont know how much impact a sport has on your health. Another example of sports being good exercise for you is when your constantly at practice in you do drills like running or in ice hockey when you move around back and fourth, or when in wrestling your sprawling and consistently moving. Stuff like that is the best exercise you can get these days. Or even if its not a sport it can be exercise, when your just walking you are burning calories. everything you do burns calories, even breathing.\n\nMoving on to my second reason on why you should do an after school activity is because its only one activity you have to do. Its not like its for 3 hours everyday of the year. Its not a huge birdin you have to do, its probably only like an hour and 30 mins a day or less for only like a season. But if your that lazy just do something simple and easy that dosent last long at all. Then you'll get your one activity you have to do out of the way so you can spend the rest of your year after school how you would like. The only reason i see you can't stay after school for an activity is because your family needs you everyday after school, or you have a little brother to take care of, things like that. If anything it might motivate you to do more activities after school, or join a league outside of school. All Im saying is its only a little bit of time out of your day so dont sweat it.\n\nMy Finale reason why i agree you should do at least one after school activity is because it gets you away from your phone. Instead looking on instagram and checking out snap chat. Your in the real world doing something instead of posting a selfie for the internet. While your staying after school to do an activity some lazy guy at home is just playing video games in his basement which is not helping him out, or getting the exercise he needs. Plus one day your not gonna be able to do this. Your just gonna sit in a cubical all day working on stuff and doing papers from 9 am to 5 pm. But you seriously need this because you can't be on your phone or the internet for the rest of your life.\n\nIn Conclusion i agree that we all should do one sport or activity after school because in reality its good exercise, dosent take that long and its better then looking at your phone. It wont kill you to do a sport and its not that hard. You'll be find doing an after school activity. Once the season is over for the sport your doing then your done, you've gotten it over with             ",

After school students might can't do after school do to family problems, stressed, or just don't want to do those things. I also disagree because you can't force a person who dosen't want to do something you want them to do for after school.\n\nfamily problems, a lot of student go through alot when it comes to family and just don't have the time because earthier something tradect happened or someone in there family died and thats hard on student when it comes to a family member dyeing or something bad happens. some students dont also have the time because there parent have to work and the student has to watch its brother or sister and just cant saty after school because of that. Student Can't stay after school because there parents need help around the house after school and sometimes they don't have a ride to get home or they don't have a bus to ride.\n\nAfter school a lot of student are stressed because of school work, grades and homework. At school you sometimes a lot of classes and you just get really stressed because you can't keep up with the school work. Grades are a big factor at school because without good grades you sometimes can't do the stuff you want to and the grade affects some of your stuff. homework some kids dont have the time to stay after school because they have a lot of homework and sometimes home work affects your after school activities. Stressed is one of the biggest factors of not wanting to do after school.\n\nSome students are not good at a lot of thing like sports, or clubs or they just dont like those things. Student shouldn't be forced to do something that they arent good at. sometimes they don't know what to do or they could get embarrassed in front of the kid that are good at it.

      "Did you know that one out of every four schools don't let students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that this is unfair and students should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Imagine not being able to participate in many fun skill-learning activities.\n\nWhile others believe that participating in an extracurricular activity is a waste of time, I believe that it is not.\n\nI agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as, it will make school a better place for students to be in, it will be a chance for students to make more friends or meet new people and kids will improve their skills or learn new skills.\n\nExtracurricular activities will make school a better place for students to attend. It will also encourage kids to want to go to school everyday because they will be looking forward to that one or more extracurricular activity. Many kids don't want to attend school everyday because they have so much things going on like homework, projects, tests etc. Extracurricular activities will help relief the stress many kids go through everyday, it will get their mind off all the things going on at home. When I was having a bad day at school, I always remembered that I was going to stay after school for Art club that day and that cheered me up.\n\nExtracurricular activities will also be the chance for students to make friends and meet new people. It is most likely the kids you meet in that extracurricular activity will be interesting in the same thing as you are. For example if you meet someone that likes and plays the same sport as you, you guys will have something in common. One time I attended the Spanish Culture club and I met a lot of new people that I had in common with, everyone spoke Spanish and was from South America.\n\nExtracurricular activities will improve kids skills or teach them new skills. It is good for a kid to know many skills because it will help them later in life, it doesn't hurt to learn new skills or to improve them. When I joined my school's dance team I learned a lot of new skills, for example turns, jumps, new choreography etc. I also improved how flexible I was and how far I could do my splits. By the end of the school year I learned how to properly do my splits and also some jumps. Joining the dance team really helped me in a lot of ways.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as it will make school a better environment and a better place in general, it will be a chance for students to make more friends and meet more people and kids will improve some previous skills they have or they will learn new skills. ",

      "Imagine living in a world where you had to do every single activity. I disagree that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because not everybody has time to do activities. Most kids are still in school and get homework and have to study for test and can't ever do activities.\n\nHere are some of my reasons why I disagree. Parents have to work. See not all parents have the time to be driving there kid places if they're busy at home or at work. Some parents have to work late so they can have money. Parents have a lot of responsibilities.\n\nReasons why we don't have time to do extracurricular activities is because they cost a lot of money. I used to do gymnastics when I was younger but I had to quit because my mom didn't always have the money to pay for it. I was so upset when I figured out I had to quit but I was strong because I can always do it again in the future. So sometimes our parents are struggling and we can't help but to quit. Just because our parents don't have time or money to do it now doesn't mean we can't do what we love in the future.\n\nDon't forget about us kids! We have tons of work to do at school and have to study and sometimes projects for school and its so overwhelming! If we have so much to do how could we ever to do an extracurricular activity! Doing extracurricular activities can also take up the time that you might just want to yourself. Some people don't even like doing activities which means they would but doing they're not happy doing and it's not fun to do something you don't like. These are my reasons why I don't think that all students need to do at least one extracurricular activity.",

      "You just got home from school and you relax for a while then you are going to study and do homework. But you are forced by your school to do a sport or be in the student council so now you have less time to study. I think that student should not have to do something outside of school if they don't want to like playing a sport or working on the year book.\n\nFirst being forced to work on something you don't want to do can put more stress on kids. Lets say if you are forced to play a sport and you have no athletic ability and you hate that sport with a passion it can make you miserable, you have to spend a lot of time with a sports team and that can really be bad if you don't like it. If a kid cant get his homework done because of something he is forced to do that can also put a lot of stress on kids not being able to get work done. If kids are forced to do something they hate it can really have a negative effect on them and their grades.\n\nAlso having to do other stuff outside of school that you don't want to do can take away from them having fun and playing with friends. Many kids now don't get outside as much as kids used to, and having them trapped not being able to do what they want can take away from them being kids. Having kids not being able to hang out with friends can make them not as happy and they can lack good social skills. You can see that forcing kids to do stuff they shouldn't have to do is a bad thing, this can suck for the kids if they have to do this.\n\nHowever getting kids to do other stuff can help them get off there screens. Kids are playing video games way too much these days and getting them a new activity can help get them off. Playing a sport could help kids loose weight and be more fit so they are not unhealthy. This can be good but, making a kid play a sport they don't want to do can make it so they don't try in the sport and don't give any effort because they don't like it. No one wants to play a sport they are not good at. This is why kids should not be forced to do something they don't need to do.\n\nNow you can see how making kids do something they don't need to do is bad. I think schools should not make kids do something school related that doesn't count towards grades. I hope schools don't do this and that kids can just be themselves.",

    Essay: "Students shouldn't need to participate in extracurricular. Students may need to take care of family members right after they leave school. Most students get loads of homework or assignments to finish between the week. Students may not like the after school activities, or they would rather go home. With the students responsibilities and feelings they don't need to participate in extracurricular.\n\nStudents needed at home would never be able to participate in the activities after school. Students sometimes at home need to become the parent for their younger siblings. This carries on the responsibility to feed and watch the child. The student may also need to pick up their younger siblings at the bus stop or daycare, being late to either of those would lead to a bigger problem. Having a parent come home late would push the responsibility to make sure the students sibling is put to bed at the right time. It might take hours for smaller children to sleep, this can badly effect the students sleep. The students responsibilities lead them to have no time for after school activities.\n\nWith the students work load teachers give them, they wouldn't be able to have time for extracurricular. Teachers like to assign lots of homework and assignments to students. This leads to the student spending their time doing work. Students also take the responsibility to make sure its all due before or the day of. This happens to force the student to keep their minds on school work instead of activities. After school activities would just be a handful between homework and assignments. Having a large handful can lead to stress. With the student having no time left extra curriculum would be out of the question.\n\nMost students end up having a long day at school. This can effect on how the student feels by the end of the day. Students would rather go home and relax then to do an activity right after a long day. After school activities would ruin the students motivation to do anything. Students need a break from school. The perfect time for that would be after school hours. Allowing the student to have a time for themselves would let their brain relax and letting their body refresh. Students should allow themselves to have breaks after school, this wouldn't happen if students had to do a extracurricular.\n\nIn conclusion students don't have to do a extracurricular.\n\nWith the work load and responsibilities students carry, extra curriculum would become a burden to the students. Students are more worried about the responsibilities they have and their feelings. Therefore, letting students choose what they want to do after school would be a better outcome for the students and school.",

    Essay: "I have a accomplished so much by taking extracurricular activities.\" said Generic_Name, a student at Generic_School. She believes that extracurricular activities can help out with many things in and outside of school, I agree. Students should participate in them because one can make friends, and it is better than being alone indoors all day. Although, some will say that students might get behind with their priorities.\n\nTo begin, in most activities kids will become friends with the other students there. Usually students will start by getting to know each other first. This would be by talking to each other to know who they will be with for the rest of the season/year. Next, as time goes people will start creating bonds and growing relationships with their peers. Friendships that become really close are always something special and should last forever. Once people start becoming friends they might choose to hangout and be together. This adds to the list of things to do when bored, hanging out with friends. Having and making friends is something important, extracurricular's will help with that.\n\nSecond, when participating in extracurricular activities it is better than staying inside all day. Most of the time activities are going to require you to interact with new people. Students can get to see the world and a lot of the time, learn new things. If the students' activity is a sport then they will probably be outside. This is good because they will need the fresh air at some point. Most teens nowadays are always inside playing video games. Finally, one will expand their knowledge to more that just school and home. This way their path will not be going from home to school then back. Getting to go outside has many positives that come with it, and it happens because of the activities.\n\nSome may say that if students take part in extracurricular activities they will get behind on their priorities. This may include homework, chores, and anything else. If they are so busy out and about when will they have time? If that is the case the student can choose an activity that will help them. Some options include homework clubs, or AVID. They are meant to help students out in school. It would be an opportunity to further and better themselves.\n\nStudents should take part in at least one extracurricular activity. One can make friends, and it is better than being alone and indoors. In addition students can find an activity to better their education. Extracurricular activities have helped me as well.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities after school could be really good for some people. It could teach kids to learn responsibly, help them be active, and it could really help them be more social and meet new people.\n\nStudents often lack responsibly. They often forget and misplace, not worried about homework or simply to lazy to do anything else. I think if students do extracurricular activities they would take more action and be more responsible. If a student is in the yearbook club he or she would have to be at school. This would stop skipping school and could possibly prevent bad grades. Responsibilty can also help student with there school work. They would care more about homework, study for test, and could help them be a honner roll student.\n\nStudents also need to start being active. Students need to be busy running,playing,jumping. I feel like if students be more active after school they would make exercising a habit and would not be over weight. Being active can also be help them relive stress from school. All that school work can put a lot of pressure on a kid and have them shut down mentally. Sometimes a kid needs to be a kid and just run around and play to relive stress.\n\nStudents need to start being more social. After school activities could help kids be more social and be more open. After school activates will help students raise there hand more and ask question in class because they aren't shy will feel more comfortable asking question and not worry about getting made fun of. After school activities could help students be less anti social and have more friends to talk to. Extracurricular activities can help a student by having them feel more open about talking to other adults about anything going on in or outside of school. These activities are important because kids can be very shy and not want to talk to people. This could help them talk more and be a better person emotionally.\n\nHaving Students do extracurricular activities isn't bad at all. It teaches kids how to have responsibly, keeps kids actives, and having them more involved and social. They also can learn life problems and how to solve them. They can't do that if they are anti social or lack responsibly, and not consistent or active with what they do.",

    Essay: "Imagine the many things you could do if you participated in a extracurricular activity. There is a wide variety of activities to choose from. For example; Orchestra, choir, FCCLA, FCS, and FFA. If students participated in extracurricular activities, it would help them to open their eyes to new ideas and careers. So yes, I believe that the principal should have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nFirst, you could take FCCLA of FCS. FCS stands for \"Family Consumer Science\". This course will teach you how to cook, clean, sew, and live a healthy lifestyle, you would be able to travel to places like Tennessee, Florida, Texas, and more! You can compete for awards with public speaking and meet new people. The cost for these trips may be a little expensive, but it's defiantly worth you money and time! By participating in this class, colleges may notice your skill and talents and hand a scholarship over to you.\n\nThe second activity I would recommend is FFA. FFA stands for \"Future Farmers of America\". In this course, you will learn how to take care of livestock and you will travel to nearby towns and states to compete. FFA is similar to FCCLA and FCS, but the difference is FFA covers farming, taking care of livestock, and it will teach you how to be a a farmer, while FCCLA or FCS will cover cooking, cleaning, sewing, and how to raise a family.\n\nThird, we have orchestra. Orchestra will teach you how to play either the violin, viola, cello, and/or string bass. The violin is high pitched and small, while the string bass is the complete opposite. The string bass is very large and low pitched. The cello and viola on the other hand, are a medium pitch. Violas are around the same size as the violin, and the cello is smaller than the string bass, but larger that the violin or viola. Your instrument comes with a stick with horse hair attached to it. This is called a bow. To use a bow, you have to learn the bow grip and run the bow along the strings.\n\nFinally, we have choir. Choir has four sections split into eight. Sopranos, altos, tenors, and bass. These four groups are split into two groups each. Sopranos one and two, altos one and two, tenors one and two, and bass one and two. Sopranos are the high pitched singers, while tenor and bass are lower. Tenor is a bit higher pitched that bass, but not that much. Altos are somewhere in the middle. Some singers have a wide range and can sing from bass all the way up to soprano.\n\nBy participating in any of these activities, you could possible get a scholarship. You could make a career out of the activities. You could be a famous cellist, violist, violinist, or string bass player. You could be a famous singer and go on tour with friends and family. You could pursue a career in farming and veterinary work, or you could be a famous cook like Gordon Ramsey. Extracurricular activities could open your eyes to new careers. I highly suggest entering an extracurricular course, because you could go very far. So yes, I do believe that the principal should make it a requirement to perform in an extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "SLAM!\" Generic_Name throws the door back behind her. Generic_Name's mother flies down the stairs so fast, she nearly face plants into the wall ahead. \"What's the matter honey?\" \"Ughh! My new principal just announced that all students are now required to participate in an extracurricular activity everyday after school, and i don't have any interest in that!\" Generic_Name shrieks.\"Well why is that such a bad thing?\" her mom says calmly.\"That's the point! i don't want to waste my time after school on something stupid like that. I would rather be relaxing by myself after all of my homework,\" Generic_Name answers irritably. \"Come on, you could make new friends, and might surprise yourself with new interests.\"I think it would be really good for you,\" her mom explains. \"Well I disagree,\" Generic_Name responds. \"Please would you give it a try? I see opportunity for you here. I really do,\" Her mom pushes. \"I don't need more people or friends in my life. Besides, none of the activities offered sound appealing to me at all,\" Generic_Name says. \" How about cross country? You know your dad and i used to do it when we were younger, and when you were little you always talked about how you wanted to be a runner like me when you got older. Just try it, and if you really don't like it, i'll go talk to your principal about the requirement,\" her mom offers. \"I don't know,\" Generic_Name contemplates. \"Think about all of the great opportunities and things that could come out of this!\" Generic_Name's mom says positively. \"Please?\" her mom tries one last time. Generic_Name sighs. \"I guess,\" she finally agrees. Forced extracurricular activities will benefit students in many ways, especially by motivating ones that do not typically do activities. Our school should continue to require students to participate in extracurricular activities because it provides balance in their schedules, helps them to build new friendships, and gives them the opportunity to try new things.\n\nThe first reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it provides balance in students' schedules. Balance is one thing that is very important, especially when it comes to middle and high school; colleges look at whether a student can manage an activity with all of the school work as a big factor in the admissions process. For example, My older sister applied to UVA last year; She had straight A's, a great GPA and SAT score, but got denied because she wasn't a balanced student. She claims that if she would have had a required extracurricular activity, she would have had a better high school experience because it would force her to have a little more fun, which she needed at the time.\n\nAnother example of the lack of balance is that my older brother comes home stressed and angry everyday because he's so determined about keeping his grades up in high school. His favorite sport used to be football, until his classes started getting harder and he stopped playing. However, next year he is going to step down from one of his hard classes, so he can play football again and still keep his grades up; therefore, he will regain his much needed balance again. If our school continues to require these extracurricular activities, it will prepare students for high school by showing them that they need to have a balanced school-work life to both mentally and physically succeed.\n\nThe next reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it helps students build new friendships. It is very important to have good friends throughout middle school and high school because you will need people to talk to about things, support you in situations. and even just to share laughter and spend time with that aren't your family. For example, when i started middle school my parents made me try out for track, which i really didn't want to do. After a few days, i had made so many great friends that i could not only hang out with at practice, but i also then knew them at school. To this day, i am even better friends with those people, therefore, i can't imagine what my life would be like if i hadn't tried out for track. Another example is my older brother made his closest friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, in football when he first started high school. Before that, he didn't have many good friends; football really changed his life in that way, for i never see him happier than when he is with them.\n\nThe final reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it gives students the opportunity to try new things. If you aren't required to do something, most of the time you probably won't do it unless it interests you; however if you are required to do something, you will be forced to do it no matter what, but you might surprise yourself, and find interest in that thing after all. Like mentioned previously, my parents made me try out for track when i first started middle school. At first, i wasn't the biggest fan of the idea, but i decided to give it a try; i ended up surprising myself, and Absolutely loved it. I was one of the best sprinters on my team, and found running to be a great way to release my negative energy from the day. Another example of this is my friend Generic_Name; she had no interest in sewing at all, but her mom forced her to try the sewing club at her school. Vivian ended up really enjoying it, and found it very therapeutic, as it was a great way to let out her stresses from the school day.\n\nSqueak! Generic_Name's front door's hinges make a sound as she opens it. The stench of sweat fills the kitchen as Generic_Name and her friends topple in, one after another.\"Oh my goodness you girls stink!\" Generic_Name's mom laughs and plugs her nose. \"Did you have a good run?\" She asks. \"Yes we're loving it!\" Generic_Name exclaims with a huge grin. \"I knew you would,\" her mom winks at her.\n\nBy continuing to extracurricular activities, schools will positively benefit students by providing balance in their schedules, building new friendships, and giving them the opportunity to try new things.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular's are very important for the growth of young individuals for so many reasons such as, teaching important values including teamwork, it can show students interests that they didnt know they had, and certain ones could put kids in different learning environments and make new friends.\n\nOne main reason that extracurricular's are so important is that they can teach growing children the importance of teamwork. This quality is very sought after in the professional world and being taught as early as adolescence the importance of teamwork is very impactful. Another great thing about learning how to work in a team is that it's not only taught in sports, teamwork can be taught in so many other formats like student council, yearbook club , and so much more. These extracurricular's can also teach responsibility of being on a team and how your actions affect everyone around you an how not to be individualistic.\n\nExtracurricular's can also help students find interests outside of the classroom. This give students the opportunity to find passion in subjects that aren't in school in clubs like\n\nRocketry Club, Clay Club, and Eco-Action Club . Extracurricular's give students more time to put into themselves and explore all of the possibilities that are in extracurricular's as well.\n\nExtracurricular's can give some of the more soft-spoken students an opportunity to find a community that they can socialize in. These kids can also find friends with similar interests that are in the same clubs or activities. These give certain students an opening to feel more confident and less shy during school. Extracurriculars can give a kid a small social circle that they may have not had if it not have joined an extracurricular.\n\nIn conclusion it should be mandatory to join an extracurricular because they teach values such as teamwork, they let kids explore their own interests, and give out an opportunity to make friends and be involved in a community. Extracurricular's are so important for a growing student and therefore should be mandatory.",

    Essay: "If every student were to participate is a after school activity or sport, then the school would keep getting better. If the principle were to make this rule then everyone wouldnt be as lazy. When the principle makes this rule happen, no one would be left out of anything, students would get better attitudes and grades, and students would respect the teachers and other students as well.\n\nAll students would be apart of something and will make friends eventually, therefore not one student would be sad about being left out which would boost their confidence more and more every day. Everyone gets to pick their sport or activity so that they will have fun doing it but still be working. They wouldnt have to participate in a sport or club that they dont want to but they would have to pick something. Everyone would have at least one friend because they have to work with each other all the time and they would learn to like each other. The whole school would be productive all the time and the schools systems would be improving every day.\n\nThe students would be focused on getting good grades because if they dont then they have to leave their club or team and pick a different team or club. Students would like what they do because they chose it and because they like it so much they will have better attitudes and behave better. Students wanna have good grades and be happy and this is the perfect way to make it happen. The more they experience in that club or team the happier the students are gonna be inside and outside of school. Some students are depressed and sad all the time so if we give those students people to hang out with and fun things to do we can wipe out all of the depression that those students have.\n\nIf the principle made this a rule than students would have more time to socialize with other students and their teachers. The more socializing that the students have with teachers the more the students will respect the teachers and have a better attitude in their class. If the students know and respect their teacher than they wont act up during class time and the class will be able to get more stuff done. If the students stop messing around in a teachers class than the teachers would respect them and the class could work hard to learn more everyday. The school would get better over time and soon the school will be active all the time.\n\nEveryone would be doing something so that even the kids that dont want to do anything still have to. I agree with this principle in many ways and think he is absolutely amazing and his idea is a great one. If we all work together to get the whole school to be active than i think it would be possible and they would have a great school.",

    Essay: "Imagine that you are a student, everyday you come home, do your homework, and think about how lousy your day has been, boring right? Well, having extracurricular activities after school can help with that. Extracurricular activities can help a student make friends, have fun, and put students in a positive attitude. Some students do not have many friends because they do not interact with people outside of school. When doing extracurricular activities, you are surrounded by people that like doing the same things as you. For example, I am a student that has made many friends from doing dance. Everyday, after school, I go to my dance classes and feel loved because I am surrounded by people just like me.\n\nHaving extracurricular activities after school can also put students in a better mood. People tend to be much happier when they are surrounded by people they love and are doing what they love. Even on very difficult days, doing extracurricular activities can make your day much brighter! I take dance after school everyday and no matter how difficult my day has been, dancing with my friends always puts me in a better mood.\n\nWhile I think that having extracurricular activities after school is a great idea, some might think that it could take too much time and iterefere with homework time. Well, usually, students take a long time to do their homework because they do not want to. They want to have fun! Everyone wants to have fun, nobody wants to be stuck at a desk doing homework. Extracurricular activities are fun and do not take up a massive amount of time. Students will still have time to do their homework after having some fun doing what they love. Some people might say that some extracurricular activities, like sports, can cause injuries. Although you might get hurt, it does not happen very often. Not all extracurricular activities give the oppritunities to get hurt, but they all give the oppritunity to have fun!\n\nExtracurricular activities after school can be very beneficial to ones life by making them live a happier life. You can also make many friends that have the same interests like you. Activities after school can allow you to have fun. Extracurricular activities can really change someones life for the better.",

    Essay: "I think it would be fair to say that more than half of students at my school participate in some type extracurricular. Most schools offer a wide variety of extracurriculars to participate in from soccer to theater, or govenment, there are hobbies for whatever you would like to try! I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps kids find what they are interested in, a positive social activity, and supports a healthier lifestyle.\n\nOne major reason I think all students should participate in an extracurricular is because it can ignite new interests. If you don't encourage kids to participate in extracurricular, how will they know what they are interested in? You never know if you like something until you try it.\n\nPeople who go into the NFL and NBA don't just show up one day and start playing, they found their intrest when they were younger and stuck with it. Many of our past presidents were involved with their school student government in high school. Students can get scholarship opportunities if they are very talented at their hobby. If they are enjoy that activity a lot, and are committed to what they are doing, it could possibly become their future career.\n\nAnother reason all kids should participate in an extracurricular is because it's a good social activity. You take a look around my school you will notice kids who do sports or take part in band are more talkative and friendly. Joining a club or sport team would help students socialize with people they usually wouldn't talk to otherwise. Many kids bond with their peers they do that extracurricular with, making more friends. It can give people a sense of belonging.\n\nLastly, extracurriculars support a healthier lifestyles. Having to do a sport or club would get more kids off their phones and outside their house, away from their beloved XBOX. With child obesity on the rise in the United States, it would'nt be a bad idea to have more kids exercise, whether its their body or mind! This would encourage more people to be involved in their school community, making kids probably like school more. It has been proven that the people who usually have better grades are the one who take part in a sport or club.\n\nOverall, everyone should join an extracurricular because of all of the benefits. I think all students should participate in a some type of extracurricular or some type of hobby, because it can ignite new interests in things kids might have thought they did'nt even like, create new friendships with people in their school community, and support a positive lifestyle!",

Or if a student chooses football, they will be in better physical shape and have to keep up their grades too stay on the team. And all athletes stay in shape through the season which feels good, so they will do anything too keep in shape so they will keep their grades up, sleep better, and be better in general while maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nOr if a student does yearbook they will learn how to use a camera and what goes into making the yearbook.

    Essay: "Hi, my name is Generic_Name. I go to Generic_School. are principal Generic_Name, decided that all the students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think Generic_Name is very wrong ,and I strongly disagree with his choice. He should of made the students vote first. Weather if they want to do that or not. I have a lot of reasons why Generic_Name shouldnt of done that.\n\nSo like I already said, I disagree with Generic_Name's choice. Here is why I disagree. My first reason is that not all the students have time during school or after school for these class's. They already have like 5 other class's, and almost all the class's have homework. When will the students get time to do the homework they have from their original class,s. They may finish the homework, but the students don't have as many breaks during the day as they had. Those extracurricular activities aren't gonna make the students better at school or smarter. So they kind of don't have a good reason to give them to us. Thats why I think Generic_Name should let the students vote cause I would vote no cause I disagree, and I don't like the idea.\n\nMore reasons are that some of these extracurricular actives are after school, and a lot of the parents work. Which means you would not have a ride back home. Most of the students don't like school. For example you have me I hate going to school. I count the hours, but thats ok. Whats not ok is when I have to go to school after school. That just to me is not fair. Cause thats like my whole day gone in school, and thats not my opinion alone a lot of other people have that opinion too.\n\nThis is the most important reason to me and everyone on this earth. When will the students have time to relax, and sit down alone to do the things and the hobbies they love. If they do those extracurricular activities they won't have the time to do any of this stuff. The good mind is in the good body. If the students don't take care of them selves. They can get depressed or get the corona virus and die. I would not like any of that to happen to me or any one in this world. School work is hard, and more work equals stress, and stress equals high blood pressure, and thats not good for children. Thats why I disagree.\n\nAnother reason is that all this work, stress, and time will take you away from the stuff you love doing. You won't see your friends as often. You won't get time to do your hobbies or talents. You won't see your parents if they go to work late in the day, and come in the morning. You will have to work on weekends and on holidays that would suck. That is why I disagree with Generic_Name.\n\nI think Generic_Name should think this threw again. He should ask some of his coworkers, and teachers. He should have a pole or a survey. Because if a lot of people disagree like me they don't have to do the extracurricular activities. Or he can ask the kids what activity they like, and then he can have class's the students would like. For example I like cooking if he would have a cooking class. I would do the extracurricular activity. Maybe not every day but that is something I enjoy doing at home. Maybe I would enjoy it at school who knows. All I know now is that I disagree with the class's that Generic_Name has now and the timing. Thats why I disagree.\n\n.....................................................................................THE END.................................................................................",

    Essay: "I agree with the principal that the students should participate in an after school activity. I believe that it could be a good way for the students to find new friends with the same interests as them. Students could also try to find clubs that catch their interest if they didn't have a club that they wanted to join, and maybe they would enjoy that club. Staying after school for clubs could get kids off of there phones, and help them to stay active. Another reason why staying after could be beneficial is that the students get an opportunity to do the things they like, that they may not have the opportunity to do at school or at home.\n\nStudents could find other students in that club with the same interests as them, and they could become friends. The students will make new friends because they all have at least one thing in common with each other. If they were to hang out more, then they could start to find out that they have a lot more in common. Making new friends at that activity will make the students want to go back to that activity so they can see their friends again. This would go perfectly with the idea that the principal had. The student wants to go to something that the principal is telling them that they have to go to. This gives the principal what they want, and it gives the students what they want.\n\nGoing to the activity will make kids use their free time constructively. Usually when students get home from school, they use their time being on their phone or playing video games. When they go to an after school activity, they use some of their free time constructively. If the student went to the sports club, then they would get more physical exercise. If the student does yearbook, then they get to learn about different activities going on throughout the school. If the student participates in the student council, then that student gets to help the community through service projects. All of those clubs provide better use of the students time, rather than just sitting at home doing nothing. If the students actually enjoy cutting back on devices, then would try to manage their time so they are staying away from screens and doing something that is stimulative.\n\nSometimes none of the activities catch the eyes of a student. Maybe if they were forced to choose one activity, they would find a passion in that activity that they didn't know that they had. Some students don't have enough hobbies, if they even have any at all. Making them choose an activity could possibly interest them in whatever they chose, and they would start to take up that activity as a hobby. Now that the student has a hobby, that student will most likely spend time doing that hobby instead of doing the other activities that keep the student from being productive. The student will now think that if he gives something new a try, they will enjoy whatever it the new activity is. Now he will want to do other new activities that exercise either his body or his mind. Soon his free time will be filled with the hobbies that are good for him and not the time wasting ones.\n\nIf the student already enjoys one of the activities provided, then it gives the student an opportunity to participate in that activity. Sometimes students just can't find time in their busy schedules to do the things that they enjoy. Staying after school would be the perfect time for that student to do the activity that they want to do. Maybe the student wasn't selected for the yearbook elective in school, but because there is a yearbook activity after school; that student can now do yearbook like she wanted to. Some parents can't afford for their child to do certain activities like play a sport. If there was an opportunity for the students to stay after to do a sport for free, they would take it. The student gets to do something that they have always wanted to do, but that their parents could never afford. Many students just want to do something that they enjoy with their free time, and after school is the perfect time to do it.\n\nThe principal making the kids stay after for an activity will most likely result in a positive outcome for the students. Whether it results in new friendships, trying new things, or just being able to do something that the student loves. The principal should make every student participate in and after school activity, because it is beneficial to them. That is why I agree with the principal and his decision to make every kid do an after school activity.",

For example, sitting at our desks all day will increase the risk of health problems, and also decrease the blood flow to your brain. Therefore, this change to get us in extracurricular activities during the day, in my opinion, is great.\n\nYou might be doing yearbook year book or serving on the student council and thinking, how is the benefiting us? Well, let me tell you, both of these activities will make us communicate, be vocal, be involved, and be up and moving. Some of the classes we take do not get us up and working with other people/communicating. So, either way you put it, in some way, serving on student council or doing year book will have a positive affect. This may even benefit us with social skills more so than the classroom.\n\nSports, these activities will be very good for our health. Having us active, not sitiing down all day, and having a bit of fun is a win. If you would think about the difference compared to sitting at our desks all day, this activity decreases the risk of health issues and increases the blood flow to your brain. The comparrison of health between sitting and being active are polar opposites. Every sport that they have to offer us is benefiting us in our health, but might also lead us to building new relationships with other students.\n\nThis is a wonderful change, thanks to our principal. If you look at the facts this will have a positive impact on not only our school, but us students. If you really take this into consideration, it makes total sense why they did this for our school. Half of the students aren't very involved in the classroom, so, maybe this will let them have fun, while also being involved.",

    Essay: "Everyone at school should and will participate on a school sports team. You may not be the most athletic or social person. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't participate. Because you never know you may find something you really like. Here is why everyone should participate in a school sport.\n\nSome people choose not to participate or try out for a school sport. This is only hurting them. When someone chooses not to participate in a school offered sport such as football, softball, volleyball, or lacrosse. They take a risk of not getting the physical activity they need. If they don't get the exercise they need they may become very unhealthy. They are even also missing out on opportunity's to make new friends.\n\nWhen students choose not to participate in sports. They may be missing out on some valuable life long friendships. From personal experience I know that if I didn't start playing softball I wouldn't have some of the friendships and memories I have today. With the people I have become friends with i'm sure that we will stay friends, through high school and even college as we grow throughout softball careers together. So if you think you aren't good enough still tryout because you never know you could make friendships that last a lifetime.\n\nSchool sports are again a good idea for everyone. Parents may think that it is not a good idea to play sports because it is dangerous. Even though they think this kids will have fun and make memories. Parents also might say \"not every single kid wants to play sports!\" That may be true but another sport they can play if they don't enjoy high contact, fast pace sports is competitive chess. Or they could make a new club where they can incorporate stuff they like and make up a new sport. That they would enjoy more than the other sports.\n\nWith the options an evidence given, it is a good idea to play sports. Because, it makes kids more physically active, creates new friendships, and allows kids to have the fun they can't have during class. A principal should make kids play sports because it can be fun and educational at the same time. And lastly it teaches them how to be good people and shows them valuable life skills and lessons.",

    Essay: "Oh man I didn't make the soccer team!\", yelled Generic_Name. \"At least there are football tryouts next week\", replied Generic_Name. \"Im so glad that there are many extracurricular activities that our school provides!\", said Generic_Name. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it could be a good use of time for them, they can create a passion for themselves, and they could help out the school.\n\nA reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because it could be a good use of time for them. After school, many students play video games or take a nap which is not a good use of precious time. Instead, students could use their time wisely by staying active and helping out others. For example, Generic_Name plays video game all day long after school. If Generic_Name had something to do after school, it would keep away from video games and he could be having fun a different way.\n\nAnother reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities at school is because they can create a passion for themselves in doing so. Many students don't know what they want their career to be in the future. Being involved in extracurricular activities can help them find a passion for themselves. For example, Generic_Name signed up for art club for the first time. After his first few days, Generic_Name grew a passion for drawing and painting.\n\nBefore, Generic_Name wasn't sure about what he wanted to do when he grows up. Now, he wants to be a graphic designer and take his drawing skills to another level.\n\nThe last reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they could be helping out the school. Kids can join programs that help out teachers and students. Programs like student council and more can make others jobs easier. For example, Generic_Name ran for student body president and won. Now, he can help out students and teachers when by decisions and changes for the school.\n\n\" I'm glad I got over my video game addiction\", said Generic_Name. \"Now I can focus on my future\".\n\nIn conclusion, Students should participate in extracurricular activities because it could be a good use of time for them, they can create a passion for themselves, and they could help out the school.",

    Essay: "If your principal was asking you if you think it's a good idea that students must participate in at least one school activity, what would you say, do you agree or disagree. While reading this pay attention to the details that will be added about why students should or shouldn't must participate in school activities.\n\nOne reason students should be forced to take at least one school activity is some students after school just go home immediately to watch television or use their phones,the reason this is a problem is because that isn't good for their heath kids, need at least a couple of hours in the sun the reason being is the sun provided Vitamin D. Another reason is students eye sight could get worse by them looking at a screen all day. The final reason is some students are addicted to using their phones, did you know that phones can cause cancer? by students doing a sport or club this can limit screen time.\n\nThe next reason why students should be forced in doing a school activity is it can make people widen their circle of friendship, the reason being is when you talk to someone constantly you guys are immediately going to become friends. Another reason is students can become less depressed if they suffer from depression, the reason being is students who are depressed are founded to be more happy when their around more people they can talk to if they were alone it'll get worse which is why they should do an after school activity. The final reason is that students grades may improve reason being is, they might meet someone who can help them with their school work or even help them study. Another reason is students can start to feel motivated because in order to do a school activity you have to get good grades, so maybe they might start feeling motivated to have good grades. The final reason is students may feel more motivated to do their work because, after they go home they'll do their work so they can have a better grade.\n\nThe final reason why students should be forced do doing a school activity is it can make students more motivated the reason being is, while students are doing an activity they are going to feel motivated to win or have their team win. Another reason is students will start to do things more organized or on time the reason being is, now that they have some motivation from doing an activity when it comes to doing this they are supposed to do, they might do it better. The final reason is students who don't have respect can most likely gain it the reason being is, when being motivated your behavior changes really quickly, so people who have no respect might gain it.\n\nAnd that was why I believe that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because, It'll keep them off their phones, it'll make students open their circle wider, and it'll make students more motivated.\n\nSome people may think otherwise, for example some students may think it's a bad idea for students to have to participate in at least one school activity while others think it's a great idea.\n\nThe reason some people might not think it's a good idea for students to have to participate in one school activity is some students might be stressed if their forced to do an activity they don't want to do, the reason being is, some people have social anxiety this means when put around people they tend to get uncomfortable, nervous, and maybe even cry because they have no clue what to say.",

    Essay: "Many people don't take after school activities and some do that is just the type of person and they desicion of that person or their parents. I don't take an after school activity because I feel like it would stress me out, and when I get stressed out I get angry extremely fast. My parents don't make me do because they think it is for the best to let me choose that desicion but some parents do make them because they feel it's for the best. So I disagree with this statement because some students may have busy a life, some may be having family issues happening at the certain moment, and others may not be interested in a certain activity.\n\nOne thing is some kids may have busy lives and they can't make the time for it. An example is if a kid has a after school job and they have to work on certain days. It means they would either need to get special permission from the school or would they have to take kids away from their job. Another example is if the kid has a lot of homework and they have a certain amount of time. They would have to stay up all night in order to finish the homework because of an after school activity.\n\nSome of the students may be going through some family issues at that current moment. What about if a student's parents are going through a divorce. That student could have continuous panic attacks or having mood swings the would probably get in them trouble. Also what if one of the student's relatives are sick or got into an accident. The relative would probably want the student there a lot because it could be getting worse or they could be close to death, the student wouldn't have time to see them.\n\nMy last example is if the student is not interested in a certain extracurricular. They student may get signed up for a sport he doesn't like but is required to take. He probably wouldn't try his best because he doesn't find the sport interesting or just doesn't really care. Also if the student attempted to sign up for something but doesn't make it, so they sign him up something he doesn't like. If a student would attempted to sign up for track but doesn't make it he might get signed up for volleyball but he doesn't enjoy volleyball.\n\nSo in conclusion I don't think it is fair to force students and their peers to do after school activities and it should be students or his parents choice. If a kid doesn't want to take a extracurricular it is their right not to and if they do, they choose an extracurricular. I believe it is the students choice to choose, or the parents of that certain student and not the school. So I disagree with it because some students could have a busy life like having a job, they could have family issues like a divorce, and theirs may not be interested in a certain activity like football or baseball.",

    Essay: "Imagine you are a student at a school which offers you two extracurricular activities, a gaming club and a football club. You don't like either since you are not good at sports and you don't know how to play video games, but you are forced to do one anyway! The principal of a school has decided that all students have to at least do one extracurricular activity. I however, disagree with forcing students to do an extracurricular activity because it can be a distraction from their homework and study, not fun, and in some cases can be stressful.\n\nThe first reason why I disagree with forcing a student to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can be a distraction from their work as an average student has to spend an extra 1-2 hours of their sleep doing their homework and projects due to other activities such as chores. With enough jobs to cut hours out of their sleep, it does not make any sense to expect students to have to do extra work since most extracurricular activities want or expect work of its session. It just doesn't make any sense for a student who doesn't want to join an extracurricular activity to be forced to join and do extra work there.\n\nThe next reason to why I disagree with forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can be not fun nor entertaining to a student. Why a student doesn't join an extracurricular activity in the first place is because he/she does not find the activities fun. Being force to participate in an activity a student doesn't find fun to replace it with the time they could be doing something they enjoy just doesn't sound right as students should be able to enjoy what they like doing the most. The principal when proposing the idea of forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity must only have assumed that all students find the extracurricular activities provided is interesting although there are many who do not find the activities interesting.\n\nThe final reason why I disagree with forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can cause stress. Extracurricular activities can add more work to a student's life which can therefore, invoke stress. Many students already have problems trying to establish their sleep schedule because of an overwhelming amount of school work. With an extracurricular activity that demands a lot of attention, it will be definitely stressful. The principal has yet again clearly not take a moment of forethought when deciding about this course of action, especially for the students working hard to meet grade requirements and studying for exams and Sols.\n\nI disagree with forcing students to do an extracurricular activity because it can be a distraction from their homework and study, not fun, and in some cases can be stressful. Extracurricular activities can be a distraction from a student's already homework-filled schedule, take over time for students to be doing what they find fun, and be very stressful especially for those already doing an activity that is very time consuming. There is indeed a lot of students who finds extracurricular activities fun and easy but the voices of the people who finds extracurricular activities hard and time consuming is important and should be heard too, therefore, we shouldn't force students who don't want to participate in extracurricular activities to do so.",

    Essay: "Do you think all students should at least participate in one extracurrcalum? Well in my op ion I say they should not because it's not for everybody.\n\nMy first reason I have for saying no is it's not for everybody. What I mean by that is not everyone can talk with other people that well. For example a introvert is a person who doesn't really talk or handout with other people. Another example is that if they were bullied and are scared to talk to people who have a bulky built.\n\nMy second reason I have is there isn't always a club out there for you. What I'm trying to say by that is there are people out there who just don't like none of the activities. For example one of the activities is sports and most of the boys want to play football or basketball, but I really don't like neither. I also don't like The other sports they have to offer. Anyways out of all of the clubs they have to offer I don't really like any of them.\n\nMy last reason I have is why can't we make our own clubs? I know there are some schools out there who won't let their students make their own club. For example say if I wanted to make a video game club, but they won't allow me to make one. Because I said I wanted to play fighting games. So basically What I'm saying is I find it unfair that us students can't make a club.\n\nNow to conclude my paper that had my three reasons which are: Clubs are not for everyone, There is not always a club for the students, and Not being able to make their own clubs.",

    Essay: "I do agree with this decision for many reasons. Extracurricular activities can be very benefiting in many different ways. First, off you can meet new people and make new friends. Second, you can learn a new sport/skill from this activity depending on what you are doing. Also depending on what you decide to do your skill could benfit others like the yearbook. There are many reasons that extracurricular activities can help.\n\nExtracurricular activities can introduce to new people. You can meet new people and get to know other people a little bit more. There are many types of people and if you want to meet other people who do the same things you can pick that activity. For example if you wanted to meet people who play basketball you can try out for the basketball team or if you wanted to meet people who like music you can join the band. There are also many ways to get to know familiar faces a little better. You are doing something you like while meeting people that you could like or already do. Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people.\n\nYou could learn a new sport/skill from what you do. For example you have always been really in to computers but you decide you like soccer you could join the soccer team. You would be learning how to play a sport you have never tried before. You could also want to join the photography club you would be able to learn how to use a camera and download photos to a computer. There is always something new to learn and you should always go the extra mile to learn something. Extracurricular activities are a great way to learn.\n\nYou could also benifit others from what you are doing for example student council helps everybody because of all the things that they do for the school itself. Any club or team can help in a way like winning a championship brings pride to the school or the yearbook club who put together all of the best memories throughout the year. Everyone can help in their own way no matter how big or small each club helps others.\n\nEvery club in benefiticial and should be used to help others and learn. They help you meet new people and try new things. Everything can help you and that is why I do agree with his decisions for everyone to join a club because of all the benefits it can have for you. Some people don't like to be that social but they should still join an extracurricular activity because in the long run it will help them out a lot. Extracurricular activies are going to help everyone in one way or another.",

    Essay: "Have you ever played a sport for your school? Well as an experienced athlete I know it can be hard to balance the never ending piles of homework when you have to spend most of your time training. And it's not just sports that have that effect it's all extracurricular activities. When a student joins on of these activities they don't know what they are signing up for, because they are really just an extra load of stress onto the crippled backs of today's students. Forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities is really just extra stress, helping you get bad grades, and all together effecting you negatively.\n\nFirst off, Sports, Sports are probably the most important thing in many of students lives. Sports are getting them scholarships pushing them to get better grades, and become healthier people overall. But when a student joins a sports team he is taking precious time away from his day where he could be doing his homework, spending time with his family, or even babysitting his little sister so his mom dosen't have to pay extra money for a babysitter. Sports are an extracurricular activity and so is yearbook club, and robotics club, but they all have the same effect on students, a negative one. When one person has to deal with all of this at once their output is stress, lots of stress. Stressed students get bad grades even when they're striving to get them up, stressed students make bad decisions, and stressed student are more grumpy, and snappy. All of these different emotions piled up causes students to try and find a different output, and that's where drugs, and alcohol come in, they strike when a student is weak. But thats not the only negative side effect of out of school activities because they really do destroy your grades\n\nThen again grades are some of the most important things in any one person's life. grades make or break people. grades determine whether or not you get the job or you don't get the job, they give you life but they can also take it away. When a student get good grades joy floods into their life, their parents are proud, their teachers are proud, you auto-matically become glowing like a star. But when bad grades come along they contribute to stress, and usually your parents are not proud, neither are your teachers. Bad grades send students plummeting to rock bottom. Extracurricular activities are a leading cause in bad grades because they provide less time to study, do homework, sleep, and get the better grade. And when it comes to after school clubs they might not seem big but they are, they take away even more time and money because of all the competitions and contributions you have to make to those type of things. After school activities are a roller coaster that only goes up once in a blue moon. They effect you negatively, and it's not right to force them upon students.\n\nWhen it comes to grades, sports, or any club the effect's that they have on students is clear, not a good one. Forcing student to participate in something that effects them negatively is wrong, and should never happen, ever. Being in the negative can be good sometimes though, for example when you have negative twenty-one fires burning your house ( No fires burning your house) or when your electricity bill is a negative (that means they owe you money). But in most cases being in the negative is NOT a good thing, like extracurricular activities. Negatives and after school activities don't mix because all that happens is more negative things. A negative plus a negative is not a positive, its more negatives. So in the end you have to understand that extracurricular activities are wrong, and not OK.\n\nFinally, Forcing students to participate in after school activities bring stress into their lives, worsens their grades, and puts them really low on a negative scale. Extracurricular activities are a bad idea for any dedicated student to participate in, yet here we are still getting sign ups every day. So if you could take home anything in your brain that you just learned I would like you to ask yourself: should we even have after school activities.",

    Essay: "Why students should participate in extracurricular activities. You should consider doing a extracurricular activity. Because participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help you branch out, make new friends, and you can have access to Currier interests. These are very important because they can help you have a overall better experience at school. Many enjoy doing these activities and find it very relaxing to get away from school for a while and try something new.\n\nFirstly, you can branch out and make new friends, when participating in extracurricular activities. When you are doing something you enjoy, you can find people with the same interests as yourself. Many people like myself love doing extracurricular actives. For example I love doing FFA, I've met so many great people along the way. This organization has taught me so much, such as life lessons, leadership skills, and team building strategies.\n\nSecondly, this is a great way for students to interact with others. In addition they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. Sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. Working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the the yearbook. Finally the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. This club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams.\n\nThirdly, Currier pathways options, this is a bonus to participating in at least one extracurricular activity. You may decide to try something new and really enjoy it. In the future this could possibly be a Currier interest for you. For example if you choose yearbook, a Currier option for you could be photography. There are many options out there, but this one extracurricular activity you choose, could help you make that decision. On the other hand I would think about choosing one of these activities.\n\nIn conclusion, you should consider doing at least one extracurricular activity. You can branch out,interact with others, and have access to Currier interests. These activities can really make you more skilled at what you love to do. Therefore I encourage you to do at least one extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "Should students have to participate in extracurricular activities? I say that students should participate in an activity because they can make new friends, find a new hobby they enjoy, and maybe find what career they might like. First, students could go outside of their friend group and make new friends to spend their time with. Second, kids can become more active and healthy. Lastly, students can find what career they might be interested in. In conclusion, after school activities are good for students to grow in friendship, mentality, and physicality.\n\nFirst, students could go outside of their friend group and make new friends to spend their time with. Some kids may not have friends in their activity, so giving them a friend could make them feel good. Making new friends can also help become more social and friendly. For example, I played volleyball this season and I made friends with people who use to scare me, now they have taught me to be a better player and friend. All in all, students can make new friends that can encourage and boost each other up during their activity.\n\nSecond, kids can become more active and healthy from extracurricular activities. Students are able to play sports and stay in shape. For example, I used to be very unhealthy, but then I joined volleyball and I became very athletic and healthy. Although, you do not have to play a sport, you could join a choir to work on your breathing and your lungs. After school activities keep students in a very healthy state.\n\nLastly, students can find what career they might be interested in from doing an extracurricular activity. If students have a passion there might be an activity where they can learn more about it. Likewise, I want to be in the medical field, so I am volunteering at my local hospital. Similarly, if you want to do online design you might join the yearbook staff. Extracurricular activities can help students find what they really want to pursue in life.\n\nIn conclusion, after school activities are good for students to grow in friendship, mentality, and physicality. While doing activities students become better people and peers. Finally, students are able to step out of their comfort zone and do something they may have never known they liked.",

    Essay: "The principal has decided that all students must do an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be fun or can just give you something to do. However, I do not agree with this. The principal might have a good reason for doing this, but students should be able to do whatever classes they want to do and not do whatever they don't want to do, and some extracurricular activities could clog a busy student's life with unnecessary work.\n\nStudents should be able to choose whatever they want to do. Some might want to take extracurricular activities, and some might not want to. One of the most important things about work, school, or any type of job is that it doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're happy doing it. Happiness has a large effect on anyone's life. It is very important that a student is happy with whatever they are doing, because if they do not like what class they are participating in, they might not want to do their work, which could lead to bad grades, which could lead to anxiety or depression. Then, they might not be able to focus on their other classes, and that means more bad grades. There are many other paths that not enjoying your work can go down, too.\n\nSome children's lives could be very busy. Let's say that a child is living in a family that does not have much money, so they need to stay home and babysit their siblings. An extracurricular activity such as a sport can lead to the child not being home until even later that day, which means their parents have to stay home to watch their other children, meaning the parents can not work to make more money. This could lead to very difficult financial issues for the child's family. In fact, this happens too often in real life. This could happen in real life to a student at the school, and they might not even be able to afford school anymore.\n\nThe principal should most definitely consider their decision. Extracurricular activity can affect student's lives in many different ways, but some of effects can be not at all beneficial to a student. Unnecessary work can affect emotional, physical, and mental health in more ways than you can imagine. If students want to do an extracurricular activity, they can, and if they don't want to, they shouldn't have to. Not being able to make your own decision can not only affect what you want, but also what you need.",

What would you pick and would agree or disagree with them? I would agree because doing a extracurricular activity can have many benefits like, being fun, helping the community, and it can even be good for you.\n\nThe first reason I think everyone should do a extracurricular activity is because it is fun. Doing a activity that you are good can be a lot of fun, but you can also pick one you do not know and learn something new. You can do the same activities as your friends and spend time together and have a lot of fun.\n\nOne more reason you should do a extracurricular activity is that you can help the community while do your activity. There are many ways you can help the community like joining a clean up club, volunteering at the library, or just giving any type of service. It is a great way to give back to the community. It can also be very good for nature and the environment.\n\nLastly, doing a extracurricular activity can be good for you. It can help balance out school work and gives you something more fun to do. It can also be good in a physical way if you are playing a sport or something involving exercise. Overall it will make you energetic and a lot happier.\n\nIn conclusion I think everyone should be required to do a extracurricular activity because it has many benefits. Being fun, helping the community, and being good for you are only a few of them. There a many more benefits of doing extracurricular activities, and I think everyone should do them.",

    Essay: "I strongly disagree with the principal, The principal should not make it so that u must participate in extracurricular activity after school. Being forced to participate in after school activities can cause lack of sleep, Affects students after life, And it would have a bad reputation on the school.\n\nThe first reason, Why students should no be forced in doing after school activities is that it can cause lack of sleep. Therefore students will not be able to perform well in school. For example students need 7-8 hours of sleep everyday and that is scientifically proven. So forcing students in doing after school activities can cause them to go to sleep later than usual. Having lack of sleep can cause a student in having a different attitude towards school.\n\nThe second reason, On why students should not be force on doing after school activities is that it can also, Affect a students after life. Therefore students will have to cut off some activities they would want to do or, Have to do after school. For instance, Student may have to do chorus or, Watch there little sister at home and, Even hang out with friends after school. So being forced to do after school activities will just cancel all of that. Being forced to do after school activities can affects somebody after life.\n\nFinally, The last reason on why students should not be forced on doing after school activities, Is that it would have a bad reputation on the school. Therefore students will have a negative feeling on the school, Which will also cause the school to never get new students. For example students could have bad behavior, And on that note the school will eventually get bad ratings.\n\nTo sum it all up, I talked about the three main reason on why the principal should not force students to participate in any extracurricular activities after school. Because it can cause lack of sleep, Affects a students after life , And can have a bad reputation on the school. And that is why the principle should not force students to participate in after school activities.",

    Essay: "Have you ever had that feeling when you get home, finish your homework, maybe hangout with some friends and your still bored? Well, an extracurricular activity like a sport or a club would really be great for you! I think that every student should do at least one extracurricular activity because, it would help students make new friends, and students could earn scholarships while learning on the way.\n\nDoing something else around the community would really get yourself out there to make new friends and open up new opportunities. This would help you later in life when you might need to make friends in college, and those friends would help you out before your exams and other times like that. All in all this is just something everybody should do. It doesn't pack your schedule too much because, if your day is already too chaotic then you probably already are doing an extracurricular activity and you don't need to do another.\n\nThis doesn't just help make new friends, trying out new clubs and sports would help you find your thing. This \"thing\" could be what you really like doing or what your good at doing. Its not only for a great time, but you could earn scholarships to the hardest colleges to attend. You could earn one by simply being good at any sport, or even through a club!\n\nMost clubs through the school are free so I would sign up now to find new friends, open new opportunities, and even earn a scholarship to a college. Next time you turn down a club, I want you to think again and sign up.",

    Essay: "Do you think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I think students should participate in one after school activity. I agree because after school activities keep students busy, they can be fun, and they can help students later on in life.\n\nFirst , I agree because the activties keep students busy. Instead of the students going home to play, they can stay after school and participate in different activites. Students will continue to learn about new things. In school, I decided to do band after school. I enjoy that activity and I learned how to play new instruments.\n\nNext , I agree because the activities can be fun for students. The activites can be fun because the students can participate in different clubs like art, cooking, gardening, boys and girls, and drama. Students can also have time to talk and laugh with their friends. My friend and I have been going to the boys and girls club. We have a lot of fun and weÃÂ´ve met new people.\n\nFinally , I agree because the activities can help the students later on in life. Some students may want to participate in different sports like football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and volleyball. And other activities like cheer, step, band, and dance.

    Essay: "Trophies, medals, awards and praise, our school could use a lot more of these and you could too! Why not make your contribution by joining an extracurricular activity? Coming home to too much free time and nothing to do is something we all suffer from, so is simply not being included. Our students should listen to our principal and solve this lonely epidemic of too much free time while doing what you're good at and what you love by joining a club, sport or any extracurricular activity! Students should all participate in an extracurricular because they have the opportunity to feel included in a team, be acknowledged for their talents, and improve their skills.\n\nFeeling included isn't something anyone can just make happen, and the cliche \"just talk to people\" isn't very helpful in a school with thousands of other students. It is hard for one to put themselves out there. However, when in an extracurricular, students are surrounded by people who chose to be there because they have the same interests as them. When there are people who are just like you by your side, you can easily find a common interest to bond over rather than talking about nothing to someone who you know nothing about, a stranger. Students have peers within that group or club also need them for that extracurricular because no matter what they are apart of, an extracurricular makes a team! No one can be excluded in a team, because every member works together and relies on each other. Being apart of a club or sport means students are surrounded by their friends who all are doing what they love together, almost like a family.\n\nImagine, a student is out there and doing what they love most and what they are best at, once they're finished, students are rewarded with trophies, medals, and praise! it's almost everyone's fantasy, so make it reality! students should not daydream about what their life could be and what they want it be when it is a very real possibility to make happen! Our students deserve to be acknowledged for their amazing talents. There is always something for everyone. Join an extracurricular activity to get credit where credit is due.\n\nNo one can ever be perfect and there is always something one can improve of themselves. However, no one may never be able to improve and build their skills if a situation does not present itself for one to realize what their weakness is. It is hard to meet such an opportunity if we never take risks and \"play it safe\". An extracurricular will help us improve those weaknesses and even our strong ones to be the best that we can be by presenting us with a new challenge everyday. Those skills may be related to our athletic or mental capabilities, but no matter what activity students may be apart of, it is certain one can improve their teamwork and cooperation skills. students are also working with their peers who may have more experience and can help guide them through obstacles and can share their wisdom on how to improve their skills.\n\nTaking risks and trying something new is always scary. However, there will always be an excuse not to do something and we will never know what we are missing out on if we never even try. we could surprise ourselves and others by going beyond our expectations and being able to tell the story of the time we tried something new. Students may just be alone and feeling excluded with the push needed to encourage them to get them outside and into the open. An extracurricular will always lead students to new opportunities like being apart of a team, building skills with those around them, and being praised and rewarded for what they are best at.",

    Essay: "Any extracurricular activity can help any child in one way or another. The principal at my school is mandating every student to participate in an extra curricular activity, do I agree with this decision? I firmly agree with the decision the principal made because it can help keep students out of trouble, teach them how to manage their time and stress, and it can help improve social skills and help children make friends.\n\nThe first reason this was a good decision is that it can teach students how to manage their time and stress. If they had a mandatory homework it could discipline them and teach them to do their homework and when to do their homework. My example would be that doing wrestling and football has taught me that I should do my homework as soon as possible and to work hard at school so I can have less work to do at home. If students learned how to manage their time and stress then that can prepare them for high school, college, and even the real world!\n\nNext, another reason the principal made a good decision is that it can help improve teamwork, communication, and can help students find out their hobbies and what they like to do. If students find out what they would like to do like a sport or any other activity, that activity could stick with them their entire life. If there's somebody that isn't very active or social and this activity teaches them how to talk to other people and they make friends then they can just have a more happy, and fulfilled life in general. In my experience I made a bunch of friends from sports and extra curricular activities that I will have for a long time.\n\nAfter that, the third reason I agree with the principals decision is that it can help keep kids out of trouble. If students have activities that take up a lot of their time then there will be less time for them to get involved with things that will get them in trouble and more time for them to find out what they enjoy doing. If there are more students that are doing what they enjoy rather than getting into trouble, with less students getting into trouble the school and community could benefit from the principals decision.\n\nI believe that the principal made a good decision because it can help keep kids out of trouble, help them find friends, and teach them how to manage their time and stress.",

    Essay: "The principle does not make the decision whether the students should be in extracurricular activities or not. I disagree with this decision because not every student has the time to be in an extracurricular activity at school. The students either have too much homework or they do not have the time to do it. Some students have other activities going on that take place outside of school. Students would have to make time in order to be on the student council, sport team, and on the yearbook team. The students could be spending more time focusing on the activity then on actual school work. It takes time out of homework and practice if you are in band, orchestra, and chorus.\n\nIt also adds stress to the students. The kids may not want to do some of the activities that the school has. They may want to spend time with their families instead. The principle should respect students decisions on what they want to do with their time in the day. The students have the ultimate choice when it comes to school activities. The students come up with the time schedules that they want to follow not what the school wants them to do. They could want the kids to stay longer then they normally would and that could cause a problem. Some students have a life outside of school that they want to have but some activities get in the way of that.\n\nThe students make their own decisions based on what they want to do with their school lives. Principles and teachers do not get to tell students what they think students should do with our time. Schools staff should respect kids wishes about school activities, and students should just have to focus on passing their classes. School activities do look good on collage applications, but depending on what grade students are in they should be focusing more on school, and not what school activities they should do. The principle should not be worrying about whether or not students are doing activities or not. Kids just want to get their homework or classwork done with and not have to worry about the schools activities.\n\nThe students are trying their best to get good grades in school, but they should not have to stress even more they they have already by doing an activity. The kids are just wanting to get by in life. Some of the school activities do not help them in the real world when they are trying to get a job that they are good at. Kids do not want to have to do an activity that they are not good at or that they do not like. Many kids may want to hag out with their family and not be at an activity. They could start getting bad grades because of it. The students want to get done with their homework, and not have to keep adding work to that stack. The more activities that a student is in the more stress, and work they have to worry about.\n\nStudents don't want to be in an activity that they do not want to be in that does not use their full potential. They don not want to waste their time on an activity that they do not like. Kids may feel like they do not have the time to do what they love. The kids might not feel like they have the time they need to do their homework. The activities give the kids even more homework then they had before joining the activity. They could start getting bad scores on test because they are not doing the homework in time before that class. They might want to get out of the club due to stress or they do not like it anymore. Students do not want to spend all of their time inside of the school.\n\nStudents should have the choice to do an activity or not, and that is their choice not the principles or the schools. If their friends are doing an activity great, but it is what their friends wants to do not what the students has or wants to do. The students gets to decide what to do, and not what their friends or principle wants the to do at school. It is their choice on what they can and can not do with their free time. The students are already stressed enough, and especially when they are getting ready for a big test. Students want to get good grades on test like a state assessment. Band, orchestra, and chorus sometimes have trips that they take, and assessments. It is up not to the schools staff, but to the students themselves on what they want to do.\n\nSchool activities get in the way of studying for the said big test. They might not want to go to the activity anymore if it does get in the way of studying for any test that the students might have. It is truly up to the students to decide what to do both in and out of school. The students could try and stop going, and finally leave the activity. The students main priority is to pass the grade that they are in with good grades. The principle of the school should be focusing more on the students grades and mental health, then school activities. Students should be given the choice on whether they want to do an activity or not. The activities they take should not matter to them or to the principle but the classes, and grades they take or get should matter to them. Schools should respect the students wishes, and not force them to do something they do not want to do.\n\nThe principle should not worry about the extracurricular activities at the school. In my opinion the school should allow the kids to do what they want to do with their activities in school. Students can decide for themselves, and figure out what they think is necessary and proper at their time in school. The schools main priority is to get the students passed and moved on to their next level in learning. Students should just focus on the next level of learning, and not what activities to do at school. No matter what the kids just need to focus on the work at hand, and not what activities they should try out to see which one is the best one for them. Some students do school activities, and others do activities or clubs outside of school. Some students are bad at sports. Others are shy, and some are socially awkward around others besides their friends.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities play a large part in any student's middle school career. Whether it is sports, music, yearbook, or art club, extracurricular activities help shape students, as well as their futures. I feel that all middle school students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nExtracurricular activities give students opportunities to make friends and develop their social skills. Clubs and activities expose students to new people they may have never met otherwise. Meeting different people and working together with them helps prepare middle schoolers for life in the real world. In life after middle school you meet new people almost every day. Being able to work well with people, whether it is on a science project or a business pitch, is an essential life skill. Having experience with these skills will help students go far in life.\n\nBeing part of an community is a very large part of students well being. When students feel as thought they have no one to be there for them, their mental health can be affected. Extracurricular activities make students feel like they are part of a community. Another way extracurricular activities benefit students is that they can improve performance in school. It has been proven that attendance rates are higher in students who participate in extracurricular activities then in student who do not. Being a part of a team and community helps motivate students to do their best and strive for success.\n\nWhen student join extracurricular activities they not only work with new people, but they also get a chance to learn more about themselves. An example of this is one of my personal experiences. I had just started middle school. Theatre was one of the electives I was taking. I really enjoyed the class so I decided I would sign up for the upcoming fall play. I new I did not want to be on stage, so I signed up to help with costumes. In the time leading up to the play, I learned so much about myself. I realized how much I loved technical theatre and fashion design. I also learned that you can be a part of theatre without being on stage. Looking back, I am so grateful that I decided to participate in the play. I learned things about myself that I never would have if I had not.\n\nThat is why I believe that extracurricular activities should be participated in by all middle school students.\n\nExtracurricular activities provide students a chance to develop social skills and prepare for adulthood while also helping student learn more about themselves. Student get to become a part of a community and expand their knowledge of the world in which we live.",

    Essay: "Every year lots of students take an extracurricular activities, sports, clubs, or student council are some just to name a few, but should the school forced you to take one? There are many reason why a student can or can't participate in an extracurricular activity. Sometimes things like home life, after school life, or maybe even school life can affect your ability to take an extracurricular activity.\n\nFor some students home life is just as or maybe even more important then their school life. Some students have the responsibly to look after their siblings. Not all parents can afford to send their kids to a daycare everyday, so they let the oldest sibling look after then well they are at work. A student could also be tasked with taking care of the house. Thing like mowing the lawn, cooking meals for the family, and clean up the house afterward can take a long time not leaving enough time for something like a sport. Last a student could be in a position where they can't drive to or from school everyday. When a student rides a bus to school somethings that is their only option and they can't depend on their parents to drive them to soccer practice. From taking care of sibling, cleaning the house, or even transportation problems students can have many reasons why they have to chose home life over an extracurricular activity.\n\nWhen the last bell rings and you are home it's a student own time to do want you need, or want to do and some of that is more important than an extracurricular activity. Some students once they're old enough to get a job to earn money. With school taking so much time already that doesn't leave that much time to work, so once school is over students spend the rest of their day working at these jobs and not at a school club. School may be a student main way of learning things, but that doesn't mean it's the only. Many student take after school classes to learn something they're interested in that sometimes might not be able to learn at the school, so instead of an extracurricular activity at the school they go take their own classes somewhere else. Last students could just be hanging out with friends. Students have lives outside of school they hang out with their friends playing games, going to the mall, or just watching a movie these are all things school do outside of school other than just go home. Students live their own lives once the last bell rings like having a job, taking diffevent classes, or just hanging out at a mall, all things that an extracurricular activity would prevent.\n\nA student main job in to get good grades in school, so when they need to get something done in school that becomes more important then an extracurricular activity. Everyday after school the first time you have to do is finish all your home work. Sometimes students can get a lot of homework to do, so they don't stay after school to do an extracurricular activity instead they go home to finish homework. If a student is struggling in school they might need to get some help. School is harder to some students than others, so these sometimes these students need to get help from a firend or teacher and that may make it so a student is not be able to attend the student council meeting that day. Last it could also be that a student needs to stay home to do a project, with or without a group, projects take a long time to do. Research, testing, and making the project can take all time and sometimes that mean that you can't particpate in an extracurricular activity. School is the most important piece of a kid's life and if having an extracurricular activity is affecting their school life in a negative way then the students shouldn't be particapting in an extracurricular activity.\n\nI think that students shouldn't be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Student have lives outside of school that could get effected by having to participate in these activities. Students that have to watch siblings, clean, or cook from their family couldn't do so if they are forced to kick a ball in a game of soccer. Kids with tight jobs and after school classes would have to find a way reschedule thier activity that they already little time to do. Last student will have to find a way to keep up their education well also taking something like football. There are just too many students that use their time after school to keep up their lives that it's not a wise choice to force students to take an extracurricular activity.",

Extracurricular activites are often before or after school or even on the weekends. Some examples of extracurricular actiivities are sports or clubs. I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things.\n\nThe first reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help boost students mental health. Studies have shown that more excercise is benefical and improves overall mood. Extracurricular activitives,especially sports, have a physical component that gives students the chance to be active. Being active has shown in studies that it improves sleep cycles and overall improves mental health. Being in a extracurricular activity can help boost mental health.\n\nThe second reason why it would be benefifical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help improve social skills. Making friends doesn't come easy to everyone and joining an activity can give students the chance to meet new people. Joining an extra activity can introduce you to many people who over time, will get to know you and possibly want to become friends. Being a part of an extracurricular activity can help you meet new people and can make it eaiser to make friends or just talk to people in general. An extracurricular activity can help imporve social skills.\n\nThe third reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can give students the chance to try new things. All activites have a main focus like soccer or art club, but all activites have a little thing they do that is unique. Having the chance to be part of a club is a new thing in itself and you should take advantage of that try a new thing. Being in an extracirricular activity can give students the chance to try new things.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things.

    Essay: "How would you feel if you had to do an extracurricular activity even if you were already busy during the school week? Our principle has decided that it is mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some kids might like the idea of playing a sport or joining yearbook club because they have a lot of free time or they like participating in extracurricular activities. But others might feel like they are already to busy after school with homework taking up their free time or they might want to use their free time to relax and reset themselves for the next day. If students were required to do at least one extracurricular activity then some students would not have time to do homework, students might not be passionate about participating in any of the extracurricular activities offered, and they would not be able to take a break from the stressful school atmosphere.\n\nExtracurricular activities can take up a lot of time which means less time for students to do homework. Sports can be two to four hours long everyday after school making it so students are forced to do their homework late in the night when they really should be in bed asleep preparing their brains for the next day of work. Some extracurricular activities like band require students to participate in concerts which end late at night giving students no time to do their homework at all. Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.\n\nExtracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.\n\nSome students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.\n\nExtracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time. Extracurricular activities should be optional because students need to be able to have time for homework, students may not like any of the extracurricular's offered, and they need to be able to take a break from the school atmosphere.",

    Essay: "Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.\n\nTo begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class\n\nOn the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.\n\nEven though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.\n\nIn conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape. I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.",

    Essay: "I think students should not have to participate because they might not enjoy it,they could fail, or they have other things to do. It's not fair to make a student do something like this it could cause hurt rather then help. The choice should be up to the student. The principal may have his reasons but there are string reason against this rule as well.\n\nThey might not enjoy it,Not everyone is good at something. The simple fact of the matter is not everyone gets along with teachers and students alike. That could cause a person to dislike extracurricular Charles Darwin once said \"Do what you love and love what you do\". In my opinion if you dont love or even like something it makes it harder and harder to get up and go put energy into doing it. So in the end enjoying the extracurricular activity is a big part.\n\nThey could fail lets say everyone else got spots in there favorite group or club and you where stuck with something like yearbook design. You know when it comes to being creative you are the worst but your barely passing school now so you give it a shot. Your teacher tells you that you are failing yearbook design and it could affect your graduating but if you hadnt taken the class you woundn't be making A's but you would be passing. All of this over one class that you wouldnt be taking if it wasnt for your principal and his new rule. I think that there are better ways for students to get involved not because they are forced but because they want to.\n\nThey could also have other things to do like how a lot of kids now a days have siblings. Which could be a huge problem if they have to join extracurricular. Parents work and older siblings have to watch there younger ones but meetings for this club that the student had to join is after school. How should the student get there or why should they have to worry about this anyway. Its harder for some people to do things like that its just a fact.\n\nIn conclusion there are more cons to making students get involved in extracurricular then there are pros. Everyone life is different and expecting every students to be able to do something like this could cause them to dislike things,fail or even skip it all together due to other things. In my opinion its a bad idea the time could be spend better. The average student goes to school 8 hours a shouldnt that be enough.",

    Essay: "Required extracurriculars\n\nHave you ever considered joining an after school club? How about a sport? Or maybe even student council? There are many different activities to choose from that all have unique benefits. Participating in an extracurricular activity would be very beneficial because most colleges like when you have school related activities, they give you something to do, and it's an opportunity to make new friends.\n\nWhen completing a college application, they'll want to know more about you. One way to show them that you're well rounded is joining clubs. It displays that you have a variety of interests. As a result, the probability of you being accepted into a certain college is increased. The more activities the better.\n\nNot only are extracurriculars beneficial for college, but they also give you something to do. Would you rather be sitting in your bedroom and staring at the wall or learning new skills and having fun? If you're more interested in the arts, then you could join theater or drama club. If you prefer being active and competitive, then you could join a sport. No matter what you decide on, you'll enjoy yourself and learn simultaneously.\n\nExtracurriculars are an excellent opportunity to create new friendships and learn more communication skills. Everyone has one common interest and that brings people together. Finding a friend or two is very likely. By making new friends, your communication skills will certainly improve.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurriculars are very beneficial because they impress colleges, provide entertainment, and create long lasting friendships. So think about joining theater, chess club, or playing basketball.\n\nConsider all of the benefits you may receive.",

    Essay: "If my school princible decided to include activities to the school that students have to participate in one of them I would disagree. I would disagree because some children might not have the energy or time to do all of these activities and should mostly focus on school work. I would also disagree on this claim because how much money that the school has to use to make these activities happen for every student.\n\nTo support my first reason some children have to keep having to learn because if they do sports they would have less time to do anything school related and have to give up some quality sleep time and use some of it up on doing school work so it ruins their sleep schedule. To help my second claim on how this will affect the schools buget and to help support my second claim on how the school shouldn't make students do activites and cut school buget is how much the school has to spend. For an example if there was a cooking activity the school will have to use some of the school money to buy all the ingrdients to make all the food that the children need to do. For my final example the student council some of the children might not like to do it and they will think that it is boring and really wouldn't want to do it and will stop doing it.\n\nAs I stated if my school princible would suggest something as doing activites in school I would disagree due to the fact that it would be either long and waste students time that they could have used to finish up school work that would have been more important than what they were usally doing.

    Essay: "Have you ever been forced to do an extra curricular activity? Many students participate in extra curricular activities because they enjoy it or they want to spend time with their friends. Others want to spend time doing homework or just have a free schedule and relax. Some schools think that students should have the choice if they want to do an extra curricular activity while other schools think that there should be a requirement for the amount of extra curricular activities a student does. Students should not be forced to do extra curricular activities because they would not be able to have full control of their before and after school schedules, they would become more stressed out from having to do things they don't like, and they would get better at the things they already enjoy.\n\nStudents should be able to have full control of their before and after school schedule because doing well in school is the main thing expected from them. They should be able to have fun and be able to enjoy the things that they like and while they still can. Besides, schools should just be a place to learn and make friends, not a place that controls your entire life. Many schools are trying to control their students too much and not give them any freedom even though most students are responsible enough to do things on their own.\n\nStudents would become more stressed out from having extra curricular activities that they might not want to do. If a student genuinely wanted to do an extra curricular activity, then you wouldn't have to force them to do it. But if a student did not want to do an extra curricular activity, forcing them to do so would stress them out a lot. Maybe a student is struggling with homework, making them do an extra curricular activity would give them less time to do homework and would also make them do something that they don't like.\n\nIf a student really enjoys what they already do, they would get better at it if they did not have extra curricular activities conflicting with it. Many students do things that most people would not consider as an extra curricular activity, things like skateboarding, making videos or songs, and playing video games. Some people have natural talent or just really like these kinds of activities and should not have to do other things just because schools don't understand them and do not consider them as extra curricular activities.\n\nWith students not being able to control their schedules, becoming more stressed, and not getting better at the things they enjoy, it is clear that not forcing students to do extra curricular activities is more beneficial than trying to control their lives outside of school. My school does not force me to extra curricular activities and I am thankful for that, even though I still do a lot of activities such as hockey, lacrosse, French horn, and swimming. Without having to do extra curricular activities I feel like a have more freedom and if I really wanted to, I could quit everything to focus on skateboarding, which I really enjoy.",

    Essay: "My knees started to tremble as Generic_School's principle started to walk on stage, getting ready to make an announcement. A few minutes go by, but it seems like he talked for hours! He thinks everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity if they aren't already in one. He has lots of good points that support his decision but I overall think it's nonsense. Students have several things they could be doing instead of putting their time into an extracurricular activity.\n\nFirst, students already have enough homework. Our school has seven periods, of which six of the seven we have homework in. We are in school for seven hours and then we are expected to go home and complete another two hours of homework. Adding an extracurricular class to our school day will just add another piece of homework we will need to complete later that night. If the class doesn't involve giving out homework, it will still take precious time from students, where as students could be using that time for more important things, like studying for core classes to better their future.\n\nAnother reason I disagree is because students have more important things to focus on. Students have four core classes throughout the day that they get tested on at the end of the year and they need all of the time they can get to study and learn. Adding an extracurricular class to the school day gives them less time to study. A extracurricular class will make students focus on that individual class when they should be focusing on more important classes that will benefit them in the future. Imagine having three tests all in one day. You would much rather be studying for those tests instead of participating in a mandatory extracurricular class that wouldn't even benefit you in the future. The extracurricular class will take time away from students that need to study and it could result in a horrible test grade.\n\nLastly, students and teachers need time to relax. School can be stressful, especially if there are tons of tests coming up. Instead of adding a extracurricular class, add a relaxation class. School can put lots of pressure on students and even teachers. If you add an extracurricular class, someone has to teach it so that gives teachers more to do as well. Adding a relaxation period could benefit the teachers and the students by letting them relax and just enjoy being there. Students don't always get to go home and relax after school. They might have lots of chores to do and lots of homework! Teachers don't have it easy either. Teachers have to stay after school and grade papers, tests, and plan out activities the next day which could leave them tired and stressed. Everyone needs time to relax, even if it isn't a long period of time. Everyone is so focused on their responsibilities in life when they just need time to sit back and relax.\n\nThere are so many reasons why I disagree with my principle when he says everyone has to be in an extracurricular activity. I think that students should be able to choose if they would like to participate or not. Some students might handle it well as others might not. Everyone has something going on in their life to decide whether or not they can participate in an extracurricular activity and not everyone has the time for it. The principle has many great points on why students should participate in an extracurricular activity, but at the end of the day, I have a totally different opinion on it.",

    Essay: "The position of the principal is good because some people in schools just wake up go to school and go home right after that, but with this decision this way the students can interact with other people and learn about different things going on in the world and can give them a chance to try something new. This decision will help with creating friendships with different people but also will be able to make some student get out of their comfort zone and interact with people. Some people may not have liked this decision because maybe they go home and hang out with their neighbor but they go to a different school and that school didnt want that disition so they are bored have nobody to play with.\n\nIts a good decision because it gets people out of their houses and more than just the average day of school. It help with that by getting people to stay after school and gives them a chance to hand out with their friends or to make new friends. It also just plain lets them have fun with a club. Getting to get out of the house also can also help if your parents are always just nagging you to get out of the house and do something this way you can go to a creative club for almost any subject like SGA, art club,strategy games club,video games club, or even stay after for a sport. you have so many disitions to choose from all you need to do is get out of your comfort zone and try something new.\n\nAnother great thing about the principals disition is that it gives everyone something new to do and to get you out of your comfort zone. This some what helps people get out of their comfort zone and do something with their lives. It also helps with someone who doesnt have the time to go to a sport after school this helps. It would definitely help with my family because my little brother has his own sports after school so if I stay after school then I can pick him up and not have to wait bored at home for another two hours just to get him. If you are trying to make some new friends but still hang out with your friends then you can just get a teeacher and some of your friends and create your own club so that other people if they are fasinated by your club then they can join your club.\n\nWith the principals desision I still think that with it that the school will be able to know their students and try to get them to get out of their homes and also get them to try something new. By this desision the students will be more well rounded and be able to do someting that they love to do. They will also be able to hang out with their school friends and not have to worry about trying to get home from each others houses where at the school they have buses to get home.",

    Essay: "Do you agree or disagree with the principles decision for every student to have a mandatory extracurricular activity? I agree with having a mandatory extracurricular activity because they are a way to make new friends and they give an opportunity to find something that you like to do. I play soccer which has benefited me hugely in both of these ways and I am very glad that I play.\n\nMy first reason for agreeing with the principle's decision is that extracurricular activities can be a way to make new friends and strengthen existing friendships. I play soccer and I have made many friends from my team that I would have never met if I was not on the team. These friendships are also better than most friendships because I have something big in common with these people and that is having a deep passion for playing soccer. I often go to a field near my house with my friends from my team and from school who play soccer so we can improve our shooting and our jukes to get past other players. My team and I always communicate with each other or we would have no chance to win. I play as a striker so my job is to receive a pass, get past the enemy defenders, and score.\n\nEvery player has an important role and needs to work their hardest and work together or else we won't win. Having to work together so much for the common goal of trying to win creates a bond between my team and I. Without soccer I would not have made some of my greatest friends. Because of the principles decision to have a mandatory extracurricular activity, many other people can make new friendships with the people in their activity, which I think is a great for everyone.\n\nMy second reason for agreeing with the principle's decision is that they can be an opportunity to find something you enjoy doing. I am so glad that I decided to play soccer because it has given me an immeasurable amount of joy and has helped raise my self confidence. In third grade when I got home from school I was always bored and had nothing to do, so I asked my dad to sign me up for soccer. Once I started soccer I loved it and constantly wanted to improve and be better than my peers. Once the whistle blows to signal the start of the game, I get a rush of adrenaline and energy that is indescribable. I always try my hardest in the game because when I do well I feel good about myself. I am not a very confident person, so when someone compliments me about how I am fast, or how I have a good jukes to get past other players it really makes me happy and more confident in myself. These compliments make me enjoy soccer even more and also sometimes the happiness lasts into the next school day. Without soccer I would probably have much less confidence and be a sad person because I wouldnt have something to keep me happy outside of school. Because of the principles decision students might find an activity they are passionate about and enjoy doing. I had so many great experiences playing soccer and I want everyone to be able to have similar ones in whatever activity they choose.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the principle's decision for every student to have a mandatory extracurricular activity because they can be a way to make new friends and strengthen other friendships, and they can help you find an activity that you really enjoy. I play soccer and I have made really good friends from my team, and I have also found out that I love soccer and I enjoy it very much. Due to every student having to do an extra curricular activity some of those people might really enjoy their activity and make friends from it like I did and that would be amazing.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities are exhilarating in a variety of different ways. Extracurriculars can also be very helpful in the future. Getting involved in an extracurricular activity is a phenomenal way to make new friends, and obtain special skills. Being apart of an after school activity can help people make new friends.\n\nPeople that are participating in the same club or sport have one common interest. For example, my friend is in the Photography Club, and she has met some people that also enjoy taking candid photographs just like she does. My brother is also in the Drama Club at Generic_School all the people in the Drama Club with my brother have the same passion for acting as my brother does.\n\nBeing on a sports team can help when you trust the other people on the team. When students are on sports teams coaches like to play icebreaker games to help everyone on the team get to know each other, and to trust each other. If and when every team member trusts everyone on the team they can start playing like a team.\n\nIn school students sometimes pretend to be someone they aren't, but when they are at their club or at sports practice they become their true selves.\n\nStudents are afraid to be who they really are because they think if they show others the real them then they won't be liked. Though when their in a club or on a team they begin to feel less afraid and are more comfortable with their peers. These are the reasons why I think joining an extracurricular activity would help students make friends.\n\nParticipating in an after school activity can help people attain special skills. Being on a sports team requires having an enormous amount of stamina and effort. For instance, when boys join the football team they have to work really hard to build up their stamina to run really far, and to block the opposing team from scoring. They also have to practice, and if they actually want to have a chance of winning they need to put in a tremendous amount of effort while in practice to do so. Someone on the football team with a little practice can gain the skill of building up a gigantic amount of stamina and, they can learn to put as much effort as they can into everything they do.\n\nIf people join a club they can learn leadership skills and learn to be more confident. An example of this is if someone joined the school newspaper, and they were named head editor they would have to give people articles to write, and would edit and go over people's work with them. The editor would learn how to lead their peers to victory with the printing of the finalized copy of the school paper. Also, if a person joined the debate team they would learn to speak clearer, and with more confident.\n\nAnother skill that people can learn if they join a club is learning to be patient. When I was in 7th grade I was in a club called best buddies, and in this club I was helping disabled kids with little projects and things that were difficult for them. Working with them taught me that I need to be more patient with people because someone never knows what another person is going thorough. This is why participating in an extracurricular activity will help you learn special skills. Joining after school activities is a outstanding way to establish friendships,and learn impressive skills. Students will never know what to expect when it come to after school activities. But it is always an adventure.",

For example,students have seven to eight hours a day of school so they are going to be exhausted at the end of school. For instance,students might have had a test and they have to stay after school for an extracurricular activity. students would start to dislike school for making them stay after school for activities they dont want to do. For example, students dont want to stay in school for more than seven or eight hours a day, It's exhausting to have to stay in school for up to nine hours for activities you dont want to do. We should not have to take an extracurricular activity.\n\nAlso, students should not have to take an extracurricular activity because students might have somethings to do after school. For example, students might have chores to do around there home, not every student can stay after school everyday. For example, students might have a doctor's appointment after school and they cant stay after school and students have to get a note from there parents saying they have a doctor's appointment. For instance,Students might be on a sports team and they have to go to training or they have a game,what are they going to do then? Students should not have to take an after school activity.\n\nFinally,The students should not be forced to take an extra activity because the teachers dont want to stay after school everyday. For example Teachers have longer hours than the students. Teachers get to school before the students, and leave school after the students and sometimes they even stay after school. Teachers are exhausted after school and the teachers choose to stay after school, they should not have to stay after school everyday. For instance,teachers are going to be cranky at the end of the day because there may be some kids who made the teacher angry or the teacher is just tired at the end of the day either way the teachers should not have to stay after school, only the ones who choose to stay after school should stay. For example,teachers choose to stay after school to grade students work and teacher choose a day or two to stay after school to help the students who need help and if they stayed after school everyday they would not want to stay after school to grade or to help the students with work. Teachers should not have to stay after school everyday.\n\n'If students stayed after school everyday they would not have time to do what they like at home.''\n\nI disagree with extracurricular activities and we should not have to take an extra activity after school because students are tired at the end of the day,students might have somethings to do after school,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.\n\nStudents should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity because they have seven to eight hours of school a day, they might be on a sports team or have chores,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.\n\nStudents, we all should convince our principals that we should not have to take an extracurricular activity we already have a lot of things to do at home and at school.",

    Essay: "Extra curricular activities give students an opportunity to be on a team or with a group of people with shared interests as them. They are very beneficial for students, but many kids don't participate in after school activities because they are to busy with school.\n\nBecause some parents force there kids to spend little to no time with there friends and hours studying. Their kids may end up with little social skills and poor mental health. Though excessive time studying may seem beneficial; to much time studying actually harms the students. Mandatory extra curricular activities would help to give students more control over their lives and let them to have a social life. Many adults would have never thought to try any after school activities if their school didn't force them to, yet so many parents don't allow there kids to participate in those activities that they once loved as a kid. A lot of students feel at ease when doing a sport or playing their instrument, and they never would have thought to try it if they had no reason to. Making students participate in extra curricular activities is beneficial for their physical and mental health because it helps students make more friends and find their passion.\n\nSince there is so much pressure for student to maintain a high GPA, some students make studying more of a priority than their social life. It gets so extreme to the point where some students spend all there time doing homework, but spend little to no time hanging out with their friends. This makes students struggle socially. Extra curricular activities give students a chance to take a break from homework and be in a group of people with the same interests and same goal as them. Pushing students to do extra curricular activities would help them to spend less time studying and more time spent on an activity that they love. There are a lot of students that are strong academically, but many of those students can't communicate with other people or work in a team, so no matter how smart they are they wouldn't excel in any job. Because every job requires communication and social skills, students need to develop those skills while still in school to get a secure job in their future. Increasing communication and teamwork is not the only reason that after school activities are beneficial.\n\nThere are many adults that would have never found their passion if there weren't activities for them to try. Since stress is only increasing for students, they tend to spend more time studying trying to improve already good grades then doing an activity that they love. Students feel so stuck feeling like they can only do school work, but when they have other activities it can really clear their head; as well as make them realize that they work well in a certain field. For example if a student were to join the SCA and like it they could realize that they want to take on more leadership roles and one day run a company. If that student was forced to study and had no free time to be on the SCA they may have never realized how much they like leadership roles. They may have never gotten the chance to start the company and there life would be so different. Plus students are more likely to get accepted in a good college for continuing with an activity that they love with a slightly lower GPA then having a perfect GPA, never have participating in any extra curricular activities, so after school activities are also helping students to get into college.\n\nA lot of extra curricular activities are offered, and by making them mandatory it will make many students realize that they are passionate about some things. Whether that activity be a sport, an instrument, or a leadership role. While there is something out there for everyone students wanting to participate in an activity isn't as common as many may think. Pushing students to find their activity will help them in their future. There is no way out of communication and teamwork so giving students the opportunity to learn those skills in school only benefits them. By not enforcing extra curricular activities on students, many students futures are being harmed. By not letting kids have social lives or giving students the opportunity to find their passion students are going to struggle in their future adult life a lot more then they ever needed to struggle. This can be avoided by just simply making after school activities mandatory; having students focus on things other then school and studying.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities are fun, but are they really a good thing? The principal of Generic_School has made these activities mandatory. Extracurricular activities can be a bad thing, they take away free time that could be spent with family or friends, they could leave students without enough time or energy to do homework, and they are a distraction that takes focus from school.\n\nExtracurricular activities take time away from family and friends. That time taken away from family and friends weakens the bonds that they share with the students, and when it comes to hard times those weakened bonds make them turn their backs on one another. The students would become distant and unsocial because all their time would be invested in the activities instead of with other people. They could even become stressed because they are not spending time with family and friends. This is one reason that the decision to these activities mandatory was slightly hasty.\n\nExtracurricular activities are exhausting and take time to participate in. Therefore these activities leave the students without enough time or energy to do homework. Without the homework that supports their grades, the students grades will slip and tumble from A's and B's all the down to D's and F's. If the students stay up late trying to get the mountain of homework completed they will not get enough sleep and the next day in class they will be tired and unable to pay attention. They will have no idea what is happening in class because the homework they didn't have time to do explained the things that the class went over in more detail. They will need to retake the class, but as long as the activities that they have take time and energy the same outcome will occur.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a distraction that takes focus from schoolwork. The students thoughts would start to wander to what they could introduce into a discussion or what kind of thing that they could ask people in the yearbook and they could miss an entire lecture. Even when they try to listen they can't concentrate enough to remember what was said in the class ten minutes after class ended. The students may even try to cheat because they didn't pay attention in class and went into the test taking area unprepared. All of these things can make a school look bad on many types of forms and reviews.\n\nIn conclusion extracurricular activities are not good for some students and making them mandatory was a bad idea. Some students can do several after school activities and still be perfectly fine while others may not be okay with even one. It all depends on what the students are capable of and where their boundaries lie.",

    Essay: "Imagine your principal coming on the broadcast radio at your school while you are in school and telling everybody that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. How would you feel, being told that you have to do something even if you don't want to do it? Your opinion is not being asked for, and your principal is still going on with the idea. This is not fair because there are good reasons that some people do not participate in extracurricular activities. I disagree with this idea because students may not be able to do these activities, student should choose what they do with their free time, and it will teach students to look after themselves if we do not force them to do extracurricular activities.\n\nOne reason this decision should not be implemented is because not all students are able to participate in these activities. They could be busy at home and not have time to do stay at school after school hours. As a result, they might be more stressed, and could get less sleep because they have enough to do after school as it is. They also might live too far away from school, disabling them from doing these activities. Making it mandatory for students to do something they might not be able to do is wrong, and should not be done.\n\nAnother reason students should not have to participate in extra curricular activities is because they should be able to choose what they do when they are learning not in school. It should be their choice of what they should do because they should not have to do anything they do not want to do. Giving them a free choice will make them happier because they are not being told what to do. Letting them make the decision for themselves will help them to become more independent and less reliant on other people making the decisions for them. Making a decision for the students will not help them in the future, and should be avoided as much as possible.\n\nIf the decision is made by the students themselves, they will be able to look out for themselves better in the future. Having the students do things in their own minds will get them in the habit of doing acting alone when they grow up. Forcing people who are not willing to do something does not help the students, because the students might be more likely to get distracted from the thing they are doing because they do not want to do it. Not having the opportunity to do something themselves could diminish the ability to become independent in the future. If the decision is left for them, they can learn to become strong independently as adults.\n\nOverall, this decision to make it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular activity is flawed. Making students do something that they aren't able to do can make them stressed on other things as well as school. Letting students choose what they do in their own time could help them over time to make these decisions for themselves. If they make the decisions without anybody else, this will get them into a habit of making their own decisions in the future as adults. Giving the students space to make decisions for themselves will help them in the present as well as the future.",

    Essay: "67% of students show beneficial growth through participating in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities help yourself out. Here is how I think that extracurricular activities can benefit you. Extracurricular activities are very beneficial because student can learn new life skills, they can help out with their school, and they can gain physical health.\n\nFirst of all, students can learn new skills that they can use in everyday life. Students can learn helpful communication skills by joining an activities that involve communication. For instance, If a student learns new communication skills then they can use them to get a job and become successful. It is not just communication it is learning how to act to someone. I promise if you learn these skills you will be benefited.\n\nSecondly, you can help out your school by encouraging other people. By encouraging other people, not only will you help other people, but you will help yourself. As an example, if you serve on the student council you can help your school become a better place. Encouraging other people makes you feel good inside like you did something that made an impact.\n\nlastly, students can gain physical health by participating on sports. Obesity is a problem in our country, but if we encourage children to get active. We can lower that number. Student could also find a sport that fits them, so they enjoy it. It can also make them stay with that sport for longer. Students also can find playing a sport can be really fun. If the children like the sport they will see the benefit it will bring them.\n\nBy learning new life skills, helping out with your school , and participating in physical activity you will see the benefit it brings you. If you do these things great, if you dont do them please do them, you will see benefit. Extracurricular activities are not just regular activities, they are activities you can learn from. Extracurricular activities are there so you try and learn new things, because if your not learning or trying we won't get anywhere.",

    Essay: "My school is adding a rule. the rule is every one needs to play a type of sport or needs to do something related like help around the school. I agree on this because the teachers often get tired of teaching and will do more for the school activities. Most students don't do any activities at home and can develop hobbies by helping around the school. Also the teachers may not think of good,fun ideas so the students can get creative on the activities. The students can also plan any dances coming up or can come up with some type of events that are coming up for the school.\n\nThere are teachers that work all day and get home till every one leaves the school and if she got chosen to be a helper around the school she would get home even more late then usual. Teachers are very hardworking and always get exhausted while teaching cause she is talking all day. The students are basically helping cause they are taking out time of there day to some activities at there school. Teachers dont need to do as much work as they normally do and the students can help them at anything cause its a activity to help around the school.\n\nThere are a lot of students that dont do any activities at home and can maybe help around the school rather than be at home and do nothing. There are many students that are not athletic than other people and cant do many sports because they are not fit for the sport or dosen't ant to get hurt. Helping around the school cant get any body hurt. They can also help the school by improving it by adding some new things to the school. They can interact with people if they are always going to be at the school. they can develop some type of hobbie just by helping around the school.\n\nThey students can also create some fun ideas for the school cause they may be more open minded. The students can plan some upcoming events for the school cause that may have more fun and better ideas than teachers. There are more students that can come up with some GOOD ideas for dances,any type of upcoming events. Many teachers cant come up with fun ideas cause they dont know what type of music we like neither food.\n\nI agreed because there arent as many students that do stuff at home or just dont like doing any activities. There are many teachers that often get more tired than others so which means the students can do some work for them if needed or just help around the school not just the teachers. The students can make the school have a better name because of the sportsman ship they are having.",

    Essay: "One day you principal decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, this can range from sports to running for student council. This may sound great at first but once you analyze the situation and realize this may not be ideal for all families, you will see why this idea should be expelled right away.\n\nTo begin, the main question we should be asking is why, why are these students being told they have to participate in these activities?\n\nNot only should we be asking why, we should be asking;\n\nWhat would happen if they don't?\n\nFrom family matters, money issues, transportation, to school work,, there are many reasons a student may not be able to participate in these activities.\n\nTo further explain my reasoning, all people have families, and with these families comes matters and other issues that need to be dealt with. For example, if a family member in this students' life happens to pass away, is the school going to tell this child to get over it and come do their activity? Or say these parents dont pay for some sort of child care system and they give this responsibility to the eldest child, are the schools going to punish these children because have to take care of their younger sibling? From slight examination, this doesn't look to good for the schools.\n\nIf the schools are going implement this mandatory rule, how will they make it so all kids can participate? This leads to my next statement,\n\nWill the schools provide transportation to the students who may need it?\n\nSpeaking on personal experience it can be difficult for students to get a ride home after activities when their only source of transportation is their guardians who may be unable to pick them up for reasons such as working, inability to drive, and many reasons which would make it near impossible for the child to get home. Also it can be quite embarrassing to ask for a ride home everyday. This can also lead to another major problem, kidnapping, the schools may be unaware as to whom the child is going home with and that can lead to a serious problem and a possible lawsuit on the schools hands. Furthermore, if the school are serious about this plan then they will be responsible for making sure every child is safe and has a stable way of getting home.\n\nTo continue on the topic of schools providing, lets talk about financial issues for the students and the schools as well. Not only will the schools have to give up an exponential amount of money to provide resources fro these activities, the students will too. More often than not, the guardians of these students have to give up a good amount of money in order to participate in this activities, and often times the schools forget that not everyone has the same amount of financial stability. This can lead to the student feeling left out when their classmates have stuff they nay not be able to afford, or in other instances, bullying. In order for each student to feel included the schools will have to pay for all of the resources.\n\nAll of the previous points may sound bad, but this upcoming one should persuade you on its own. From family matters to financial issues nothing really compares to what could be happening to these young people if they are forced to do these activities. While these activities may be fun, each child has to eventually go home to complete any school work. With this gargantuan load of waking up early in the morning, attending school for eight hours each day, going to their activity, and then going home to do more school work can induce an amount of stress no one under the age of 20 should ever endure. While reading this you may be wondering about the students who voluntarily do these activities, they choose to participate in this and they can better plan out their schedule and balance their work. However if this idea is put into action these students won't have much of a choice.\n\nWhen you are given a good chunk of the facts, do you really want your child to have to worry about being kidnapped, being excluded by their classmates, or endure an unnessasary amount of stress at a very young age? Do you want your child to be unable to focus in class because of the large work load that's being dumped on them? If not, it is your responsibility to tell your school districts that you don't think this is best for your child, and they should be able to live as a child.\n\nIn conclusion no child should have to worry about juggling these tasks nor should they be worried about going missing, being bullied, or any stress that can mess with their mental health or their performance on school. This is why you should say no to involuntary activities placed by the schools.",

    Essay: "How would you feel if your principal said it is mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? It could be anything like sports, you could work on the year book, or serve on the student council. Some of you may wonder if this would be a good idea or not to make it mandatory to participate in these activity. In my opinion, I think this would not be a great idea to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. In this essay I will give specific details and examples why I think this wouldn't be a good idea.\n\nOne of my reasons why I think that making it mandatory to do an activity isn't a good idea is because of different peoples attitude. Some people may have a great reaction to knowing and some others may not even care because maybe they are in an extracurricular activity now. Others could have a negative reaction to it which could be a problem. A reason why this could be a problem is because if they act negatively to this,they could make it hard on the teacher giving them bad attitudes to the teacher make it a whole lot stressful for the teacher if the student doesn't want to be there.\n\nSome people may think that this could be a good thing because it could maybe help students in different ways. Being in a extracurricular activity like Sports could maybe help people be more athletic then they already are. To those who want to be athletic being in something like sports could dramatically help them get what they want to accomplish. Being in a extracurricular activity like maybe some kind of math activity could help different people learn what they want or need to learn. Some people could just like it in general because they can do something they always wanted to and now have the chance to.\n\nLastly another reason why I think this wouldn't be a good idea is because of maybe cause of the parents. what would they do then if a parent of a child doesn't want there child to participate or don't want them to do a extracurricular activity? Then what would the principal do in these kind of problems? These are all things the principal would have to think about before making a decision to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. Another thing you have to think about is if a student has a disorder or has some kind of sickness mentally or physically then what would the principal do?\n\nThese are all valuable reasons and things that play a big part in making a big decision like this. The principal has a lot of things to do/ think about before making a decision like this. I gave reasons why this could be a good thing but, I also gave reasoning on my opinion which is to not make this a mandatory thing. Ultimately I think this wouldn't be a good decision at all and this shouldn't be a mandatory thing.",

We should all do at least one because participating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships, they can give you something to do, and you can find things you love to do.\n\nParticipating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships. I found my best friend in an art class after school, she now lives in Generic_City and we are closer then ever. I didnt want to go at first but once I found her, it was the only place I wanted to be. I am currently in the school play and I've found so many people that share my interests. I have also made so many new friends and now we do stuff outside of school.\n\nBeing in an extra curricular activity can also give you something to do. Before I started them all I would do is sit at home alone being bored, now I have something to do. Even when I'm not there I still do stuff for it, and instead of being bored and alone I can talk to people who are also in my extra curricular's.\n\nWhen you are in an extra curricular activity you can find things you really love to do. Before I was in any extra curricular's I didnt know I could paint, sing or do anything, I thought i was just a normal boring person.

I'm still taking gymnastics right now. I also found out that I loved theater, I joined a play because of my friend and it turns out that it wasn't so difficult after all.\n\nIn conclusion we should all do at least one extra curricular activity.

    Essay: "Did you know when you are having fun your mind is focused on what you are doing and nothing else. Yes, I think kids should get into sports/activities because they can make new friends, have fun, and it can take their minds off of things. It might be time consuming and stressful but if you are having fun that's all that matters. You also don't want to regret not doing any extra activities in the future so I would advise students to get more involved if they would like.\n\nKids should get more involved so they can make new friends. If they are going to play a sport their teamwork can start to increase if they are making new friends weather they like them or not it makes you feel better inside about yourself and if your coach were to see he/she would be so proud and might talk to you about it. If you make friends along the year with them then you guys can hangout outside of practice/activities. They can also practice with you and help you out to. If you don't really like them its your choice if you hangout with them or not but once you get to know them better it is always good. Overall it is always better having someone by your side then having no one.\n\nActivities are always fun if you make it out to be. It is only boring if you make it seem that way, so if you actually get into the activity and act like your having fun then maybe it will be. It is always about having fun so if your not having fun then theirs no point but if you put a smile on your face and try with your friends than you will have a great time. If you wanted to excersize but never have the time or don't feel like doing it, you can do it in your sport because most likely they will make you run,stretch, or make you do some type of excersize before or after games/practices. It may be stressful at first but you have to fake it till you make it. If your making the most out of it and having a blast that's all that really matters.\n\nWhen I did cheer my mind was only focused on that and nothing else around me. I was not stressed because I was only paying attention on cheer but if you take your mind somewhere else and think about how much homework you have to do or if you have to clean your room before your parents see that will be what is making you stress out. Before you think about that you have to think about what is happening now in the present tense not past or future because you can think/do that when the time comes. While your playing a sport that should be the only thing that is in your head at the moment. Everything is only hard if you think about it for an example if you like someone and think it will be akward talking to them it will only be if you make it that way. Same as in stress it's what you control if you are going to make it stressful or not.\n\nIt could take up some of your time but it is worth it in the end. If you are having fun,making friends, and nothing is stressing you out than I say go for it and try-out for the team, or helpout teachers, or get into a club whatever makes you happy at the end of the day. This is why I think kids in school should get involved without their being any stress, making friends, and having fun.",

    Essay: "Do you believe schools should make students do at least one extracurricular activity? Because, I think you should be able to choose if you want to. Some people believe you should make students do this stuff, but it just doesn't seem right to me. Some people physically can't make it to things like this. Making students do an extracurricular activity could cause less family time, or distraction to life and school, or even make them upset because they can't find an activity that fits them.\n\nFirst, some kids already have limited family time. They wake up and go to school for about 7 hours, then they come home and do their home work, and that right there is a lot of hours taken away which means only a few hours is left for family. A lot of kids want more family time and making them do stuff like this would just make it worse. Some parents even make their kids do things like chores. If they have a activity they have to do then they would have to do chores on the weekend when they are free and actually are with their family.\n\nSecondly, if students have to do an activity, it could end up distracting them from doing their work. Some might end up liking it so much to the point where it takes all their time away from studying and homework. But others, could end up disliking it so much that they stress about having to do it to the point where it's such a big distraction they can't focus because they are anxious about even going. So it could go either way and end up bad for the students.\n\nLastly, some students get so upset that they can't find something they enjoy. Sports and these types of clubs aren't for everyone. When trying to find an activity, it can be hard for students. If they can't find something they like, they tend to get very anxious and upset. They don't have activities for every type of person at school, and that's why some students just don't fit in with clubs.\n\nTherefore, I suggest that no one should make students do extra activities like that if they don't want to, it's not for everyone and that's okay. If a student really wanted to do an activity like that, then they would. I believe suggesting activities like this to students would be very nice, but don't control them. What do you believe?

    Essay: "Have you ever thought about staying after school with your friends? To maybe relax and talk to some of your teachers, play some basketball with the upper classmates, and spend time with others that you don't normally see. Many are the reasons why forcing students to complete at least one extracurricular activity a week is important. First of all it will increase the number of other students you have connections with, you could find a new hobby or spend time to perfect one, and finally bad behavior will decrease and lead to healthier choices.\n\nAlthough It is always important to take a break by spending your time on something you truly like, extracurricular activities not only expand your knowledge but also your friend group. By spending time with others that have the same passions as you, you will find connections with other students and make friends. Therefor if an individual just moved from another state, chances are low that they know anyone, after school activities like basketball will bring them together with many others. Higher levels of education can bring an extreme everyday stress, being able to play a sport or do puzzles instead of keeping it to your self, will release a lot of it.\n\nThis activities can also help you find hobbies you might to pursue in your future years or even as a career.\n\nFor example enrolling in the student council will maybe spark an interest in politics, and year book club a love for photography, the possibilities are infinite. These grades of school are all about changes, if an activity you started at the beginning of the school year does not interest you anymore, you could always switch to an alternate. Because practice is a big factor of success, perfecting a hobby you already know is also great. While trying all of this, you will always find someone that will be with you.\n\nStaying after school hours will decrease bad decisions. In a closed and constructed environment supervisors will always be around to guide the student to the next level of their learning. Instead of just going home and laying on the bed or couch for endless hours, staying at school will give you motivation to do your home work. Sometimes just staying after school is better than being alone. It's easier to be pushed with the wrong people whose principles are not healthy. I try to stay after school at least once a week, one time for constructive work that will teach me something unusual, such as\n\nMUN\n\n( Model United Nations), and another day for recreational purposes, like basketball for the school's team.\n\nThe participation of every student in extracurricular activities once a week is essential, and an extraordinary idea. Although school already takes about 8 hours a day, staying after school at least four times a month is a valid usage of your time. Gives everyone a chance to discover new hobbies or make some of their old ones even better, it helps the students release stress and find new friends but most importantly it increases a healthier life with fewer bad decisions. Having the chance of staying after school gave me the possibility to make one if my closest friends, and to win many middle school MUN conferences. Overall the effect of after school on students is positive.",

Why do we have to participate in at least one activity. I disagree with what my principal said, because some students can't participate. The students can't participate is, because there mom and dad might not want them to be doing sport.\n\nRecently studies have shown were people are getting hurt by play a sport. I dont think that would be a good idea on the principal part, because she would have a lot of her students at her school hurt and can do stuff.

    Essay: "Swish, that is the sound of the basketball going into the net, pow, that is the sound of the gavel going down as people are talking on the student council, and it is the sound of all the students participating in these activities getting smarter as they progress in them. After school activities are often a thing of life for kids. Most parents put their children in after school activities so that the child can grow and have productive things to do. As well as so that the child can learn to accept defeat and cooperate with other people. So if the principle thinks that he should have all kids commit to some after school activity I would support him, so that the children of this school could gain valuable life skills, keep out of trouble, and grow physically and mentally.\n\nExtracurricular activities help students by helping them to grow physically and mentally. For example when you play sports you condition your body physically. As well when you do a mathematical or core subject related activity you grow mentally. And finally when you are on the debate team, or yearbook comity, or even the student council you often grow mentally. This is one of the ways doing after school activities can help kids, but it can also helps children in other ways.\n\nDoing after school activities can keep children out of trouble, and they can help children by giving them something productive to do. Families dont always have a ton of money, and this can cause some families to live in a bad part of town, and that is not what we want for our children so putting these children in after school activities can help keep them out of trouble. As well some children do not have good home lives, and after school activities can often help with this, by keeping them out of that situation as long as possible, and eventually the child might feel comfortable telling a coach or teacher about this who can help that child. Adding to that a lot of children have nothing to do when they get home and will spend hours playing video games or checking social media, and putting them in a extracurricular activities can help balance the time they spend on those devices. So now you some of the ways afterschool activities can help keep students out of trouble, and help them be productive, but there are more ways that after school activities are good for children.\n\nDoing after school activities can also help children build valuable skill that can be used when he or she becomes a adult. Children doing these activities lose one time or another while doing them, and this can teach the child about losing gracefully, and that it is OK to lose. As well in extracurricular activities a child will often be faced with problems and solving them will help the child build good problem solving skills that can be used later in life. To add to that when you do just about any after school activity you have to work in a team to do something, and this will help children build valuable team work skills that he or she will need in just about any profession. These are the reasons why I think that every child should commit do doing at least one after school activity.\n\nThere are many reasons why doing after school activities are good. Like the fact that they build good life skills. As well as that extracurricular activities give children something productive to do. And finally they help children grow physically and mentally. So for these reasons I agree that all children should be required to do after school activities.",

Well, your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be in school or outside of school like sports or book club. I disagree with having to do a activity, for students could have plans with others or family outside of school, they could have something wrong with them or something wrong is happening that they aren't able to participate in their activity, or a student may have a job outside of school.\n\nTo being with, having to do one extracurricular activity would be terrible if a student had planned to do something before hand. Lets say you had plans to go out with a group of friends to have ice cream,and since your principal has made everyone do an activity you went with softball or some kind of sport. Your team has practice the same day you made plans with your friends and now you have to choose between the two, your friends or practice for the big game coming up. Having to do a extracurricular activity would be unfair for that simple reason.\n\nNext, a student could have something wrong with them or something wrong is happening to them that could prevent them from doing the activity poorly or preventing them from doing it all. For example, your friend has just got a medical cast for his leg since he hurt himself on accident playing around. He signed up for soccer since he must do an activity and there is a big game coming up and he needs to be there for his team. He is unable to play currently due to his medical cast stopping him. He is upset and cannot play soccer for his team and friends.\n\nThen, a student could have a job to do outside of school and their activity is messing up their hours or the job. they could get fired or lose money due to the extracurricular activity they are forced to do. For example, Generic_Name has a job at the local supermarket and she starts work at four. She has also signed up for art club which starts at four every other day. Due to the activity starting as soon as her work starts she has to miss work or the activity and she will get in trouble any way she chooses because they both start at the same time.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with having to do a extracurricular activity because it could mess up plans with others or yourself, it could be hard doing the activity due to something wrong with a student and it could ruin peoples day with the schedule of the activity.",

Also it's a great way to keep your grades up because if your in a activity you enjoy and your grades are falling you are going to want to work harder so your grades can stay up and you can remain in that activity. And the fun part is you get to meet new people that are into the same things as you so that's a win win. It's normally if you have a B or a A you can go on trips with the people in the activity you picked so you would be having good grades all the time.\n\nI agree because it's a great way to keep your grades up, meet new people and also give you a good image if you are nice and not disrespectful. You can even get into a collage if you do join a activiy so why no just do it.",

    Essay: "Mrs. Generic_Name just announced that all students must participate in one or more extracurricular activities. Everyone one doesn't know what they are are going to do now and disagrees with her. Me, myself agree's with Mrs. Generic_Name, however, most students do nothing after they get home for school. So, being in an extracurricular activity can be fun, you can do clubs, sports, and volunteering.\n\nFirst, in clubs you can do a lot of interesting things. My brother is in FFA, and last spring break he went to Texas with his FFA club. They went to Forth Worth, Alabama, and Nashville. Which those place are very cool to go and visit. Then also in FFA you can do a CDE, which is where you can study about different things. I do small animal care therefore, you learn about different animals, diseases, and how to take care of an animal. Also if you're in a club you can make friends out of you state. I went to national convention this fall and meet a kid for Georgia and we still talk to this day.\n\nSecondly, you can be in a sport. \"Sports make you blood flow\" as my mom would always tell me. That's why she would always like for me and my brother to play a sport. You're getting exercise when you are playing and getting exercise is good for your body. If you are doing a sport that you really enjoy, you could be an professional player. Being an professional means you're really good and enjoy doing what you do. By playing sports year after year you will make some friend that you probably didn't think you would be friend with. I play volleyball for a travel team and for JV and I've made some pretty close friends because I played year after year.\n\nLastly, you can volunteer. You can volunteer different places like the SPCA and fire fighter. Volunteering in your community by picking up trash. I volunteer at a SPCA ,I help the animals and take them for a walk. I feel like everyone should at least volunteer somewhere in there community because people are littering and not putting it in the trash can like they are suppose to. I've have always thought this in my head, \" We give to the community, the community will get back to the citizens.\"\n\nThere are so much more busy people then there were 20 years ago.\n\nMrs. Generic_Name wants every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Yet, all of the student are disagreeing with her. But I think everyone should because, they won't do anything when they get home for school. Extracurricular activities are good for you. You can play a sport, volunteer, and be in a club. All three of them are fun to be in and do.",

    Essay: "Students should have free time to get away from class for a while but some do not want to get away from class . So it is wrong that the principal is forcing this pressure on students to have to participate in at least one \"extracurricular activity\". Some students enjoy sports or student council and year book staff but some also enjoy spending time in class and paying attention and getting their work done. So you can't force them to participate in other stuff that they might not enjoy . So Why put pressure on them and say that they have to do this or do that ?? And what if there's not good options to pick from then that puts even more pressure on the student . There is no reason we should have to take at least one activity that liberty believes is benefiting the students when really all it's doing is putting stress on the students .\n\nWhat if the options they have is not what the students are interested in. Because some are in to sports and you have to be good at that sport if you want to make the team. But then lets say the students does not make the team that leaves them with the other stuff they may not want to do, but it's not optional according to the principal we have to take some sort of extracurricular activity but some people arent good enough to do what they really enjoy so dont put un needed pressure on them .",

    Essay: "How would you feel if, all of a sudden, you were forced to take on an extra task like participating in an extracurricular activity? My principal has decided to make it a requirement that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I completely disagree with this decision because there are students who have other important responsibilities, this decision could take students' focus away from school work, and students should be allowed to make there own choices.\n\nThere are multiple students that have quite a few responsibilities outside of school. For example, there are students who have jobs, chores, and homework to complete. Everyone has a different situation. What if there is a student who has a sick relative, or a sibling they care for after school? What happens when there is no one else to fill that students role as caretaker? That student can't neglect there responsibilities to take part in an extracurricular activity they are forced to participate in. By making this decision, not only are we being forced to participate in activities we might not have time for, but we are also being forced to put our priorities on hold and juggle more tasks than we can handle.\n\nThe main reason we go to school is to gain knowledge and obtain skills to help us become successful. The principal's decision to make participating in extracurricular activities mandatory could take students' focus away from learning and make completing school work difficult. For instance, students who play sports have to stay after school and do not not arrive home until late evening hours. Those students are being deprived of extra hours that could have been used to study, do homework, or catch up in a class they are behind in. Some students already struggle with classes, and by adding extracurricular activities to their plate, it would only make it more difficult for them. Our principal should be focused on making our education the main priority, not prioritizing activities that will not cause significant benefits.\n\nEvery individual has the right to make their own decisions. Students' freedoms are being limited by the principal's decision to make participating in extracurricular activities a requirement. There are students who are just simply uninterested in these activities, and do not want to participate in them. It should be our choice, as students, to decide our interest and the activities we take part in. Adults are not forced to work at a specific job, or even forced to go to work at all. Likewise, student's should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities. We have the complete capability to make decisions for ourselves and we can not allow the principal to take away our freedom of choice. If we allow this one freedom to be taken away, we can only expect to be limited to even more freedoms in the future.\n\nI strongly encourage our principal to rethink his decision on requiring all students to participate in extracurricular activities. This decision fully impacts the students, and we should be allowed to have a say in the matter. We are being forced to put our priorities on hold, try to maintain focus, and be limited to our freedoms. Students have to stand up for themselves and we have to take back control of our lives.",

    Essay: "With ideas of the future flying through my head, new people all around me, and a pen in my hand, I excitedly sign up for yearbook. Many students enjoy extracurricular activities, such as a sport, band, or yearbook. I believe that all students should participate in an activity that interests them because you have the opportunity to meet new people, enjoy new experiences, and have the chance to prepare for the future.\n\nChoosing one of these activities can lead to life long friends that share the same interests. You can meet new people who are just as passionate about an activity as you are. I joined yearbook and met many people who had a love for writing and journalism just as I do. You can discover who you want to be surrounded by in your life by finding different people through these activities. You find people who are working towards the same goal as you are, and you can help each other along the way.\n\nNew experiences are another benefit you receive from joining and extracurricular class. You have the once in a lifetime chance to experience these new activities. You can see what you are good at and what you enjoy, which could lead to a career in the future. If you join cross country you may find that you love the feeling of the wind against your face. If you join yearbook you may discover that you have a passion for journalism. You can perfect a skill that you have always had an interest for or you might find that you have a passion for something that you never thought of before.\n\nParticipating in an extracurricular class will help you prepare for adulthood. You will have to learn how to balance your time between education, relationships with family and friends, chores, and the activity you choose. In fifth grade I joined soccer, at that time homework was new to me, so I had to learn to balance chores, homework, and soccer. I benefited from this experience greatly, because when the middle school approached I had already learned how to balance my time, which made the transition easier. This will prepare you for college and everything after. Learning how to balance everything in your life is a skill necessary for when you become an adult. It is better to learn these skills when you are of a young age than having to learn it in the middle of a chaotic life in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, joining these activities offers many benefits. You will spend less time on electronics, which is healthy for the minds of all ages. You can exercise your mind by learning new skills and meeting different people.\n\nI believe that all students should join an extracurricular activity because you can meet different people, and enjoy many new experiences while preparing for your adult life. Although it can be frightening to try new things, it will benefit you in abundant ways.\n\nI find I live a much happier life when I am doing something I love, even though it may frighten me, than when I am playing it safe by never trying anything new.",

    Essay: "I disagree with the principal in saying every student should do a extracurricular activity for three reasons.\n\nOne reason I disagree is because not everyone has the time to do these activities. Like some students might have younger siblings to take care of or afterschool jobs they have to do, such as walking dogs, babysitting, tutoring, and other things. Also some students have responsibilities to do when they get home, maybe they have an elderly person at home, and its their responsibility to take care of that person as soon as school ends.\n\nSecond reason why i disagree is, students should be able to choose whether or not they want to do the extracurricular activity. It shouldn't be up to the principal, because the school might not have the sport or the club a student might be interested in. Not every student enjoys sports, clubs or people in general, so they would think this new rule is unfair and that the principal should've asked them how they felt about it before coming up with this rule.\n\nMy last reason for disagreeing with the principal is that some students might have a curfew or a time that they should be home by afterschool. Extracurricular activities take at least an hour or two, and lets say the school day ends at 3:45 and your staying afterschool for a club and that club takes two hours, and the bus ride is thirty minutes, which means you'll get home sometime after six. Your parents might tell you that you should've been home an hour ago, then you'll get in trouble, so for some students extracurricular activities aren't for them.\n\nThis is why i disagree with the principal, next time I hope they keep the students in mind before they make a new school rule or if they had talked to the students before making a decision.",

    Essay: "Extra is in the Name\n\nExtracurricular programs are more school work and/or more time that students have to spend at school. Not many students want that. Students should not have to participate in extracurriculars because they might not have enough time, they will have no intrest in something they don't want to do and most students don't want that extra work. I know that most students don't want to do extracuricular activities and for the ones that do they will take them i nthe first place.\n\nThe first reason I think students should not have to take extracurricular activites is because a lot of them won't have time. It's that simple. After school, rather than going to some club or activity that they don't want to take in the first place, they may have sports practice or homework and studying to do. Whatever the student has after school is probabaly more important than the extracurricular activity that they are forced to take. For the activities that are in school, there will still be work to get done out of school as well. As a student I know that having too much can be very stressful.\n\nThe second reason I think students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities is they will have a lack of intrest. Most students won't want to take the program so they won't try while taking it. It will be hard for whoever is running the program to teach, especially if it's not a grade and no one cares about it. On top of all that it will be a waste of time for both the students and the teacher and they just won't want to be there.\n\nFinally, while the students aren't enjoying the extracurricular activity they will be rushing to get their work finished just get out that class or go home. The students are also likely to have an atitude and be rude to the instructor. Abviously the instructor won't like this and they too won't want to be running this program but he/she may be at force to run it like the students are to take it.\n\nThe three main reasons why students should not have to do extracurricular activites are not enough spare time for students, lack of intrest in program they are taking and students need free time time away from school rather than more work. Any school that makes students participate in extracurricular activites are just being cruel and mean to their students! It's extra curricular and not required curricular.",

    Essay: "What do you do with your time? This year our principal has decided that we all have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. When making this decision the principal didn't hesitate to present her students with a amount of activities they can participate in. So many options include things like participation in any sport, effort on the yearbook, and even just serving on the student council. Deciding that all students have to participate in a extracurricular activity can spark a new interest and can turn into a good tool for improving time management.\n\nA range of interests are found out each day, each sparking in different type of people. Sports, reading, crafts are some of many interests students like to participate in. Many students try to find what their good and what they enjoy. Some don't, a good amount of students don't exactly know what there going to do in the future, many haven't given it a thought. This new rule can spark many new interests to people who expect it the least. You never know if you like it or not if you haven't tried it. This a way many students can find things they would of never tried and advance on doing it all while they enjoy themselves. New hobbies are made and student makes the expectation of the new rule.\n\nSome you are know stranger to procrastination. Procrastination is a form of holding off important things to the very last minute. Phones. Phones have been a big staple in people's efforts and time. Nine out of ten teens have some social media installed on their devices. This whole generation revolves around our prized possession, our phones. When scrolling, tapping, or even watching funny videos time flies. As I was saying earlier this new rule may cause some new interests to spark up. A student may find a interest they want to continue. Now the student can balance their time with an equal portion on every part of their day. A balanced day, if you will.\n\nAt the start if this essay I explained how students could benefit from this rule. Overtime a student many not only find his or her interests but improve a use of their time management skills. Your body needs to get a certain amount of vitamins and foods to function. The same way a student could process better information and do even better in school when their mind ins't always thinking about one certain thing. Broading the minds idea of things could help with time management and the future glide of what the later do in life.",

The principal said that you have to at least do one activity. It is good for you if you stay after school to do activities like sports or work on the year book you can also work on your homework if you need help. It is good for you because you get to learn new things about your school and also can represent your school you can also stay in shape.\n\nMost of the students in the school dont do any thing because they are to lazy or they have to take care of there siblings. For example when I was in fifth grade I had two activates that I did an they were basketball and there was a club named on my road and we did our homework and when we were done we go out side and play sports and each day we had a different sport. I had a lot of fun when I was doing actives after school because I got to get away from my sisters and my mom because my mom always cleans and it annoys me because right when I get back from school my mom says go clean your room, clean the living room, go clean the bathroom and when I am done I barely had time to do my homework.\n\nSome activities can help you in the future because you can get to go to college for free if you are good student and have good grades and know how to play a sport.

    Essay: "Dear students,our dear principal had decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. And frankly I couldnt agree more. The students in our school are paying to much on their phones .All students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they teach you like skills,They help people get people of their phones.\n\nThe first reason all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is that they teach you life skills you need to know. For example If you want to join a sport extracurricular activity i'll us soccer as an example. It teaches you a life skill called team work. In a game you must pass the ball to your teammates and they must also do the same. It is impossible to win a game without working together with your teammates. Let me show you another example with the student council extracurricular activity. It teaches you about different roles you might have and the responsibilities they come with. If your the president you must be responsible and check up on all the other people in the council.\n\nThe last reason all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity is that it gets them off their phones and communicating with other people. This day and age kids would rather be on social media and playing on their phones then be involved in an extracurricular activity and talking to other people. But if all students had to participate in an extracurricular activity then they would have communicate with other people. Communication is very important and the student council extracurricular activity could help people who have troubling communicating . Because the whole point of that extracurricular activity is to communicate and fix problems pertaining to the school.\n\nTo summarize, all students should participate in an extracurricular activity. They are good for student to learn life skills they need for their future. They are also a good way for students to get off from their phones and communicate with other students in our school. If students were required to take an extracurricular activity it would help our school.",

    Essay: "I personally think he is correct. Although i agree with his statement, not all children have to participate in an extracurricular activity, they should be allowed to choose which activities they do, if they wish to do any. I also think they should just enjoy their own hobbies, for example, music is a hobby of mine.\n\nAlright, so let me explain this to you, some kids have special needs and arent able to do such activities. While others already have so much going on in their life and might get sidetracked from choosing an activity. While i understand some just dont want to do the activities, they should not be forced to. I understand that some people love these kinds of activities, however, some cannot do them. I mainly agree because\n\n\"exircise, is a mental health reliever\".\n\nSome kids have certain physical problems,so they should at least be allowed to choose less physically active activities, for example, chess. Chess is a game more for the excirsise of the mind, than the body. Coding is another good one for kids who cant do physical activities. It improves their sense of direction,and quick thinking, at least, that is how i feel about it. Quite frankly,\n\nI understand what this principal is trying to get across , however, he or she may be going about it all wrong.\n\nI personally think the activites that he or she has requested people do, is reasonable. For example, the yearbook club, a nice, peacful club that doesnt require too much physical skill.\n\nI think these kids should be required to do less of the activities, mainly because they have their own hobbies, why shouldnt they get to continue doing them as often as they normally would? I say this mainly because it just makes sense. You know? In a matter of, \"i like to do this over this\". and etc. I personally have a musical hobby. I play guitar, sing, and play a few other instruments that i know alot of young people play. Some people give up on hobbies because they are \"too hard\" or certain quotes like \"it's just not my thing\", i think everyone should always keep trying at their hobbies, even if they are already good at them, or are very bad at them.\n\nI have stated my opinon, now listen reader, i will include bonus information about musical, and genral hobbies, if you don't mind.\n\nThere are alot of hobbies for you to try that are out in the world, some even count as legitimate jobs. I'll give you some examples. Being a guitarist is an exciting thing to do, mainly because other people love to hear it, and once you get the hang of it, it's just so easy to do. Another good hobby is being a singer. While you think it is probably easy to sing, it is actually quite difficult, especially if you are trying to hold a note. It's nowhere near as easy as it looks.\n\nAlright so back to my opinion on the activities, i will now conclude for you, that everyone shouldn't have to do the activities, but overall i get the principals standpoint, so i agree with him/her. However, that does not mean you should go around quoting me, mainly because you should use the words for your own benifit, so with that said, that is my opinion, have a nice day!",

    Essay: "I highly disagree with the principle's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Most extracurricular activities are after school, since during school hours you're learning. Also, it's pretty unfair to force someone into doing something they're not so comfortable doing. Here are some reasons why I chose to not agree with the decision the principle is making.\n\nFor one, some kids get bullied enough during school, why should they stay after just so they can get bullied even more throughout the day? Not all teachers see or hear a kid being bullied, or when an individual bullies another. Which leads to it occuring more frequently. That damages a persons mental health. Being bullied will cause a person to degrade themselves, the person being bullied may even start to bully others, and it could cause the person being bullied to develope some sort of depression. Being bullied is one of the leading causes to suicide. When an individual has depression, it makes them tired or weak. Causing them to lose focus and forget about the work they're doing in class or maybe even lose interest in trying. Then, they'll have all this work piled up, have to stay after school to play a sport or help out with the yearbook, which will put stress onto them, and that's not a good thing. When people get stressed out, they could get sick or have heart failure from their blood pressure getting raised to a certain extent.\n\nAnother reason is that, a lot of kids struggle financially. Some people might not have a way of transportation from school to home. Most parents work throughout the day while their child is at school. People have to make money, and some jobs won't just let you leave. A lot of kid's parents may get off work around 4 or 6pm, but what about the one's that don't get off work until 8 or 9pm? Yes, the school provides transportation with buses, but they only go through certain routes. If your location isn't near your buses route, then they drop you off at a local gas station or store. But, what if you aren't fortunate enough to have a family member come pick you up and bring you home? Some people aren't as lucky.\n\nI can see it now, people will start skipping school if the principle doesn't give them the choice whether they want to stay after school or not. I'm pretty positive that a lot of parents might make the decision of putting their child into homeschooling or choose to put them in a private school, only to do what's best for them and their child. Students willl tend to be more rebellious, just to skip their extracurricular activity or get kicked out of it. Making it to where there's more people who will be in ISS, more distractions in class, making it to where we can't do our work, and the teachers will be piled with stress due to their students rebelling against them. It'll give the school a bad name because of the number of kids getting in trouble, making the school look really bad. Most kids don't even like attending school, what makes you think they will want to stay after for a couple more hours?\n\nHowever, I do believe there are better solutions into getting kids to participate in extracurricular activities. Teachers could try to motivate kids, you could find some well known influencers to try to influence the student body, and also, there is the solution of giving them a choice. I still believe it would be a bad decision to force people into staying after school. I'm aware they have a choice in what activities they could do, but forcing them to pick something isn't okay. Think of what the students want, think of what's best for them. If you tried to motivate the youth, they would be much more easier to cooperate with.",

    Essay: "We all like our free time, right? You would probably be quite upset if you lost a sizable chunk of it. Well, that thought is becoming a striking reality as one of the principal's newest rules seeks to take that exactly that away from us students. He has decided that all students must participate in at least one after-school activity, be it sports, a club, or the council. But this decision is a horrible one! This is an attack on our free time, and should be stopped before it can take root. An idea such as this could have serious consequences on everyone it affects. For example, it hurts our freedom and schedules harshly, it attacks our precious family bonds, and it could even raise crime rates!\n\nFreedom is a very important part of our country. At many points in history, we have fought for it, and not just for our's, but for other country's freedom's as well. It has defined us ever since we gained our own, so why do children get theirs attacked by schools? Schools already limit free time by about six hours, for five days a week. But now the principal is trying to take that number even higher! Students need their free time, it's important to do homework, review what they've learned, or just unwind. But not all of us already have that luxury. Many students already have things to do right after school, like a non-school sports team, an instrument, or some kind of appointment or job that they do. If they have to do something for the school instead of doing what they have planned, it could hurt their motivations and dreams.\n\nFamily is undoubtedly one of the most important things in anyone's lives. They raise us from babies, teach us morals and manners, and support us, even when we're old. The bonds that hold a family together are irreplaceable and therefore, very valuable. That is why it is critical to reinforce these bonds, and not weaken them, yet the new school decree may do just that. One of the best ways to bond is to spend time together. But not spending time with each other may have the opposite effect, in weakening bonds. If an already weakened bond is stretched too thin, it may snap, leaving the bond's holders feeling unwanted in the other's company. The principal's ruling could harshly affect your family, and if it's at a bad time, permanently damage it.\n\nCrime, a thing every non-criminal dislikes. There are many kinds, but are all committed by humans who have chosen to ignore the laws. But healthy adults usually don't randomly become criminals for no reason. Crime breaking as an adult usually evolves from rule breaking as a child or some other kind of influence or trauma. If a child sees a rule as pointless, there is a very high chance for them to ignore it completely, and this can rapidly advance to them breaking lots of rules. A rule that could seem very pointless or unimportant is the new one, about extra-curricular activities. If a child starts not showing up for after school things, in the child's mind it could easily transition to not going to school for days, or even weeks! That is why rules are usually made with careful thought so they are important, and not easily shrugged off that they are pointless or not worth following. This new rule could have an unforeseen consequence of creating more rule breakers, and therefore, possible criminals.\n\nSchool rules are important. They stop us from running wild and doing whatever we want not reprimanded. But when a rule affects a child adversely in many different ways, it is usually best that the rule is revoked, or at least given more thought. Rules that limit freedom are a tense subject, as at what point does it become too many limits? Limiting freedom in school is accepted and understandable, but when school ends, it should be up to us or our parents to decide what we do, not the school. For parents, this could cause a lot of stress, as it can interfere with lots of schedules. For example, a child could come home after school to watch his baby sibling, or do some kind of important chore. But now, parents have to fit their schedules around this new ordinance, and that is unfair to both the parents and the children it affects. Rules in general are very important. They are what keeps our society together, and stops people from doing just whatever they want. But this new school rule is a bad idea. It not only limits our freedom, it could hurt our family bonds, and could even eventually create criminals.",

At Boston collage they have found kids in clubs are more relaxed than kids in no club.

    Essay: "extracurricular Activities\n\nSome principles decide that all of their students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. I agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because of a few reasons. First, all students can get the chance to participate in a sport. And the extracurricular activity you choose to participate in can prepare you for your future.\n\nI think it is important for students to participate in sports because It gets you in better physical shape. And when you are in better shape you feel more confident in yourself which will make you more focused on your goals. And because you believe in yourself and you know you have the strength to keep pushing and you know you can reach those goals. and your heart and the rest of your body will become stronger. Several studies have proven that exercise is good for your mental heath and your hearts health. Which will make you live longer and be happier.\n\neven though the school is making you participate in extracurricular activities you get to choose the extra curricular activity you want to participate in. You get to choose something you are passionate about and you will have fun doing. And it will be great practice if you want to grow up and do that for a living. If you are participating in an extracurricular activity and it is something you want to do when you grow up, you will be way more experienced then everyone else. And when you apply for a job your employer will see that you are more experienced and qualified then everyone else. For example, if I joined the Marine Biology club I would spend years learning and doing things marine biologists would do. So I would be experienced and have more practice then all of the other people who also want to be marine biologists. I will have the upper hand because I already know things they are just starting to learn about.\n\nI agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities. I agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because they can better prepare you for the future and be ahead of everyone else. And participating in sports will make you more confident so you can believe in yourself. Also it is good for your heart and mental health to exercise. That is why I think participating extracurricular activities is so important and so important to students lives.",

    Essay: "Should students participate in sports, work on year book, or serve on student council. Principal asked all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is it a good or bad decision. I think it is a good decision for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because I can learn something new for participate, meet new people during the extracurricular activity, and have a good time.\n\nFirst, if I want to learn something new can get in an activity I don't know how to do or play. Instead of wasting my time in something I already know, I can use it wisely to learn new things. Lets say I don't know how to play chest I can learn how to play that instead of playing other stuff I already know how to play. Its like playing a sport I know the rules to it but don't know how to play.\n\nSecondly, most of the people at school I don't even know. Maybe by joining other extracurricular activity I can meet new people. This reminds me when I was in a new school. The only way to meet new people is to go up to them and talk to them. Now I can just play with them and get to know what they like and other stuff. Some people are really loud,smelly,and even play good at soccer like me something I am in to. Some people are like cheats running to the ball. A lot of people are different at my other school,but in this school people are lovely to others and are kindly to me and everyone. That is how I meet new people.\n\nLast, the last thing people should do is have fun. Enjoy while it last because it could only last a week or two. You see having fun is not only with friends it is how you have fun. It has to be something all of my friends like not just what I like. Something we can all enjoy.\n\nI think adding the extracurricular activity is a great decision to add at school people would enjoy having it. Students will learn something new, meet new people,and have a good time. Should every school have a extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "I disagree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities because those activities require you to stay after school, and some students might have more important tasks to do at their homes. For example, those students might have to baby sit their little siblings while their mom is still at work. I will be going into a few more examples in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe first reason why students shouldn't participate in extracurricular activities is because some might have duties to help out their mother or father. Some of those duties could be making dinner, babysitting, mowing, etc. There will also be many parents who would not want their child doing these extracurricular activities. These duties take up time, and the extracurricular activities and mess with that time.\n\nSecondly, some students might just think it's a waste of time. Doing the yearbook club doesn't really interest many students, saying that the yearbook club just goes around taking photos. Sports doesn't interest many people, due to that the training is difficult and it takes up a lot of time. Serving on the student council is stressful. even though you make minor choices, they don't get that much thought from the school administration. You have all these positions, but what yields from the experience? Not that much.\n\nLastly, some students might just want to have a chill day, and might not want anything to do with extracurricular activities. They don't want the stress from them. They want some time for themselves. These activities take time away from students, and many dislike that. being stressed can make school harder, make you sleep less, and make your over all performance dwindle.\n\nThese are my reasons fro why i disagree with this decision. Some might have curfews, important business, doctors appointments, and much more. Extracurricular activities take up quite an amount of time, and could get in the way. This is why that all students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "Picture this: you are a senior in high school who is taking multiple Advanced Placement (AP) classes. You are unable to attend your dream college because you have not previously participated in one single extracurricular activity. Now, you are very disappointed because you could have done one little thing to eliminate this problem. It may be too late for you, but you could prevent this problem from saddening many more students in the future. Taking up at least one extracurricular activity can benefit you in ways such as finding your passion and morphing your future, so requiring it is a must.\n\nFirst of all, being a part of a club or sports team can result in you finding your love for a specific activity. Personally, I experienced my love for running after joining my middle school's Cross Country team. Also, becoming exposed to many different activities at a younger age helps you decide what you prefer to do and not do. If you already love something not offered as a specific school activity such as photography, you can join the yearbook club at your school to use your talent of taking pictures. Many sports are also not offered, so you could talk to your principal about adding a specific activity to broaden your options.\n\nSecondly, having participated in a school extracurricular could be the difference in attending a specific college or not. The same goes for a desired workplace, as many companies require an extracurricular to be present on your resume. For example, if you participated in your school's drama club in middle school and high school, you are more likely to get into a theater class in college than someone who was not a part of their school drama club. Also, being a part of a club or sport can help you gain social skills, that way if you have to give a talk or write a book with someone, you will be prepared.\n\nWith all that being said, many arguments arise. One popular argument is parents may not have the time to drop their child off at their club. The easy solution to this problem is that schools most likely have at least one after-school club that seems appealing for that child, which is very convenient because your child is at school anyways, so being dropped off is not necessary. Also, if your specific sport or club is not offered at your school, there is a very high chance that someone else does the same activity, and you can carpool together. Another argument is children may not have time to participate in a club due to homework. Because of this argument, many clubs allow you to complete your homework during their session time, or are only about an hour long, still giving you time to finish your homework at home. Lastly, some parents argue that they do not want to pay for their child to do an activity. Although some sports can be pricey, most school activities just have a small registration fee. Some clubs are even free!\n\nTherefore, doing what you love most and becoming a good employee both are a result of extracurricular activities. If that is going to be the case, why not require it? Although some good arguments arise, even better solutions rise higher. Do not let the absence of one activity ruin your academic dream. Overall, extracurricular activities help more than hurt, so add something fun to your schedule and receive the benefits of taking a little bit of time out of your day to unwind.",

    Essay: "The principal's proposal has its benefits, but it could also lead to a number of problems. Kids go to school everyday for a number of hours, working away to meet their academic goals. They are then sent home with numbers upon numbers of worksheets, math problems, study guides, essays, and other homework items. While some kids are used to dividing their time for school and extracurricular activities like sports or clubs, others are not. Making after school activities a requirement will take a toll on a lot of student's after school lives for the following reasons.\n\nOf course, their are age limits and requirements for driving. So, when kids are able to transport themselves to their activities, they look to their parents for a lift. Since parents are busy caring for their families, most go to work or work from home to earn money. Different jobs have different time frames so adding a mandatory activity to some families schedules could interfere with parent's work. A lot of parents get home late from work, meaning kids could have no way to get to their activity before then. If a child cannot get to their activity due to lack of transportation, there is an obvious problem, which will be hard to solve without complicating other family member's plans.\n\nAnother possible issue is lack of interest in the available extracurricular activities. There are only a number of activities a kid can sign up for and do in their area, so what happens if none of them spark an interest? Children are sent to school for a majority of the day, doing their school work, which most students don't seem to enjoy. Having them sign up for an activity they don't really like could turn what is supposed to be fun into a chore. Kids would be dragging on through the day, from one boring thing to the next, as they watch the clock until they are sent home. A lot of children are most likely going to be tired after hours of work at school, so requiring each of them to get home, with possibly little to no time to rest before getting ready for an activity they don't want to do could do damage on the child's mental and physical strength.\n\nA sensitive topic to some families is money. Schools and peers never know how a family is doing with financial stability. While some families could spend with little worries on savings, others could be living their lives paycheck to paycheck, with just enough money to send their children to school, pay for a house and put food on the table. Sometimes, the current situation a family is in limits their ability to spend, and extracurricular activities often cost money. Whether the costs are on gear, supplies, or even gas for transportation to these events, some families simply cannot earn the money to pay for these things. Nobody deserves to feel pressured due to this new school rule. Adding this requirement could urge parents to have to work another job, or limit spending on other needs like food or a house to pay for whatever is needed for a child's activity. If there is absolutely no way for a family to pay for a sport, club, etc, having the school or the child's friends find out they cannot pay could lead to feelings of embarrassment and sometimes jealousy of people with more money.\n\nAdding after school activities as a requirement could help kids get out more, exercise, and other benefits, but the bad outweighs the good. I believe families should not feel pressured to change their lives so their kids could go to their activity. Students must balance school work on top of possible family issues and other things, so if families can take them to an after school activity, then that's great, but if they can't then they shouldn't be forced to. Transportation, lack of interest, and money are just some possible issues with the principals new idea, along with others, like stress, possible injuries, etc. Schools should stick to educating our future adults, and leave the rest to the families of the children.",

    Essay: "Would it be better if students had at least one extracurricular activity? Yes a activity benefits a student very much. A activity like a sport can improve teamwork, physical health, and grades.\n\nHaving schools make the student patricipate in atleast one school activity is a great idea. A activity with more than one person in it can help teamwork. The students would learn that it is better to do things together as a team. For example soccer,in soccer you can either take the ball up the field and get the ball taken away by the opposite team or you can pass the ball to your teamates and make a goal. This is why having a activity is a good idea to make students do.\n\nA extracurricular activity is good for students because it can improve physical health. Playing a sport can improve your endurance and strength. playing track can improve how long you can run. At the start of track you of only run a mile and at the end of track you could of ran 5 miles. Then when u come to gym and do the pacer you would be able to get a better grade because you can run faster and longer without getting tired.\n\nFinally, a extracurricular activity can improve your grades. A club can help your grades alot. If you were to join something like a math club you could as the members for help and if they dont know something they can ask you for help. This would benefit all the club members in it. then when they come to school the next day you be way ahead of your classmates and get a good grade on all your subjects\n\nThis is why it is good for students to have a extracurricular activity at the school.",

As an eighth grader in middle school, having a lot of homework, working on projects, and studying is already a lot, and adding a sport to that would be more stressful. We all can relate to being stressed and pressured. Which is why I disagree that students must participate in a extracurricular activity because, it can be stressful on some students, students have other activities outside of school, and lastly students should be able to make their own choices.\n\nSome students come home with so much work that needs to get done, and that alone can be very stressful.

All that stress could lead to sleeping problems or worse, which could interfere with a students performance at school.\n\nNot all students have the time to stay after school. Many students may have other activities outside of school, that can already be tough on them. Students might already have a sport they play outside of school they need to attend.

To make a new club a student has to have at least six students that want to join the club but there also has to be one adult supervising the students.

    Essay: "When you join an extracurricular activity there's no telling what you can do! You could pass that test,win the football game or you could even make a new friend. Yes, the possibilities are endless when you join an extracurricular activity. But some people think that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time and that they don't really matter in the life.\n\nBut I think extracurricular activities contains many benefits to the typical school student. Such as, fitting in better at school,making new friends,and even improving your grades.\n\nWhen you're in an after school club you'll fit in better by joining the club that best suits you. You can do what you enjoy best while even meeting new students and getting to know them as well. Meeting people that share the same interests as you, will most definitely help you fit in the school. Being the new student in school is scary and stressful. But if you join an after school club then you will definitely fit in better at the school.\n\nJoining an after school club is a great way to be with your friends more and make new friends at the same time. School doesn't have to be the limit when it comes to being with your friends. And when you both join the same club you could spend more time together while doing your favorite things. Such as, being in the same team in a sport or acting in the theater. You and your friend could make new friends and hang out as a group.\n\nIf fitting isn't an issue then maybe your grades are. Joining in after school activities could improve your grades on certain subjects that you're struggling on.\n\nJoining in these clubs could significantly improve your grades and help you better understand the subject. And if you do understand the subject then maybe you could help the other students that could still have trouble understanding. Not only would your grades improve but everybody else's that got your help.\n\nIn conclusion, I think everybody should join an extracurricular activities since it has many benefits to the average student. Participating in these activities could help you fit in better at school by being part of a group in a school like being in the chess club or football team. Being in these activities could also give you the opportunities to make new friends by meeting new people that share the same interests as you do. Joining these clubs could also give you the chance to bring your grades up and help you pass that test. So yes, I think everybody should join an extracurricular activities since it has many benefits for the students and the teachers.",

    Essay: "What's even more boring than school? Homework? Afterschool activities? Well yes, Afterschool activities are super boring and they shouldn't have them for schools. People think that first doing school is boring enough, but doing afterschool activities is probably the WORST idea ever because you have to do even more work. I believe that we shouldn't have afterschool activities because it makes things even worse than usual.\n\nOne reason why schools shouldn't have afterschool activities, is because it's is extremely exhausting. As I was walking out to do bus duty, I heard a student say, \"I have practice tonight, but I'm super tired and I want to lay down and take a nap\", says Generic_Name, 8th grade Dean of Generic_school.\n\nA second reason why schools shouldn't have afterschool activities is because it's a waste of time. Students have reported that they have a big MASTERY test the next day and they have to go to practice so they don't have much time to be able to study for the test the next day.\n\nSome people argue that doing afterschool activities are actually really fun, because \"You can hang out with friends and not have to do homework right away\", says Generic_school of the Institute of National Athletics and Sports. However, doing afterschool activities is really annoying because \"people that are really tired and don't want to go to practice or their sport, and want to go lay down and take a nap on their bed\", says researcher Ethan Adams of the Institute of afterschool programs.\n\nI believe that all schools shouldn't have afterschool activities because it's extremely exhausting, and it's a waste of time. I would think twice about signing up for afterschool activities because you might want to change your mind and then not do it.",

    Essay: "Imagine that all your rights are taken away and you have to work for your entire life. Forcing kids to do after school activates is like that. Students should have freedom of what they do after school,also they might already be in after school classes or they might not like the programs that they offer. Whatever the reason is students should not be forced to do any activities after school.\n\nStudents should the right to do what they want to do after school. You see if they want to go home after a long tired day at school they should go home. Forcing to participate in after school curricular actives will just increase stress and misery on the student,nothing will be accomplished from this. Students might have other things to do like chores are just talking to there relatives or some other thing that they might have in there life. Young people come here to learn that it, they have there life. School is school not a prison.\n\nMany students go home take eat a snack and go participate in the sport or activate they already do outside of school. A decent amount of students already do extra curricular activates outside of school. Making everyone to participate a in an activity in school would be a punishment. The people who already do activities will have a major bust up in there schedule which will cause lots of problems to them. Also the students who are not in after school activities will eventually find something to do maybe in school or something to do when they get home.\n\nSure the school system does offer a variety of extra curricular activities so people can participate in. However out of all the programs some students might not want to join. They just might not be interested to go in the activity,or they might have tired one or two classes and they might have found apathy for it. Some kids might just want to be at home and relax so and dont work themselves too much in school or school-like activities.\n\nStudents should certainly not be forced into after school activities. There are many reasons and who knows what in whos life. It is important to not overwhelm students with these activities. Though it is important to do fun activities on your own or in a group but it is something that shouldn't be don't with pressure. Think about you do all this effort in school and you want to leave and relax,but with after school activities you can't. This is why students should always have a choice in everything and with case they should not be forced to do after school actives.",

    Essay: " Mom i'm getting very stressed out with all this work that i'm being assigned,\" says Generic_Name. Her mom replies to her saying, \"You should try doing an after school sport or activity which will teach you new skills, or allow you to express yourself.\" Many students may be enrolled in rigorous classes in school giving them a great deal of stress and anxiety, but if they were required to take an extracurricular they would be able to relieve there stress in a safe and productive environment. A survey shows that seven out of ten students feels he or she is getting a great amount of work and are feeling stressed, and they support the idea of having after school activities to express themselves. Students should be required to take extracurricular activities because they give them the opportunity to express themselves, they can learn new skills, and find passion in an area that they discover.\n\nFirst off, students find after school activities as a great way to express themselves in a way they would not be able to in a regular classroom. Many students can join a fine arts club or a sports team where they could collaborate with others who enjoy those areas. For example, my friend Generic_Name had been in many advanced classes and was receiving a heavy work load, wanting a way to get rid of his stress he joined the track team. Before he had joined the track team he was always tired and anxious, but once he began running he was happy and was not as stressed as before. This shows that he was able to join a sports team that allowed him to express himself and create a love for a sport while also relieving his stress. To elaborate, my brother had always had anxiety about his grades and what tests he had the next day. He had always been into art, so he had decided to join the art club, when he had done this he would always come home and talk about how great it was that he had the freedom to paint whatever he had wanted and not have to worry about memorizing facts. Ultimately, this allowed his brain to think more creatively and gave him a break from memorizing facts for his test.\n\nSecondly having students join after school activities may allow them to find skills that they possess in an area that they have not yet discovered. This is important because many students may only know about their skills that are taught in a classroom for a specific subject, rather than finding skills they hadn't known they had in a topic not taught in classrooms. One example, would be my father who had never taken any extracurricular activities which had lead him to think the only skills he had were those that were taught in the classroom. Once he had gotten to high school it was recommended to take one or more clubs, so he had decided to take a computer class. When he had finished the year, he had realized that he had a skill in working with computers and that their were other skills to be learned other than those taught in classrooms. This is important because it had created new job opportunities for him, and allowed him to discover skills he thought he never had. Furthermore, I can relate to this because I had allows thought that math and science were my only strengths and skills. This was the case because I had never really wanted to join an after school activity because I had thought they were a waste of time, until I had decided to take a stock market club which made a huge impact on my life. It was very important because I earned a passion for it and to this day I am still intrigued by the topic.\n\nLastly, students will have the opportunity to create a passion for the area that they discover, or have it become a hobby of theirs. This could be important because it would allow students to create a love for it early in their life making it easier for them to pursue that career later in their life. For example, one of my older friends Generic_Name had chosen to be in a club where they volunteer with children because he thought it would be an easy club participate. A couple weeks in he began to fall in love working with children, and had thought about working with children when he grew up. When he had gotten older and completed college, he started working at a day care. This shows the importance of finding hobbies when you are younger which may help find your career path. To add on, my mother when in school was required to take a real estate class which taught her many skills and gave my mom a small passion for real estate, this however did not influence her career path, but it had given her a drive to one day be able to work in real estate. After she had finished college she went on to work a job she had gotten from her degree, however since she had loved real estate so much she began doing it over the weekends and gave her two sources of income. Having taken that class gave her a love and drive for an area she may not have discovered if not being required to take that class.\n\nIn conclusion students should be required to take after school activities. Since Generic_Name's mom persuaded her to join a club, she had decided to join drama. When she came home Generic_Name said to her, \"The drama club is so much fun because I wasn't worried about school, instead we were all singing and having fun, I can't wait to go back tomorrow and do it again.\" Because clubs allow students to learn new skills, express themselves, and find hobbies in areas they discover, Students should be required to take extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "Yes, I do agree with this decision, it is important that you are bringing yourself into the school more by doing at least one extracurricular activity. I think this is important because if you are a student at a school you should be engaged to that school in and outside of school hours. I mean one extracurricular activity is not that much to bear with, it could be really fun , you could play sports, you could do the yearbook, and you can even serve on the student council. If I were a principal at a school I would encourage this rule too because I would want kids to have fun in school not just learn and do things that are required. I would want to show the students that school is not something that you should dread, but it is something that you should take advantage of and use it everytime you can. I know that students just want to get back home right after school hours but they do not realize that they can stay after and have so much fun doing activities and bonding with other students that also are doing the activities with you. After school activities can be really fun, you can sign up for a once a year sports competition that our school does like the flag football tournament. The flag football tournament was so fun for every one of the students that signed up for it. Like I said it should not be something that you dread, it should be something that you want to do often. I know a lot of students are really upset about this new rule because they do not like doing things with other people that often, but once they start doing it and meeting students that you have never spoken to before everything starts to become fun and exciting.\n\nStudents are constantly on their phones and their games that they forget all about all the fun you could be having off phones and screens. Some students are in such a rush to finish school to go home back to their screens when they could be hanging out with their friends after school and before school. I think extracurricular activites are great opportunities to be bonding with new people and making friends. As an example, I did not have too many friends back in 7th grade but after I started going to after school activities such as weight lifting and other clubs, I have been doing a great job making friends and actually have a nice social life now. I am just saying this new rule that you have to do one extracurricular activity is going to help a lot of people that are struggling with making friends and talking to new people. After this year they are going to love our principal for deciding this for everyone. Students are going to be hanging out with their new friends that they met in after school activities and they are going to look back and wonder, what would have happened if this were never a rule. I just want kids that do not have many friends to meet new people and future friends for themselves.\n\nI used to struggle making friends and talking to new people, but some of these extracurricular activites made me feel better about myself and less insecure. It was a lot of great experiences for me and I just want everyone that was in my position to feel the same way I do right now, that is why I am agreeing on this idea. I do not want any kids to suffer or be shy, I want them to meet new people and make friends during these extracurricular activities. I just agree with this so much because this is how you meet and bond with new people, I feel like a lot of students need one extracurricular activity. For example I know a student that is not that very social and is struggling to make new friends other than myself, I told him that he should go to some after school activities to meet other students and make new friends. The next day he went weight lifting with me and he met some new people and now he has more friends. I just want this opportunity to be taken advantage of by some students. This is why I agree with the idea of making students take at least one extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "Participating in extracurricular activities at school is something most people do when they are in middle school, high school, or even college. While most people already do a sport or a club of some sort most of the kids don't do anything extra with their school. When doing extra activities many people will probably meet new friends or just simply talk to different people that are outside of their normal friend group or comfort zone. Doing different activities can help out your school and surrounded communities that are in need of some help. Giving students something to do outside of school can really help a child learn and develop new skills that they didn't know they had before. Having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school is a good idea because it can give the students something to do after school, help out their school and community a little, and even make and or meet new friends.\n\nTo begin, when students aren't at school they are probably playing on their phones or electronic devices. So, by having them doing something fun that isn't just school work or homework could benefit each student in many different ways. One way is just not having them sit on their butts all day doing absolutely nothing like they would normally do after school. Acting like a pig all hours of the day. It could also get them healthy, by losing weight and gaining muscle at the same time. A child could be a little over weight and by giving them some type of physical activity it could change their world around from what it was to what it is now. Doing each different activity could teach a kid many different skills that they didn't known they had before and could one day even develop into they future career. By teaching one child something they could then go and teach maybe a hundred of other students the same skill they learned from someone else and change the world for them. Then, the cycle will just keep repeating itself again and again until that job is no longer needed in society.\n\nAnother reason, why forcing students to do a extracurricular activity is that they would be helping out their school in many different ways. If they played any type of sport they could help win a game or a contest of some sort that is not only a sport, it could be a science fair projector a club project. The more and more school functions that the students go to the more they will begin to like high school and want to go to everything that is possible to go to. Their school spirit would start to shine through at school and then later into sport games and pep rallies and just simple daily life. Depending on what activity they chose they could start to clean up outside and inside the school. They could create new and better ideas for not only the school but the surrounding communities and even all over the world. They could help out the local communities that might need help at the time from just a simple fix or all the way up to a disaster of some sort.\n\nBy doing this, the school would start to feel more beautiful and look even more beautiful on the inside and out.\n\nLastly, when someone is in any type of activity whether it be dance or music classes or school activities you are always going to be meeting new people from not only the same school but other schools or even states to. By doing any of those activities listed above you are somehow and somewhere going to break out of your shell at some point. Whether it be a tiny step of even a gigantic step that you didnt see coming or even notice. By getting out of your comfort zone you may feel more comfortable around other people that you didn't used to feel comfortable around before all of the school activities were started. You may then want to do more activities at your school and all other the reasons that are listed above will start to shine though and you may start to become a whole new person. You may meet new friends and other friendships will form, and change many different things about your life and how it was going to play out before all of the school activities were started.\n\nIn conclusion, having to do a school activity would be a great thing for almost all types of schools and students around the world to start doing. Giving the students something to do outside of school can get them fit and healthy along with many other positives to that. When helping out their school they can show off the school spirit and love that each student is being to have for their school. While doing all of those things you are sure to make a friend or two along the way that will help get you out of your own comfort zone and do the path of life with. Giving students something to do, helping out their school to some degree, and meeting or making new friends along the way are all good reasons why making sure that every student does one type of school activity throughout the year. Without having some sort of activity outside of school most students would just be like a whole bunch of dirty slobs that eat and go to school.",

After that, you just might have a new friend.\n\nStudents could join a extracurricular activity because they need a hobby. Students who don't have any activities to do after-school should sign up for a sport or club because they could become really interested in it and keep doing that activity throughout the school year.

If you have a small friend group and want to expand, joining a club and/or sport would be a good option because there's always teamwork involved.

    Essay: "Would you want to be forced to do an extracurricular activity? It would not make any sense for our principle to force everyone to do an activity after school. It should be our choice on whether or not we want to do one or not. Also for some kids it may be hard to fit one into their schedule, they may not have transportation to and from the activity, or they could just not want to do an extra activity.\n\nFirst, some kids might have to do things after school that wouldn't leave any time for an extracurricular activity. They may have to take care of younger siblings while their parents are at work. They could even have a job that doing an extra activity would make them late to. Also we have tons of homework every night that we have to do that takes up a lot of time. Basically many kids have way more important things to do and cannot make time for an extra activity\n\nSecond, transportation home from the activity may be a struggle for many kids. They could have parents that work so they would have no way to get home. Most parents are not out of work until hours after their children get home off the bus. Having to stay after school and not take the bus home would leave many kids without a ride back to their house.\n\nLast, doing an extracurricular activity could not be in the interest of a lot of kids. They could be exhausted from a long day of school and just want to go home and rest. They could also not have much athletic ability that would make it harder for them to do a sport. As far as student council, yearbook, or other after school activities like those, although those things may be interesting to some students, they are definitely not to everybody.\n\nIn conclusion, our principle should not force us to do an extracurricular activity. It is time consuming, forces everyone to have to find a way home from school other than the bus, and may not be what everyone wants to do. We should have a choice on whether or not we do an extra activity. We are old enough to make our own choices and we dont need our principle to be telling us what to do inside and outside of school.",

    Essay: "Students should not be required to do a extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities are time consuming and not all students have that time. If the student has a job that is very time consuming and not understanding at all then they could possibly lose their job. Losing a job is very bad considering it's already extremely hard to find a job and on top of that they lose their source of income. If the student is making money to help out with bills or buying food they can't anymore because they dont have a source of income.\n\nWhen students start doing extracurricular activities then they start to lose time with family and loved ones. When the students start losing time with family it can impact them mentally. If their family member is sick or is hardly home and they miss out on getting to see them, that can be very hard on that person. If the student has sibling they need to watch or take care of they can't anymore because they aren't home, having to do something else they might not even like. What if the student can't get rides from their family they can't just keep borrowing rides from other people\n\nStudent might have family that run a business that the are required to work at. when the student has to start doing other things like sports and clubs, they won't be able to work and help out as much with the family business anymore. This is why i think it is a bad idea to make it mandatory for students to do extracurricular activities. It will cause problems in the students life that wouldn't be there otherwise.

    Essay: "Many students today do not participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are very common, but many kids do not participate in them. Participating in extracurricular activities has many different benefits and can help a student in many different ways. After school activities should be required in every school. Extracurricular activities can benefit a student in many ways it can teach students responsibility, it can help students make new friends, and can help students gain a hardworking mindset.\n\nFor example, learning how to be responsible is a life lesson everyone will need. Therefore, students should be required to participate in some type of after school activity because while participating in a sport you have to be responsible enough to have all your equipment ready for your practice so you are prepared. Participating in a club will also teach a student responsibility because the student will be responsible of knowing when and where the meeting is. Another big responsibility students will have while participating in extracurricular activities is time management. While participating in other things besides school being a good student will always be first. Students will have to be responsible in managing their time right so that you will still have time to complete their homework and any other things while still practicing daily for their upcoming games or being active in their club.\n\nAnother reason extracurricular activities are beneficial to students is because students will have a chance to meet new friends. Many kids find it difficult to step outside their comfort zone and meet new friends. Clubs and Sports can help students meet lifelong friends. Personally I have met some of my closest friends on a softball field or in beta club. Extracurricular activities can help these kids fell less overwhelmed about making new friends while also participating in after school activities.\n\nLastly, after school activities can benefit a student by helping them gain a hardworking mindset. In sporting activities athletes always want to be able to beat there competition but to do this they have to have a hardworking mindset. Athletes also always want to be one of the best on the team but to do that each individual athlete will have to have a hard work ethic to practice, study the game, and improve. A hardworking mindset can also be gained in clubs because while participating in a club you want to be able to win at any of the competitions you participate in but to do so, you have to work to improve and work to be the best. A hardworking mindset will also be beneficial in the classroom because hopefully students will have that same mindset towards improving and getting good grades. Overall a hard work ethic will always be needed to accomplish any goals in life.\n\nIn conclusion after school activities should be required. kids can learn responsibility, meet new friends, and gain a hardworking mindset all while participating in after school activities and being active. Participating in at least one after school activity should be required in all schools. After school activities will always be beneficial in many different ways, whether you are participating in a sport or a club it will still be very beneficial to a student.",

Not only are extracurricular activities very fun things to do, they also give the kids something to look forward to, provide the students some social time, and give them a community to be a part of.\n\nBy the end of the day, the students are usually tired from their long day of work, but they usually don't feel that way when they have a fun activity to look forward to. The extracurricular activity is like the light at the end of a tunnel. It'll help them make it through the slow and long day of school.\n\nThroughout the years, teen's social skills have decreased because of things like cellphones and technology, but if the kids have an extracurricular activity where they have to put down their phones, they'll have to socialize. During the extracurricular activity, they'll get to make new friends and strengthen their friendship with preexisting friends. Sometimes, kids will talk during the school day because they feel like they have no other chance to talk to their friends, but if you give them an extracurricular activity where they have a guarantee of being able to talk to their friends, there won't be as many chatty kids in the middle of class.\n\nFinally, this will give them a community. There are kids who don't feel like they fit in. They feel isolated and not connected to anyone at their school.

    Essay: "Often times, students are staying home or doing homework and it can get boring. Students should have something to look forward to, like playing on the school basketball team, or playing the violin! They should have a special time to learn something new or keep practicing something they enjoy. Sometimes, they might not even realize that they enjoy something before they try it. I have my own experience, When I was in 6th grade, I was against the idea of any kind of sport and all I wanted to do was draw and play video games. I was uncomfortable with myself and I went to the doctor. The doctor then proceeded to tell me that doing a sport would help me. I was upset at first when I started tennis and now it's my favorite sport. I want to inspire students by having every one of them participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It is an excellent idea, and it would be very beneficial to students.\n\nHealth and Mindset improvement\n\nMany students have unhealthy eating habits and a lack of exercise that has a drastic impact on students. Most children with unhealthy eating habits and a lack of physical activities are unhappy because they lack endorphin. Encouraging students to pick a sport can help one make healthier choices or get into better mindset to try new things and make new friends. Trying new activities can help you find new interests and is another way to improve your mental health because you have something to look forward to. Being bored is another cause of an unhealthy life style. If you're always bored that means you almost never have anything to do. Most of the time when people are bored it makes people sad. But you can prevent that by participating in an activity. It is also beneficial because you discover new experiences and learn from your mistakes which leads to potential character development.\n\nStudents can make new friends\n\nFor some students, making friends can be very difficult. They may feel lonely or excluded from things because they don't have many friends. They also may not have anyone to hang out with them outside of school. However, when you join a club or extracurricular activity it is much easier to make friends because you are surrounded by peers who share similar interests with you and are easier o talk to because of that. Trusted adults are very important for an individual to have because without one, you don't have an experienced individual to consult when you have issues like bullying, home life, school, or if you just need someone to talk to. Most extracurricular activities have an adult running them like a Coach, Teacher, or a Parent that could be a wise individual to talk to when you have a problem. Some students do not have good role models at home and Trusted adults may also be a good individual to follow.\n\nStudents may learn new skills or improve at what they're good at\n\nWhen people hear something they think they dont like, their first reaction would be negative. I think students should be pushed out of the \"It doesn't look fun so I don't like it\" mindset. It is an obstacle to trying new things and will never help the student. Trying new things can unleash new interests and will help a student with their life path because it will be easier to pick a college major, job, or elective. That is very important because many students when they have graduated high school don't know what they want to employ as. Therefore, it wastes time that the student can be using for college, university or employment. A student can continue an extracurricular activity that they are good at and it will help them improve at that skill. Most professional athletes, Artists, and Musicians have been practicing since childhood and that is how they became a professional. And students can accomplish that too if they try their best and join an activity.\n\nOverall, students learn an abundance of skills while doing extracurricular activities like, communication skills, healthy habits, time management, creative and critical thinking and many more. There is no harm in trying new things. So, why not join an extracurricular activity today?",

    Essay: "So we heard that our principal is going to let all the students to participate in one activity of their choice. But I have both reasons that might go alright or not. Lets just say if I agree or disagree with the principal decision and hopefully that our principal has a good feeling about this decision.\n\nLets start with a positive reasons. First responsibility, if the students get a activity that takes a lot of serious responsibility like for example serve on the student council or working on the yearbook, activity like that those have real responsibility to take care of. Next is not knowing it was the students talent, all activity will fill up very quickly and if any teacher puts a student that is not their favorite class they will notice that their very talented on a activity that they didn't like. Last positive reason overwhelmed, the student will get overwhelmed and sometimes is alright but at the end they still love the class.\n\nSecond, start with the negative reasons. It won't be their favorite if a student want to be a class so bad but then a teacher decides to put him/her to different class it's likely that the student wont be liking the class not a bit. Overwhelming, it's going to the same thing but the opposite its almost the same topic as the last reason of not liking the class and overwhelmed is the part cause of not liking the class which lead to our third last negative reason, dropping out its most likely that they gonna drop out the class it will get so stress and overwhelmed that the student decides to quit and that lead to have a no responsiblilty in life.\n\nSo I do agree with principal student or people need to have responsibility in life and without it theres going to be no job for that person who decided to drop of the activity they got asigned.",

Why should teens know team work skills because having team work skills will help them in a long way, like an example a football teams, if on one isn't lessening to no one then there team will probably lose every signal game, the reasoning is that, no one has team work skills.

    Essay: "Participation in Extracurricular Activities\n\n\"Click, click.\" That is the sound of a camera being pressed in yearbook club. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can learn new skills, make new friends, and it is a way to use up time.\n\nStudents can learn a lot of new skills. If a student has never even touched a camera, they can learn. The student could be in photography club and now have a great picture taking technique. Being in a extracurricular activity will surely improve their social skills. They will be able to hang out with kids who have the same interests as them. Another reason is that your kid might even be the best kicker to ever kick but they have no idea how to play soccer. Enrolling them in the sport is a good way for them to make use of their talent. Children can discover new skills everyday, so helping them master it in extracurricular activities will help them be successful.\n\nJoining an activity after school is a great way to make new friends. Students will be with people who share the same interests as them. Their current friends might not understand their passion for certain things. Doing something they love will people who also love it will make it a better experience. Experiencing something with someone who can't appreciate it would not be fun. Sometimes students don't have any friends within their class. Making friends with kids who they don't have to see everyday would be nice for them. Students in activities will make long lasting friendships and be able to express themselves.\n\nHowever, sometimes it might seem like a hassle just to get to the activities. Having to get back to school from home would be hard for most families. This is why they set up a system where the students can stay at school until their activity is over and then get picked up by their parents or get dropped off by a late school bus. This way, parents don't need to stress about getting them back to school. The school cares very much about the students and wouldn't want them to feel left out if they can't get a ride.\n\nStudents should all be enrolled in extracurricular activities for various reasons.

    Essay: "Having students participate in extracurricular activities has many bonuses and downfalls. I agree with my principal on making all students participate in at least one extra circular activity because they could discover a new hobby they like, it would help to keep kids out of trouble, and it would help to better kids knowelege on working together.\n\nWhen students are in their adolescence stage they are finding who they truly are. Extracurricular activities are a great way for young students to find things that they are good at and what they enjoy. After school clubs have a huge variety of options based on things you like. They have options from sports to arts such as soccer, basketball, yearbook, serving on the student council, and many more. With all of these options, young students are almost certain to find a hobby or sport that they enjoy and are good at.\n\nStudents of all ages learn things about morals and doing the right thing all the way up to college, and even after that. Extracurricular activities play a big role in shaping the way students act and behave in a positive way. If students do not have the best household life, their after school activity would act like an escape, where they are thought how to be a better citizen and how to help people out who need it. Typically, extracurricular activities happen about 3 times a week, this is not only a way to get students minds to go away from hardships in their lives, it also keeps them out of trouble.\n\n\"Teamwork makes the dream work.\"\n\nThis statement is very true, but sadly, some students have never had the chance to truly work together as or on a team using teamwork. I believe that teamwork is a very important skill to have. In extracurricular activities, working in a team is one of the most important tasks that I constantly see. Weather that be in sports passing the ball, in yearbook discussing who will do what spread and what will it be on, or even on the student council talking about things that they would like to see and communicate on how to get it done. There is no doubt that in any extracurricular club you will not use teamwork skills to work with each other and learn valuable life skills.\n\nAfterschool clubs and extracurricular activities teach you so many great life skills and are a great use of time. I would agree very strongly that all students should have to take at least one amazing extracurricular activity in their life to better enhance their lives with so much knowelege and so many valuable skills and morals.",

    Essay: "Firstly, I disagree because some kids around here may not have the money to do a sport, when you do a sport you have to buy the pants,shoes,the shirt everything that goes with that sport you'll need to buy for the activity or sport. But I do recommend trying to find something to do out of school so your not In your house all day long,but do something that you don't have to pay for, for example help out with a church group or ask people to walk there dogs stuff like that. Anyways i disagree most families out here in the real world don't have much money to spend money on everything your going to need for that activity that your going to do,now if you talk to the school or a teacher an tell them that you really would like to try this sport or this activity maybe they'll help you out with paying for the things but most of the time schools aren't very good with helping you with things like that.\n\nSecondly, some kids may have to watch there brother or sister because there parents have to work or just maybe they only have one mom or just one dad. We never know what might happen if we leave them at their house by themselves. For example one time when I use to live In this big white house when I was younger my mom left to go work so I decide to go to a friends place that wasn't very far from my house so I left them there by themselves,my friend decide to pull up a stop sign but I wasn't involved someone saw her do it an called the cops on us,next thing you know the cops was there then I got in trouble because I've left my brother and sister at home with no one there to watch them. So thats why students should have a choice to not do a sport or a activity, so they don't have to leave their siblings at there house by themselves.\n\nfinally, most kids like sports and doing fun activities but I've known some kids and people that don't like to do sports or fun activities. The reason Is I've seen kids get Into big fights over who's going to go first an this an that,thats part of the reason some kids don't get out much to do things but the other reason Is maybe they feel like they'll get judge by what they look like or how they dress trust me i understand that problem. The other thing is sometimes kids have to get a job to help pay bills and get food on the table because there mother Isn't making much money so they have to go get a job and help there mother with stuff they need. People all around the world have to do these things It's sad that they have to but they got to do what they have to do.

    Essay: "Imagine if someone decided school is now nine or ten ours long instead of the traditional seven hours, because that is what it sounded like to the students that attend my school when our principle announced all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with making it mandatory that all students must participate in an activity after school. Students in low income families often do not have the required finances nor time it takes to participate, additionally the stress can easily overload students of all grade levels.\n\nMany low income families can't meet the requirements for an extracurricular activity. Almost all activities require parents to buy materials such as uniforms or supplies that can quickly add up to hundreds of dollars. Even if the school offered to pay for the requirements, you would be taking away money from more academic uses such as field trips or classroom supplies. A doctors appointment alone costs families an obnoxious amount of money but when a student has to receive an updated physical and the needed vaccines annually before they can participate in any physical activity it can quickly become an unrealistic goal. Accidents always happen and if a student was to get injured how would a lower class family be able to pay for the necessary treatment? Not getting immediate medical attention for broken bones or sprained ankles can leave people in severe pain for the rest of their lives, this leaves a huge liability for the school. Parents could easily sue the school for the medical treatment, once again that is money that could be going towards academic advancements. Transportation is another thing many students do not have access to. In a home where parents work low income jobs they often can't take time off of work to pick up their child from school, because of this many students would be forced to ride a bike or walk home which can become a safety hazard.\n\nOlder students often work at after school jobs and must complete several chores at home, this can make an extracurricular impossible to attend. Trying to balance school and a job is already hard to balance but when you add an extra activity on top of that leaves you with no time for a personal life. Free time is usually spent with family and friends, and when you take away that free time relationships can be strained or ruined. Not only does this directly affect the students but it can also hurt an entire family. I often have to babysit my younger siblings so they would have no where to stay while I was gone.\n\nStress is a growing problem for students at my school, including myself. Parents often pressure their kids into making straight A's and achieving that is already a stressful goal but when you add an after school activity it can severely damage a students mental health. Most teachers assign homework and balancing that alone is difficult but after requiring an extracurricular leaves very little time for the additional work. School is around seven hours long meaning children as young as five years old are required to sit at a desk for seven hours each day, five days a week. When school is over students want to be able to go home and relax, not participate in another two hour activity. This can leave them exhausted which affects their overall mental and physical health.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with making it mandatory that all students must participate in an activity after school. Students in low income families often do not have the required finances nor time it takes to participate, additionally the stress can easily overload students of all grade levels.",

    Essay: "Early in the morning, in a class room flooding with students. The announcements start and the principles voice seeps into the ear's of the children mentioning that he will make every student to attend in a extracurricular activity. For example band, art, sports, and many more.\n\nI personally agree with the principle over making every student in our school go to an elective, because the activities in the electives are fun. When I play in band I'm always having a good time ether playing my instrument or talking to my peers. You can also have an entertaining time by playing sports like soccer or foot ball which are always fun to play. Otherwise you can also be in the school council and help students with their problems which could put a grin on your face after you receive a warm \"thank you\" from the students you helped. when it comes to electives fun isn't everything but it is a large part of the experience.\n\nElectives also help in our teamwork and friendship skills. when you first go to your electives room you might some people but there will probably be some one in that room that you don't know. So that would be the best time for you to make a new friend. When your in band your music is supposed to sound like it was coming from one big instrument which sound together and complete. To do this you need team work, when you play your instrument while listening to the people around you so that you can sound like a band. Maby your interested in a sport, but without team work the team wont work. While in these extracurricular activities you should focus on both team work and friendship while also focusing in what your being taught or told to do.\n\nWhen the principle told us to pick a elective because we had to do at do least one, he was basically asking us to pick another class. So we are still going to learn new things from the teachers that we are given. For example if I was going to art class I would learn how to make art and the history of art. If your in band like me well your going to learn how to read the notes on the music sheets. In other words, everything in the extracurricular activities are educational and very helpful to you in the future. Like how you can get a full scholarship for playing sports or band.\n\nIn conclusion I agree with the principle in making every student in campus participate an extracurricular activity. These activities are fun, friend ship and team work builders, and educational for all students. In my opinion I think these activities will make students have something to look forward to after school.",

Students should not have to do an extracurricular activity because it could stress them out, not all kids have a ride back home, and kids need to relax and be kids.\n\nAfter school activities can stress students out. On top of everything they have homework, chores, and other family events to do. Kids shouldn't have to worry about something if doesn't benefit them in the future. The have lives to live and can't stress over something that might not be that important.\n\nParents and relatives shouldn't have to worry either.\n\nNot all kids have a ride back home.

Everyone can't fix their lives around the school system. That is not how life works and not how it should go.\n\nStudents and kids need to relax and enjoy being young. They can't be up and going all day long, its just to much. This is a regular students daily routine, go to school for seven hours, then go home and do at least two hours worth of homework. Then get to relax, if you were to add an extracurricular activity in the mix of all that no one would ever get a break. They can't handle all of what they have to do all ready, and adding on something else would be to much.\n\nI have learned a lot from this and students have way to much on their plate. If kids don't need to do an extracurricular activity then they shouldn't have to. We as a community, state, and country need to make sure that school systems don't make kids do something that they don't want to do.

    Essay: "Imagine, going to a school where everyone was sad, and there were not any activities to do. It doesn't sound very nice. Well, this is what is going to happen if students do not participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, you could join a sport, work on the yearbook, serve on the student council, and many more. There is something for everyone, so don't be afraid to try new things. Students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved in their school, and is a chance to make new friends.\n\nStudies show that 95% of people that join an after school activity are happier and healthier than those that don't. My brother, Generic_Name, became happier and healthier after joining a sport. Not only did he stay in shape, but his mental health improved tremendously. This all happened because he decided to try out for football. Most people are too afraid to try something new, so they won't. That is why if they are required to join something or try out they might find something that they are really good at. So, next time you are too scared to do something just remember that you won't know until you try.\n\nNext, participating in an extracurricular activity makes for a more involved student body. When, you play a sport or join a club you are showing some school spirit. School spirit makes school fun and enjoyable for both staff and students. When, school is fun you are more likely to join another club or sport, which improves your school spirit more. It is just a big chain reaction and the result is an involved student body. To start the chain reaction you have to make it a requirement to join an extracurricular activity. Yes, the students might be hesitant at first, but they'll love coming to school and participating in things in the end. These things will also improve grades, so the students will be involved and they will improve academically. All of these things make for a more involved student body.\n\nFinally, nine times out of ten people meet their lifelong friends through after school activities. Generic_Name, my sister, participated in several things; including, cheer leading, tennis, FCCLA, production, and track. She met all of her friends through extracurricular activities. Even though, she is almost out of college now, she is still friends with all of them. By putting herself out there she has made friends that she'll keep forever. This also goes back to before, Participating in a sport makes you healthy and happy. Generic_Name became happier, healthier, and involved. Now it is your turn, so will you?\n\nI believe that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved, and is a chance to make new friends. Students may want to play a sport, but they can't because they are not enough people. Or, a classmate wants to try out but they feel as though they aren't good enough. We need to encourage students to participate in something greater than themselves. By making it a requirement to participate in something, they will not be as scared to do it.

    Essay: "As a student, I think it is a great idea for kids to participate in an extracurricular activity. The reason I say this is because children need to be more active, social with people and peers, and also should take pride in their school and community. An extracurricular can help students become more interactive and confident when encountering with the society.\n\nOne extracurricular activity you can participate in would be a sport. Over the course of years students have became more obsessed, which also can mean less active. Being obsessed can affect a persons health. In the last five years children ranging of ages 10-17 have became more and more less active. So by playing a sport you can become more active and healthier. However sports can help with more than activity. When playing a sport, you will want to get better at a objective in the game. When you are wanting to get better that is known as a goal. When having goals you are having to work harder to reach for that specific accomplishment. Setting goals while not only help you in sports but also in the future.\n\nHelping with school yearbooks is another extracurricular activity. Doing yearbooks can mean a lot to your school because your are taking pride in your school. Taking pride in your school can mean a lot because it not only makes the school look good it makes you look good as a person. If you are doing yearbooks that means you are creative and have good unique ways of doing things. Being creative and able to think of new ideas can mean a lot in your future also because many businesses are looking for people who can bring big and better ideas to the table.\n\nLastly, being a student council takes a lot of responsibility and respect. Having this extracurricular activity you never know who you will or may encounter on a daily. When being a student council you should always try your best to be professional. Being social is another main concept because you are talking to people all the time. So being a student council takes a lot of effort and respect.\n\nAs a result, I think it is a good idea to let kids have extracurricular activities. These activities will help children be more interactive and prepared for the future. Helping students be more successful and active will help are society. Therefore, kids need to get good grades in order to take part in these activities. If you play a sport and your grades aren't good then your chances are lower to go to college for that specific sport. You could be the best leader, player, artist, or even have the best ideas but if you don't have good grades a college most likely won't except you. However, I think having extracurricular activities would really make students more confident and prepared for the society.",

    Essay: "Once school is over, some students stay after school for different clubs or sports teams, but a lot of students don't and go home to do homework or hangout with friends. But other students go home and start using their electronics and don't get enough exercise or socialize with any of their class mates. So I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity so that students have more time to socialize, be active, and so students can be more safe.\n\nMaking students participate in at least one extracurricular activity would give students more opportunities to socialize. Most students don't have enough time or are too busy to socialize, but when students are forced to stay after school for different clubs or sports teams they are more likely to socialized and make friends. students that become part of a club or sports team have more of a opportunity to socialize and make friends with the people around them.\n\nMaking students participate in at least one extracurricular activity would give students more opportunities to be active. Most students don't get enough exercise after school because of not having enough time, not having anybody to exercise with, or wanting to do other things more like playing video game. But if students were forced it do a extracurricular activity then they would have more of a reason to join one of the schools sports teams. Which would help them stay more active and healthy.\n\nMaking students participate in at least one extracurricular activity could keep students more safe. Because some students don't have a good home environment or live in homeless shelters. Students that don't have good home lives can sometimes get mixed up with bad people or gangs. But if they participate in after school activities they are less likely to get mixed up in bad things because they spend more time at school.\n\nI think students need to be pushed by schools to stay more active, socialize more, and to stay off the streets. Because without that students can end up in bad situations. Which can impact the rest of their lives.",

    Essay: "Have you ever wanted to do an extracurricular activity? If your awnser is a yes then i suppose the principal making everyone do a sport or club isnt so bad. How bad could extracurricular activities be anyways? I think people having to do extracurricular activities is a good idea because you could play football, you could run track or you could tutor other students.\n\nOne example of an extracurricular activity that you could do is football. Football is fun because it's the only time that you can legally hit someone as hard as you want. For example if you had a bad day once practice starts you can let out all of your energy into hitting someone as hard as you can. Another perk of playing football is that you get to become stronger, personally I don't see a downside to that. Lastly a reason that football is good is that if your one of those kids who thinks practice is the best time of the day then this is a good escape from whatever may be going on at your house or at school.\n\nAnother example of a extracurricular activity that you could do is track. One reason that track is a good extracurricular activity is that you stay in shape. Once again I see no downside to that, staying in shape is a good thing. Another reason to run track is because you can make friends during practice. because if you have nobody to talk to during practice it could get awkward or boring real quick. Lastly, an example of a good reason to run track is that you become faster. It makes sense that you would become faster considering that most of the point of running track is to be faster than your adversary.\n\nFinally, a good extracurricular activity that you could do is tutoring. Tutoring is a good thing because you are being kind. personally i think that it is kind to help a person get their grade up or help them on a upcoming test. Another reason that tutoring is good is because you get to make a friend while helping them with their work. Once again i don't see any cons to having a lot of friends. Lastly, being a tutor forces you to study as well. For example if you are tutoring someone in your math class then yall would have the same work meaning that you get to jog your memory as well.\n\nThese were some examples of fun extracurricular activities that a student could do at their school. So in conclusion, I believe that making students do at least one extracurricular activity is a good idea because you can make new friends, you could also stay in shape depending if you do a sport or not. Lastly, if you do tutoring you could keep your grades up witch is always a good thing. Finally, would you ever consider doing any of these extracurricular activites yourself?",

    Essay: "I agree with this decision. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe this because, students can have more fun, students can help the school, and students can have a better idea about what job they might want in the future.\n\nStudents are always in their classrooms learning and working. With an extracurricular activity apart of their schedule, students can have more fun at school! Students can enjoy themselves by participating in an extracurricular activity. It would be like having a break from their usual schedule.\n\nDepending on what kind of extracurricular activity the student is involved in, students can help out with school fundraisers, donations, or the weekly school news. They can start fundraisers for the school by setting up advertisements. Students can do this by making posters or setting up fund raising websites. Students can also create short videos or newspapers to inform other students about certain events that will take place during the school weeks. Students can join school clubs to help with donations as well.\n\nBy participating in an extracurricular activity, a student can really start thinking about what kind of career they might want in the future. For example, if a student decides to play for the Prince George baseball team as an extracurricular activity, then he or she may want to become a professional baseball player. Students may also enjoy working on the school yearbook. By working on the school yearbook, they may consider becoming a photographer for their career. Therefore, having an extracurricular activity can make it easier for students to decide on a job they might want for their future.\n\nIn conclusion, students can have lots of fun when having an extracurricular activity to participate in.

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities are fun. We can play sports after school, join different clubs, or play some games with other students. But we always get to choose what we want to do, right?\n\nMandatory participation in extracurricular activities is not good for students because they may not have time to stay after (jobs, other classes, homework, sports) , they might not be interested in any of the activities offered at school, and they lose the freedom to choose for themselves.\n\nStudents are quite busy people. They get homework from multiple classes, participate in sports or music classes, and they hangout with their friends and have fun being a teenager. Making students be forced to stay after school would not work for students who play sports and have practice, or students who have to help support their families with a job. Having them be forced to do an activity would take away time from other things that they need to do, or things that they want to do.\n\nEveryone has different taste. Some people like to play basketball, some like to play hockey, some like to play football. Likewise, students all have different sets of skills and things that they enjoy. Some students may want to do something that is not offered at that school, yet they wouldn't be able to. It doesn't make sense that they should participate in something that they don't enjoy. If a person who does not like to play sports is forced to play an after school sport, that would unfair towards them. Or, if a person who only likes to draw has to take an extracurricular activity, what would they do if there isn't an art club? Making the students do something they would not like or they're not interested in is not very fair.\n\nPeople are free to choose to do what they want, and everyone has that freedom. Making participation mandatory for extracurricular activities is impeding on the students right to choose for themselves. They learn in their classes that everyone has their rights, and taking them away is very unconstitutional, so it's ironic that their ability to have a choice is taken away from them. They don't have the freedom to choose if they want to participate anymore, which is unfair.\n\nIf we look on the other side of this argument, the point is that students should take extracurricular activities to better themselves. This actually makes sense, except that they should be required to do it. Mandatory participation in extracurricular activities is bad for students because the students may not have time, they might not be interested and they lose the ability to choose for themselves. It is important students that students have the right to choose so they know that there are always options. If students are forced to take extracurricular activites, they will become more disheartened, more weary and tired from balancing their social and academic lives along with sports and other classes, and wake up with less promise that they would have a good day. After all, we do need to nurture our students, as they are the future of the world, as the next generation.",

Extra activities with new people will help improve the social skills of students. Activities such as sports will keep them healthy and active. Do you not want students to be better people for others, and themselves?\n\nFirst, Students that have an extracurricular activity will stay out of trouble. When a student is doing something good for them self, and they enjoy it, they will not be getting into much trouble. If students are playing a sport they will be motivated to stay healthy and stay away from drugs. Most extra curricular activities require good behavior. Therefore, if a student gets attached to an activity they will do their best to stay out of trouble.\n\nSecondly, Students that less social skills can meet new people. Those students can create strong, long lasting bonds. Extra curricular activities can give students the friends they need that make them happy. Some friendships are even like family, and those types of bonds are important. We need students to have strong bonds and stronger social skills.\n\nFinally, These activities can keep the students healthy, and active.

    Essay: "Do you think all kids should have to do an extracurricular activity for school? I think having extracurricular activities is good to have in schools because it gives kids the chance to do different things they want to do. I also think schools should encourage students to do extracurricular activities. However, I do not think students should be forced to do an extracurricular activity at school because they might be too busy with there school work, they might have an after school job, and they could already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school.\n\nMy first reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is because they might be to busy with school work at home. Teachers give out a lot of homework in each class and some students need a lot of time to do it. Making them do an activity after school, that they probably don't even want to do, might give them a hard time because then they might not get there homework done. If they manage to do do the activity and get there homework done then they might get to bed later than usually then they will not be able to do there best the next day and all the days after.\n\nMy second reason why students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because they might have a job after school. Even if the activity that student joined only meets once a week they still might need to work that day and can't request off. They also might have the job because they need to help provide for there families. You never know what a student goes through outside of school.\n\nMy last and finally reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because what if they are already doing one outside of school. A lot of students are already doing something they want to do outside of school and if they get forced to do an extracurricular activity in school they wouldn't have enough time for the one there doing outside of school. They shouldn't have to quit one they might have been doing there whole life with friends they love to start a whole new one. It wouldn't be fair to the student.\n\nIn conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they might not have time to do one because of personal reasons. They might have to help provide for there family because there parents can't, they might need extra help with school and have a tutor help them everyday, or they might already be doing an extracurricular activity outside of school. You do not know what they do when they aren't at school. Therefore, you can't make them do things that the might not be able/want to do.",

    Essay: "I agree with doing at least one extracurricular activity. Do you like to have fun with others? If so, you should think about doing an extracurricular activity because you will have fun, it can teach you new things, and you can make new friends.\n\nThe first reason for doing an extracurricular activity is because you can have so much fun. For example, if you decide to do yearbook then you can go around your school to take pictures. You can also do volunteer work for your school games. Whenever you are out most of the time you are having fun. If you are with your friends then that's even more fun.\n\nThe second reason is that these activities can teach you new things. Say if you never played a sport before and you decide to join a team then this can teach you how to play. Learning new things can help you improve your curricular for school. You're also opening up a window that never been open before. Learning new things can also be fun, just give it a try.\n\nThe final reason is because you can make new friends. In my opinion, everybody needs friends or at least somebody to talk too. For example, say you chose to join a boy/girl scouts and nobody there knows each other that is a good opportunity to make new friends.

    Essay: "My principal has given me the opportunity to chose an extra activity that I would like to do, and that activity is basketball because I get to meet new people, stay on my daily exercise, and have fun\n\nI was claimed to be the best at basketball player at my old school from all of my friends, teachers, and coaches at my school. But now that I'm at a new school I have to prove to my new friends, teachers, and coaches that I can strive to be the best at basketball.\n\nBasketball tends helps you meet new people because you play with a team. When you play with a team you normally meet new people that are good at the game, but they could be better then you, stronger than you, faster than than you, or it could be the opposite. For example, I met one of my best friends Generic_Name playing basketball at my old school and we still are friends till this day. Now I figured you will tend to find friends while playing basketball when you ask to join a pick up game. When you join a pick up game there are normally people with the same skill if not better than you. Another example would be,one time I joined this pick up game and met this kid named Generic_Name. He was really good at the game and showed me a few pointer like keep your foot lined up to the rim and when you dribble get down low so you have more control of the ball, stuff like that.\n\nBasketball is a good way to keep your daily exercise going because when you run it gets your heart rate up, you burn fat, and you add to your endurance. Now when your running down the floor, 40% of your energy being used and 60% of heat is being added to you. When your using your arms to dribble the ball, you are using your main muscles in your arms to go back and forth between both sides, we call them repetitions. For example when your working out at the gym you do bicep curls, Its just like that just with a basketball. But just remember the more your work on keeping your exercise up for basketball the better you will get. You will start running faster witch helps you get back on defense and fast breaks on offense. The reason why people still use basketball to exercise is because its something they love to.\n\nThe real reason why basketball is fun is because you get to hang out with your friends. Basketball wouldnt be nearly as fun if it werent for your friends. You get to play pick up games, horse, and challenge other friend groups to test your skill. There are different types of fun for different players, like shooting hoops by your self, shooting around with your friends and playing pick up games, they are all examples of what fun could be like for basketball players. You could play a ton defense and working on blocking and stealing, or you could be a point guard or someone on the wing that likes shooting mid range shots that could be your fun. There are many different types of fun in the game of basketball you just have to find your type of fun.\n\nBasketball isnt just a sport, its a lifestyle. You work out, have fun, and meet new people, you just have to be willing to take the risk to make it your hobby. If your cant be willing to put your everything in to this then there in not point in even. Its just going to always be in the back of your mind saying, \"why didnt I stick to what I love.\" Luckily I am one of the lucky people that will never stop trying for what I love.",

I personally disagree, even though it is a good idea, some students don't have the time to participate in these activities. Many students already participate in activities outside of school and are usually busy enough with school work and studying. Im sure some students would enjoy this but it is not meant for all students.\n\nWhen kids come home from school they want to have a break, they dont want to go straight back to work, they want to sit down and maybe have a snack. School is already hard enough and they would get overwhelmed with more activities to do. Some kids don't have the time to participate in extracurricular activities because they might already have something planned or they might be trying to do different activities that they actually want to do. If they were forced to participate in these activities it would put on a lot of stress and take away time for them to do something else. Many kids have to go somewhere after school and they might not have any free time to do these activities.\n\nA lot of students already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school and it takes up a lot of their time so if they had to take part in the activities again, it would not only take up a lot of time, but the students would have to cope with more things on their to do list, which leads to stress, and less free time to do things with their friends or by them selves. Also if kids had to do these extracurricular activities they would miss out on other things such as homework, or events. They would also miss out on things they have already signed up for and if they don't participate in these activities I'm sure they would get in trouble.\n\nSome kids take a break when they get home and some kids go straight to homework. School work and homework take up many hours of your day, and if we participated in these activities it would add to our to do list. Many kids like to study for hours and put all their effort into school, so I imagine they would be exhausted at the end of the day. If we were forced to participate in the extracurricular activities it could take away time from our sleep, when someone doesn't get as much sleep as they usually do they don't work as hard the next day and they would not be in a good mood the next day.\n\nThese extracurricular activities could be fun and they would be good on a resume, but they aren't meant for everyone. They would take up to much time with all the school work and activities everyone already has, and some kids don't want to do them because they would feel overwhelmed with everything they already have to do.

I don't think students should have to participate in any extracurricular activities because students would want to relax and get more sleep, students could finish projects and homework, and students might be afraid to do extracurricular activities because they think that they could get hurt. There are a lot of reasons why I don't think students should have to participate in any extracurricular activities so I will explain all of them.\n\nStudents might want to catch up on sleep that they missed the night before or relax after a long day of school. This is because it would help students brains refresh or reboot by giving them a longer break. Some students also stay up too late working on long/short projects and homework that their teacher assigned so they don't get enough sleep that day. Because they don't get enough sleep, they become tired, which affects their moods during the school day and causes them to not only feel tired, but depressed and angry. Sleep really affects students ability to focus and finish their work on time but if they have to do an extracurricular activity after school, then that will make them more tired and will take away the extra time they get to catch up on sleep and relax.\n\nStudents could finish up unfinished classwork or work on extra homework and big/small projects. I get a lot of class work in each of my classes during the school day and I end up having an extra page of unfinished classwork to work on and when that all adds up from each of my classes it turns into homework. I can't imagine if I didn't have time after school to work on this but some students don't have time after school and all that homework adds onto projects that teachers hand out. If students have to do an extracurricular activity after school, then they won't have any time to hangout or spend time with friends.\n\nStudents could get hurt mentally or physically from extracurricular activities. If students wanted to be part of making the yearbook and they messed up on drawing a picture in it, they would be picked on or made fun of for their bad drawing. School bullies might even start to pick on you or physically hurt you. If you decided to do sports you could be made fun of for your size, if you're good or bad at that sport, or if you're weak. If you decided to do sports you could also physically hurt yourself like your leg, arm, hand, finger, ankle, etc.\n\nI think overall students shouldn't have to do any type of extracurricular activity. It will take away the extra time they need to relax and catch up on sleep, the extra time they could use to finish unfinished classwork and homework, and limit the safety of their body and thoughts so they don't get any injuries or negative thoughts. I hope you agree with my decision about why we don't need extracurricular activities and the negative impacts they could have on us.",

I believe that students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities. Doing so can cause stress for students who are already taking challenging courses, and it can also disrupt the students' parents and the town in order to accommodate for transportation. Additionally, some students may be unable to afford taking part in extracurricular activities. Requiring that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity is unwise, hindering, and futile.\n\nFor example, many students are enrolled in challenging courses. These classes are challenging because of their workload and computational difficulty. Consequently, the students will only be more stressed with the addition of an extracurricular activity on top of their schoolwork. This extra layer of stress may cause a decline in the overall academic performance of the students, which in turn will hurt the overall academic performance of the school. The stress may also harm the students' health by causing a lack of sleep. Thus, requiring the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is unwise.\n\nThe students are not the only ones to suffer from your decision. Their parents, too, must disrupt their schedules in order to accommodate for the students' transportation. The extra amount of traffic is undesirable for the parents and the town. Additionally, the fuel that is spent on transportation is both costly and harmful to the environment. Essentially, requiring participation in extracurricular activities only hinders the parents, town, and economy.\n\nLastly, some students may be unable to afford participating in extracurricular activities. Sports equipment, costumes, and paper are all examples of costly items that many extracurricular activities require funding for, often from the participants. Some students cannot even afford their own lunch, so it is physically impossible for them to take part in an even more costly activity. It is futile to require the students to participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nSome may argue that extracurricular activities are worth the time and effort because they allow the students to experience real-life scenarios and develop teamwork and sportsmanship skills. These are valuable and necessary skills and experiences, but not at the cost of the students' health and stable mental state. If the students wish to participate in the activities, then they should, but students with too much work should not be forced to add another activity to their plate.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with your decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This requirement can cause the students to stress, and it also hinders their parents' work and the town traffic. Some students may not even be able to afford participation in extracurricular activities. Thus, I ask that you reconsider your decision because it is a hindrance to many, unwise, and ultimately futile.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name",

All students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nObviously, students would develop and strengthen their skills/knowledge of their chosen activity. The Generic_School board proves that students are much more likely to succeed when they have a strong understanding of a subject they enjoy. By engaging in at least one extracurricular activity, students would be able to improve the knowledge they have of that particular activity. This idea not only brings education outside the classroom, but engages students in something they are truly passionate about. Extracirricular activities offer education without the hassle and means of being at school, which can be very draining for many students.\n\nIn addition, there is a perfect extracurricular activity for everyone. The principal of Generic_School (Generic_School) has promised 15 new extracurricular activities that will include transportation from the school. There is no need to be concerned about finding the perfect activity, the school has go you covered. The possibilities of activities are endless. They include anything from athletics to academics, or just plain fun!\n\nEven more so, students will have the chance to improve their bonds and friendships through the time dedicated to these activities. Harvard University conducted a study stating, \"students become more social when in an environment that requires it\". With these activities, the isolation many students feel could disappear as students would have the chance to meet people who share common interests. This opportunity is unavailable at school since students are grouped together based on classes not their personal interests.\n\nUnfortunately, many people still believe extracurricular activities are expensive and a waste of time. According to Instagram. com, user @TimmyTurner claimed he had a terrible experience with his extracurricular activity. He claimed it was extremely expensive and hard to keep up with due to unreasonable \"issues\". This however is not true for Generic_School students. They will have the opportunity to change their activity once if they dislike it. In addition, the school worked with each actiivity specialist and tried to keep the prices very low. Generic_School understands that not everyone will be able to afford their activities. For this reason, the school will sponsor 100 children from families in need of financial help.\n\nBy participating in at least one extracurricular activity, student will develop and strengthen skills towards that activity, have the chance to find the perfect activity, build bonds with others, and get financial help. All students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Believe me, it is much easier to sit at home and watch Netflix all afternoon. However, nothing can compare to doing something you love with the people you care about. Every child should have the opportunity to have that much fun... right?",

    Essay: "I think that giving kids an after school activity is great because they could have more social time. Meaning as in they could see their friends more often and talk to them more. They could have more exercise physicaly and mentally based on their activity. And they could also make new friends to talk to and then they could have a better realtionship. But the only problem with this is that some students might not like staying after school and just want to go home early. So if the principal does this students could start acting up like they always do. And also another problem could also be that students might have somewhere to be or they already have a after school program that they go to. But another reason why this is good and also important is because students can find a new skill or talent that they never knew they had. And they could start improving on that and use that new skill or talent in the future. Students will also be trying out new things and this could possibly help them out with classes in their regular schedule.\n\nAnd here are some activitys that students could particapte in. Sports, they could particapte in any sport and that could help them physicaly. Like football because most athletic students join football because of the many postions there are in the sport. In football students don't have to be in any type of physical form like it does not matter if you are skinney or fat. This is because football has many postions that will need bigger people so students who think that they are over weight and can't do any sports should try doing football. And if you are not really the physical type of person then schools also have other programs as well. Like if you are a more smart type of person or you are a person who likes calmer activitys and likes to exercise their brain out then you could go to the game club and their could be some board games their that require lots of smart thinking and stragety. This game could be like chess a lot of people like chess and I think that chess is a good game to learn and play because how it exercises the brain. So if a student wants find a game that is fun,easy and stragetic to learn and play I think that chess is the perfect game.\n\nAnd if there are students who don't like physical or stragetic activitys then there are still dancing and chorus activitys. If students think that they can be good with instruments they could go in to band and do some practicing there and even though it is not an after school activity it is still a skill that students can learn and develop and could possibily be good at it. Band is pretty easy though because anyone can learn no matter how smart you are if you just put in the right amount of effort and practice and if you also pay attention during the class you will understand it easily. So that is what I feel about the extracurricular activitys I personally think that it is a great idea and it should totaly be a thing in school today and all students should try something new out.",

    Essay: "Yes I do feel that kids should do sports but this isnt my choice to make. The principle should not be able to ethier it is against are laws. In this cuntrey we have the right to have a choice and vote, and that cant be taken away.\n\nNow I do feel that kids are not getting out into the world enough. This is because of technolgy, kids dont want to go outside with there friends. kids are staying inside playing video games, and that is a fact. Now a mix of both is great and brings the best of both worlds to are comunity.\n\nPeople have the right to chose, and if you are taking away this then you are taking away from rights. It is a great idea, but it won't work all of the time, because kids have things to do when they get home. And if they are already playing sports outside of school, how are they going to fit this into there schedule. The school does not know what they do at home so how can they expect them to do homework and everthing else in just one week.\n\nThis issue can be fixed, by sending home a letter. This letter will ask the parents if they can make the kids play sports. This will eliminate the issue because parents can say if they play a sport already. And if they already are busy, and cant, then they dont have to do a sport or an activity after school.\n\nAll in all this is a great thing and a horrible thing because it does not always work. Kids need the right of choice, it is an essintial right, that we even as adults need. But kids also need to get outside into the world and ,sweat, workout, and play. with this comprimise I have shown teachers, and parents can figure this out. With my take on this issue I feel I have coverd all ground, and have shown what needs to be done to make the parents and the principle comprimise.",

    Essay: "I think that if a child don't wanna do at least one extracurricular activity the child don't have to because of work,family,money, and maybe the child is just tried and wanna chill after school.\n\nFamily can take up a lot of time. If you have a brother's or sister's maybe even someone in your family is sick and you have to take care of them. Sometimes your mom and dad have to work. On top of going to school and making sure your grades are good so you'll be able to stay in your extracurricular activity. That takes a lot of time and after a while you'll get tried and that's not healthy.\n\nMoney can be a big reason why you can't do one. Most extracurricular activity cost a lot of money mostly sports. It can even be getting to where your suppose to go because some people don't have cars. Some people have to go to work depending on if what grade there in and there mom or dad have the money or not. extracurricular cost a lot of money that people don't have.\n\nSometimes work can get in the way of extracurricular activity. If your in high school depending or your age you might have a job. Taking time or showing up late to your job will hurt your pay check might even get fried. High school is not the only one that goes threw this all grades do most of the time people moms and dads have to work. That happened's to a lot of kids and Teens.\n\nLastly sometimes after a long day if school you might wanna go home and chill. School is a lot to handle on the mind. To class work, grades, and people sometimes a child don't even like to talk to people but there family. After doing studying,doing homework and taking test you'll get tried and dont wanna do anything else. That's a lot of work on the mind.\n\nFinally people have others things to do or can't do it at all because of work, money family, and just dont wanna do anything.

    Essay: "Students should not be forced to do any extracurricular activities against their will. Making the decision of forcing students to do extracurricular activities will decrease their will to work, increase cost for schools, and need time to breathe. Here is why forcing students to do extracurricular activites is so bad.\n\nOne of the reasons why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is that they will not want to do anything and will not do anything. If students were forced to work on the yearbook, the students working on it will not do anything and not try their best. Then the yearbook would be done poorly or not even done at all. If the students were forced to be on the student council then they would not do anything at all and the council would be just for show. Whatever extracurricular activities they will be forced to do, they will not try hard at all and nothing will be done at all.\n\nAnother reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is that it will increase costs for the school. The school would have to pay for any supplies and teacher that stays after. If the school were to have a basketball team, the school will have to pay the teacher for staying after and the basketballs in case they don't have them or need more. If there was a board game club, the school will have to pay for the board games and the teacher staying after. Each activity needs supplies and a teacher to supervise or help the students so the overall costs will go up if the amount of students that stay after go up.\n\nThe last reason why students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities is that some people need time to breathe after school. They cannot go to school and then right after school do even more work they may not even like. They would rather indulge in their hobbies and have fun playing games or outside with friends and have fun doing the things they love. They students may even crash from all the work given to them without a break.\n\nMaking the decision of forcing students to do extracurricular activities will decrease their will to work, increase cost for schools, and need time to breathe. Why should students be forced to do something they don't want to and will harm the school's budget? Students need choice and need to enjoy life without someone forcng them to do something they don't like. Thats why overall, students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "There should not be a rule that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. It just dosen't make sense no one should have to do anything especially an extracurricular activity. This is a bad thing for the school because, parents might be on a tight schedule so their students wouldn't be able to go to an extracurricular activity. Which means that the rule wouldn't effect most students at all.\n\nA lot of people have a tight schedule and wouldn't be able to go because there parents have to work. Some kids live to far to walk home from the school so they would have get there parents to drive them home, but there parents can't drive them because they are at work. For example, some parents have to work double shifts or two jobs to make ends meet or the single moms or dads have to be at work so then they can't pick up their students from school.\n\nMost students have other things that they have to go to. Whether it be sports, tutoring or having to go to their jobs (for high school kids) or they could even just be going home because their parents have to take them some where before the extracurricular activities end. They could have to go to all sorts of places after school. Yes, you could just go to the teacher you have that class with for tutoring but, what if you don't like that teacher and want a different way of teaching or you have gone to a specific tutoring place for a long time that you enjoy.\n\nSome Teachers aren't always going to be able to stay after. They could have to go somewhere or they could have a meeting or another thing that would hold them up from being able to stay after for extracurricular activities. This would make it so some students wouldn't have a teacher to stay after with or an activity to do after school. Then the students would think that the teacher that they stay after with won't be there next week or for the rest of the year, and this would create some confusion because then the teachers would be confused on why none of the students are to them for extracurricular activities.\n\nThis would not be a succes for the school. This wouldn't work with parents having to pick up their students or their schedule is to tight. It dosen't make sense for the school to make this rule. It can effect the way that kids see after school activities.

    Essay: "Have you ever wanted to try something new while still having fun and making friends? Extracurricular activities are a great way to go! Extracurricular activities help you make friends, learn helpful skills in life, discover your passion, and make the school community better. I agree with the principals decision, every student should participate in extracurricular activities. I believe once given a chance, every student will find and love a certain extracurricular activity that speaks to them.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people, and make friends. When you join an extracurricular activity you meet new people who share the same interest as you. If you're socially awkward or shy extracurricular activities may seem like your worst nightmare. Fortunately, your shared interest will give you something to talk about with your peers that are there, and chances are, you're not the only new person participating. Making new friends can give you someone to talk to, they can make you smile more, and make your day better. Maybe you meet your friends that stay with you for the rest of your life during that activity, if you never try it, you'll never know.\n\nGoing to extracurricular activities can also teach you helpful skills in life. There are many different types of extracurricular activities, some you do only for fun, some you do to help your community, and some you do to learn new skills. If you've always thought about trying a certain activity, but you're not sure if you'll like it, extracurricular activities are a great way to go! There are so many different activities that you could try, many of them help you gain skills you'll use later in life. As an example I took Tech Ed, I was wary about it at first, but I had so much fun, and I learned many useful tools in life. I also took Home EC. which taught me how to cook and sew. I learned so much from both classes, and learned many skills from both of them that I will use later in life.\n\nParticipating in extracurricular activities can also help you discover your passion. Trying something new can be scary at first, but chances are, you'll find something you like. People discover their passion by trying new things. As your extracurricular activity you may choose to take Tech Ed. You find out that you really like seeing how things are put together, and building things, so you decide to become an engineer or architect when your older. If you never tried Tech Ed you never would have known that you want to become an engineer, and you would have never discovered your love for building things. By participating in new things you have the chance to discover your passion, what you want to do for the rest of your life.\n\nParticipating in extracurricular activities not only helps you, but also the school you go to, and your community. Every activity you do helps the school community in someway, so you're not only helping yourself, you're also helping the school community become better. Whether you're picking up trash, tutoring younger students, or you're part of the school basketball team, they all help the school become better. By helping the school, you are ensuring that your legacy lives on, you are ensuring that your school community is the best it can be, for you, for your friends, and for those that come after you.\n\nI agree with the principals decision that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students gain so much from participating in extracurricular activities. They make new friends, learn skills that they will use later in life, discover their passion, and make their community a better place. I want to make every students middle and high school years the best that they can be. By participating in extracurricular activities, I believe they will be one step closer to achieving that.",

    Essay: "I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Participating in an extracurricular activity could help students build their teamwork skills. Depending on which extracurricular activity students participate in, it could help strengthen some of their teamwork skills and their ability to work with others. It could also help some shy students become more social and help them want to work with others and participate in different activities. Say someone who really didn't like working with other people, and only liked to do things by himself, joined the soccer team. When they would play practice games he would never pass to anyone, he kept the ball to himself, even when a few of his teammates were wide open, he never passed to them because he wanted to make the goal himself. However, every time he tried to make a goal alone, he always failed, and soon he learned that he would never make a goal by keeping the ball all to himself. He learned that in order to win, he must pass the ball and work with his teammates, passing the ball back and forth. He learned that the only way to win was through teamwork, had he not joined the soccer team, it would have taken him a while to learn that sometimes it's best to work with people, and joining that soccer team helped him build up his teamwork skills. Having students participate in an extracurricular activity will help strengthen their teamwork skill and help some people figure out what they like, what they don't like, and lean how to be more comfortable around people.\n\nStudents can figure out what they're into, what they like to do and what they don't like to do. When students participate in different activities they figure out that they might like soccer and pottery, but hate drawing and writing. They get to figure out what they enjoy and what they don't enjoy, and some may like doing something so much that they might what to do it as a job later in life when they're older. In 5th grade I joined orchestra because I wanted to try something new. I chose to play the cello because I had heard people playing their cello's a while ago, but I remembered how beautiful it sounded. Also because I had seen a movie then about this girl who played the cello and she played beautiful pieces and wanted to play the cello as her career. It was an amazing movie and after watching it I could not get it out of my head. So that's when I decided i wanted play the cello. The first year playing the cello was pretty difficult because I did not know how to read the music and my teacher at my elemetry school was not really teaching me how to read the notes, but I was not really trying to either so that made it pretty difficult. The second year was a little better but still pretty bad because I still had not learned how to properly read the music. I had the same music teacher as last year and she still did not teach me how to read the notes or what they were called, but then again, just like last year, I was not really trying either. I would recognize some of the notes but still had no idea what they were called. So in those two years i basically learned how to play the cello, but not how to read what I played. Coming into middle school, I did not think I would continue to play the cello, considering my experience from the 2 years before, but I did choose to continue playing the cello going into middle school. That's where I met my new orchestra teachers and they taught me how to read the music. It took sometime but know I can read music sheets perfectly fine and I continued to play the cello into 8th grade as well. I tried something new, and the first 2 years were not the best, but towards the end, I ended loving to play the cello, even if Im not the best at it. Growing up kids find out what they enjoy and what they dislike, and that shapes how they see things and their personality. Including figuring what they want to do in the future, by figuring out what they enjoy doing, and avoiding the things they don't enjoy doing or being apart of, while having fun.\n\nStudents can have fun while participating in extracurricular activities and enjoy themselves. Students can have fun with they're friends while participating in different activities and might get to do cool projects and experiments, depending on what activity they participate in. Whichever one students decide to participate in, they'll have fun with the people who are in that activity as well while still participating and doing what they're told by the teacher in charge of that activity. In orchestra we play a lot of different music for different concerts and also just as warm ups. Almost everyone has a stand partner, unless someone has their own stand. You might need to talk to your stand partner and sometimes you become friends with them. Though it does not seem like it, you can make a lot of friends in orchestra, even if you play a different instrument or sit across the room from each other. There are times where we have to be serious, like preparing for a concert or during a concert, but before we can talk to each other, practice together, or just talk sometimes. One time before a concert, my best friends sat next to me and we started playing pieces together, even thought we don't play the same instrument. We have fun with our friends and we enjoy playing together, even if we mess up a lot, it is still fun. Students get to enjoy themselves and have fun while still doing the work that they must do for that activity and get to figure out what they like doing and what they dislike, also while being with their friends.\n\nAll students should participate in extracurricular activities because participating them can help students in so many ways. They can teach students what they like and what they dislike and learn different things depending on which activity you're apart of. Students also get to have fun and spend time with their friends while also working and participating with the activity.",

By making students sign up for a sport would change that, not only would it make the student body healthier, but also it would bond the school. Sports could even pay off in the end for students but also schools. The way sports can change a school are endless but you can't have a sport team with out students. By making students sigh up for sports you are not only grantee a sport team but also a healthier and kinder school.\n\nSecond, Sports aren't for everyone maybe students want to become smarter or kinder in their school and community. Students could do that by joining a club like the F.O.R club. Students could also help their school by joining S.C.A\n\nboth of these clubs are very active. They are active in both their community and their school. Having students join clubs would benefit the school in health but it would benefit the schools community. If students were to join clubs the schools would be a safer and better place for both students and staff.\n\nThird, some are students that aren't very active in both sports and the community. Those students could join teaching program to help benefit students. Those students would also be benefiting the school too. These student would most likely want to be come teachers.

All around this program would make the school a smarter place.\n\nIs making students join one extracurricular active a good idea? Yes it is both students and the school would benefit from this rule change. The schools sports teams, clubs, and teaching program would be booming.

    Essay: "Do you think that we should have school activites? I think we should because it could possible benefit kid in learning. Which means helping kids with better learning that is gong to benefit them by getting up and doing an activity that might help refresh their minds instead of the kid siting in class all day learning about something that might not be instresting to them and they might start to day dream and them not learning anything. I think the school should have activities for students.\n\nfirstly, It would benefit a childs learning by refreshing their minds. According to a studies done by Virginia Techs mental studies, states that 74% of students fall asleep or day dream and stop listening and the other 26% of students listen and learn because they are involed in activities that help refresh there minds and givings them time to thing. What this means is that 74% of student stop listening do to being board or just no intrested but the other 26% is in a club or sport that helps that student refresh their mind and helps them think so they are ready for classes and other work that is needed to be done.\n\nsecondly, depeneding on the activity it could help build a skill in a student. according to sports news website on collage sports, suggests that 25% of sports players in collage sports that train hard and keep lead to building skills that could help down the road and the other 75% of collage players that dont train hard and just sit around learn how to succed through failer. This means that the collage students that try their best are the one mostly building skills that will help them succed and the other 75% who dont try learn skills through not putting more work into it knowing what they need to try to improve on to become better.\n\nthirdly, trying something new could help find things you might like. according to a studies done at a Virgina univitsy, suggest that 83% of the kid in school that had join club or sports had found a hobby that they enjoy doing and the other 17% of the students that took a club or a sport didn't or could find an intrest in that subject of activities. this mean that students found new hobby that enjoy to do in school when they have tine to do it and the students that didn't find a hobby that they dont enjoy probably dropped out of the club or the sport they were in.\n\nthe other point of view, It would be another thing added to a students list and another thing they would have to stress about. According Anderson shores a mental health studies doctor, states that 65% of students that have something else to add to their scedules stresses them do to having a bussy scedule already and the 35% percent of the other students do get stressed out do to not having a bussy scedule or they have good time management. This means that the students that have bussy scedules and cant add this to their scedules so they get stressed and dont know what to do, do to the fact of not being able to find time for it, and the other 35% has time for it so they can add it to their scedules. However this is true but let me tell you why this isnt the case for all students. According to a studies done on time managment, states that 80% of students could manage their time so they could do these activity and the other 20% said the reason they couldn't was do to not properly setting up a good scedule. Basically this means that 80% had the time for it and the other 20% of students couldn't because they didn't set a scedule up properly or just didnt set one up.\n\nTo sum it up, there should be activitys it help the student you the reader better learn and buil skill maybe even find a hobby that you like. I think the people that go against this shouldn't but that my opinion, and the reason I think they shouldn't is because it helps benefit learning it help the student refresh so they don't fall alsleep in class o start day dreaming because if they stop listening how are they going to learn. you the reader could do something about this you talk to other students or teachers and get their take on it.

Many people, including me, take foreign language classes after school. So, having to stay for yearbook, student council, or anything extra, would interfere with these classes. The majority of students volunteer or do charity work after school, and or on the weekends. I volunteer as a tutor every other day, but if I had to participate in extra activities, it would clash with my tutoring schedule. Participating in extracurricular activities is unnecessary because it shortens the things you can do outside of school.\n\nBeing included in extracurricular activities is mentally and physically draining for both students and teachers. All students wake up at six or earlier in the morning to go to school. Teenagers my age and older need sleep because we are in the growing process, so having to do something extra is not practical. Teachers already teach multiple classes throughout the day. Having another class to look after is not very beneficial. Students already come home from a long day at school and have to do more studying and homework. I usually dont sleep a lot, but yesterday when I came back from school I fell asleep at six in the evening! Participating in extracurricular activities has many negative effects, and one is that it causes students to be very tired.\n\nEven though participating in extra activities gives you a better chance at getting into colleges, it causes extra funding. Schools are already responsible for paying for everything a school needs,such as lunches,vending machines, teachers paychecks, and much more. In reality, schools are not very rich, so it would be an unreasonable choice to have extracurricular activities. Schools would have to pay for after school snacks, overtime pay checks for teachers, and more. Its not a very strategic move when your not financially stable. Participating in extracurricular activities is unpractical because it causes extra funding.\n\nStudents should not be forced against their will to take part in extracurricular activities. Everything you can do from participating in sports to serving on student council are tiring and should be done by choice, not by demand. There are much more negative effects than positive effects to it.",

    Essay: "Students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are helpful in many different ways. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you get time to socialize, have fun, and do something productive.\n\nOne reason you should participate in extracurricular activities is because you get the time to socialize with others. Knowing that you will be doing this activity for a while, it becomes easier to talk to other students. When I know that I am doing an activity that I will enjoy, it becomes easier for me to talk to other students and open up a bit. Socializing with people also helps you feel a bit lighter. When there is something that is annoying me I tell a friend or a teacher that I trust and who better than those friends who are doing the same extracurricular activity as you. Your friends are usually doing the same extracurricular activity as you and that helps because you can work and talk with your friends at the same time. Last year many of my friends participated in the same extracurricular activity as me and this year again many of of many friends are doing the same extracurricular activity as me. These are some of the ways that participating in a extracurricular activity can help with your socializing abilities with others.\n\nAnother reason you should participate in extracurricular activities is because extracurricular activities are really fun. Usually the extracurricular activity you take is the one that you like, so you have a lot of fun in it. The extracurricular activity I am taking is art and I love that class. Most of the time whatever extracurricular activity you are in your friends are in it to, if not then you make friends and you end up having a lot of fun in that class. In art I have many friends and I enjoy the class a lot. During extracurricular activities you can relax and fool around a bit. Extracurricular activities are my favorite because I can relax, have fun, and let out any stress from the day. These are some of the ways you can have fun in a extracurricular activity.\n\nMany people believe that students shouldn't participate in extracurricular activities. They think that extracurricular activities aren't productive, and they are a waste of time. Extracurricular activities have helped people in many different ways. People only take extracurricular activities because they think extracurricular activities are productive and they can help them out in school too. I participate in extracurricular activities because I think they are important, productive, and can help me in many different ways. Extracurricular activities help relax a students mind. Extracurricular activities have helped me relax and open my mind so that I can do good in school in every possible way.

    Essay: "I would disagree with the principals idea because some people might not have enough time and trouble the parents with their schedule . Or a person just doesn't want to do any of the activities, theres would be nothing interesting for them to do. It would be a waste of time and money for the teachers who want to teach but the kids are just not into it and the waste of money on the sports. It would be best to let them decide what activity they should do and not make it mandatory.\n\nStudents may have their own plans they planned ahead but then they get suddenly told that they must do one extracurricular activity for school and dont have time for it . It would disturb the student schedule and the parents plans for their kid! For example the parents have an appointment for a future date. Then get a email that their daughter signed up for soccer and the team meets on the same day the parents had their kids appointment for. They would have to change everything and make a new appointment and it can take a long time. Or their kid stays after but theres no late buses on that day and both parents are working and can't pick them up. What would they do then? It would be just a hassle for both the student or parents.\n\nWhats would happen if only a few students or too many join? It would cause a lot of problems for the school to deal with. Like If only two students join basketball, what would they do? They can't play with only two so they would have to disband. But then if one activity is full and a bunch of people want to only join that activity it would cause headaches for the staff and teachers. Also what would happen if a bunch of people have no interest in any of them, you cant force them so you really wouldn't have control of the situation at hand. So it wouldn't really even work if theres going to be so many problems.\n\nIt would also be a waste of time for the teachers or coaches if your going to make it official. For the students who do pick something but have no interest in it , it be a waste of time for the teachers teaching. They would just not listen or do anything. So why should the teachers have to teach them when they could teach the actual kids who might want to learn? For the kid who just signed up for the sake of it being mandatory, they could be having other plans for studying or spending time with their family. Also it would be especially bad if a student signs up for a sport and does nothing to help out. It would be bad for the actual kids who want to play and the whole team , then the money spent into the activities. It would just be a waste of time,money and effort put into the whole thing.\n\nSo I would definitely disagree with the idea of the mandatory extracurricular activities because of the hassle for the parents, the non interest and waste in time. It would just be horrible and trouble for the whole school, and we wouldn't want that. We should just stick with what the students want to do and let them pick what they want and let them have fun.",

    Essay: "School days can be a drag at times, and can cause a lack of interest and become unmotivated in school. Then at the end of every school day, most of us go home to relax from the day we went through, but sometimes going home to the same old routine can become boring. However, the principal announcing that every student should take an extracurricular activity sounds like a great solution to this, because these activities will allow students to interact with others, introduce students to be able to learn new skill sets, and give students a chance to participate in activities they love.\n\nOne reason that the principal's decision is a good idea is because this will allow students to interact with each other more often. Sure, we do that everyday during school, but if you were to join a club or group, it would be a great opportunity to make new friends. Since you would be choosing a group based on your interests instead of attending a common subject, this would mean that others in your group would share the same interests as you, which is great for connecting with others. For example, when I was in a little soccer league, I was able to talk and play with others while knowing that they liked the same things that I did, which made me feel included and a part of the team. Being able to interact with others also allow for the improvement of social and teamwork skills. Playing in a sport is a good example of this because of how teammates cooperate with each other to reach their goal and win the game. It can be fun during games when you pass the ball to each other before shooting a goal, making making the whole team know that they all made a big contribution during the game.\n\nAnother reason that having a required extracurricular is a good idea is how they can give students a chance to find new hobbies and skills. Whatever extracurricular you choose can introduce you to a skill set based off your liking. Say if someone were interested technology, computers, robots and such. They could join a coding or engineering club, which could become an new hobby for themselves. This can also apply to choosing activities out of someone's comfort zone. Students that choose to join groups out of their average liking can lead to the development of a new hobby that they never knew they had. Once when I had to stay after school to attend a concert, so I had to take an activity in the meantime. One of the only choices available was a social study group, which I needed at the time. It turned out to be a pleasant experience while working with others. Gaining new hobbies from extracurricular activities can also skills to help students find what they're going to do in the future. Like if someone were interested in wildlife or animals. That person could join a wildlife conservation group or an awareness group of some sort, so they could be involved with the thing they love and be introduced to a new skill that can also be beneficial in their community and even in their future.\n\nA third reason for why required extracurricular activities are a good idea is that they can allow students to enjoy themselves. Students know how it feels to have to lag through every school day, as well as having to worry about their grades and piling school work. Being in an extracurricular can take your mind off of school in the moments you're in that group, and let you enjoy the time you spend there instead of having to stress yourself out more than you can handle. And, as previously stated, you'll be able to spend time with other students who know what it's like to face unmotivated times in school, home, or any other place. They can all talk to each other and do what interests them while even learning about topics without having piles of work to do afterwards, like in a coding club. And you'll be able to relax more often, or at the very least do what you think is fun. Like make arts and crafts, make or play games, play a sport, help the environment. Whatever you enjoy doing, there's most likely a club just for that. Something that you and any other student can enjoy.\n\nHaving to take a required extracurricular activity doesn't seem as bad when you think about it. You're able to be with and connect with others, discover new activities that you didn't even know you would enjoy, and take your mind off of the stressful events going on and enjoy yourself. So if you like the sound of that, then having an extracurricular seems like a great idea that you can give a chance.",

    Essay: "I do not agree. I think that students shouldnt have to do any extracurricular activities if they dont want to. It should be a students/kids free choice to do what they want when it comes to extracurricular activities/hobbies. Adults shouldnt control that. These days students are very wide spanned.\n\nA lot of kids have different interests on what they like to do. A lot of interests/hobbies arent an option in school and they shouldn't have to be forced to do one. Most kids dont have much freetime and by the schools doing this it takes away that time for a student/kid to do what they like. Yes, it's different if someone likes one of the activities provided but thats usually not the case and kids these days tend to have a lot of interests.\n\nA student may not enjoy any of these extracurricular activities. They should have the choice to do what they like and not be forced by the school and/or parent to do one. A lot of the time when a kid is forced into what activities to do he/she doesn't have fun. Sometimes that can lead to that person being sad all the time and that can even lead to a depressed child/student.\n\nSome kids don't want to do any extracurricular activities at all. Some students sometimes dont have any interests and all they wanna do is sit around and eat or something like that. At a young age a lot of students haven't even found an interest or something they like to do and it can be hard for them to have fun or enjoy doing something like that. Every student is different and some are just very lazy and either don't see the need to do anything or just dont feel like it.\n\nAs you can see and probably observe in your life to is that the generation these days are very difficult. Some people even know things they like to do or know what there good at age 18 or even older. Therefore the schools shouldn't be allowed to force people to do even just 1 because it may seem like something easy or something that should be mandatory but its only fair not to. These days students are very wide spanned.",

    Essay: "Imagine yourself in your room and your mom comes in and says, \" Find an activity to do outside.\" You just moan and roll your eyes. Don't do that. Find a friend that will join you in your journey of an activity and make it fun. You can find so many activities to do. You can do a sport, an outdoor activity, anything.\n\nWhat you choose can be a helpful thing for your friend. They may enjoy the activity and want to do it more often. Including, getting stronger and faster during it. Also, they may be determined to go outside more often, instead of being stuck inside all day on technology. It can be a great exercise to do, and it may be really fun to do.\n\nAlthough your parents bug you about it, think about all the things your parents have done for you. They clean the house, do the laundry, and make you meals. So, in appreciation of your parents, go and have fun outside. Now, your parents can read their book they've been waiting to read. They can take more naps so they're not so cranky.\n\nAlso, they can have less stress and not yell as much. And also, less messes for them to clean up.\n\nAll of this can also be really helpful for you. You may work more harder than you have in the past. You may find more activities that seem fun and try them for yourself. You'll also be outside more and make your parents happy. These activities can help with your exercise. It may even be really fun, that it doesn't even feel like a workout.\n\nIn conclusion, doing something your not comfortable doing, can help everyone in some way. You may help a friend get outside more and have a great time. Your parents can have more free time to do what they want to do. Instead of having to pick up after you and your messes.\n\nYou can help yourself by being more active in activities and have fun.

    Essay: "Students should participate in extracurricular activities at school so they have a better understanding on how they can work on themselves. I think we should participate in more activities at school because it will help students practice classes they're struggling with at school, they can learn how to work appropriately with others, and it will make them more productive people in the future. Having an opportunity for more activities can encourage kids to try harder at school and become better people instead of being in your house trying to figure out what to do today.\n\nTo begin, working with teachers can give students more options to get more help or give others help if they are having rough times in school. They can go to teachers to ask what they are doing wrong and fix their mistakes they are making during class. Kids can also do extra credit work to raise their grade or just get a better understanding of what they are working on in class. They can also try out for more advanced work after school if they don't feel as challenged as they should to help them for better futures. Getting more help from teachers can make students smarter and feel less stressed once they actually realize what their teacher is writing on the whiteboard.\n\nNext, doing sports or clubs can teach students how to get along better working with others. It will help students make more friends so they don't feel left out or alone on a team when they are with more people because they might feel awkward. More kids will feel more comfortable acting like themselves in larger groups once they get to know everybody the proper way. It will also teach the kids teamwork and how to communicate with others and let them know how you feel like if you need their help learning a skill you don't have but they do. Working nicely with others can really give a person a good reputation around others.\n\nLastly, having more options to do in school makes students more productive and energetic people. Most kids will like to play sports with their friends and excerise instead of playing video games at home. Doing clubs gives an opportunity for kids to express themselves and be with the people who have the same interest as them which will make them more friends. Also, doing something like fundraisers for their school will teach them how to become better citizens and help with our environment. This would give students more energy to work hard and play harder than when they were younger because now they are more exercised.\n\nIn conclusion, we should have extracurricular activities for the students to have better futures by working well with others, practicing work from school or other things they arent the best at, and become harder workers and become more productive. The students will also have a better understanding of maybe a career path they would like to follow when they are older. The kids will get more practice at school than at home where parents might not give them the help they need so they will have activities at school. The more kids do these activities the more they will encourage other kids to do more of these activities. I think that all students should be required to do these extracurricular activities at school in order to prepare themselves for a future.",

    Essay: "Ever thought of how clubs could benefit people in any sort of way possible? Like how does it help people rather than waste their time? Well, joining clubs are actually extremely helpful to students. They should participate in extracurricular activities because it teaches them life skills, helps them manage their time, and it helps with their stress.\n\nJoining an club can teach these students many different life skills, such as teamwork. Teamwork is not something everyone learns throughout their lives. Some people are taught by their parents, but most of the time, teamwork is taught to people who experience it. Extracurricular activities often teach people how to succeed by working together. They teach it by forcing the students, in a good way, to work together. This is important because teamwork is a life lesson people must learn to excel in life. What I mean by that is, humans wouldnt even been alive if there wasnt someone there to help them. People work together in ways to create amazing inventions because of it. For example, if cavemen hadn't worked together to hunt for food, then we would've not even be here on this Earth. Teamwork was in the human nature long before any of us were alive, and it has proven to have advance the human race in all ways possible.\n\nParticipating in extracurricular actives require a lot of time management and responsibility. This is a great for students because many dont learn how to manage their time correctly. Managing time is probably the hardest skill to learn. It requires planning, and actually doing what was planned, and most of us would forget that we even had something up in our calender if not for time management. Having an activity can help get us to realize to keep track of time. How? By making people panic when they forget about the club that they signed up for. Time management also teaches the students responsibility. It teaches students responsibility by having them keep track of what they are doing next, and how much time to take on it. By participating in a club, it can help students become more responsible.\n\nAside from responsibility, reducing stress is also another one of the major point to join a club.\n\nStress takes a major part in a students life,but it also acts as a major issue for a lot of students' health. Many would get rid of stress by surfing the internet or sleeping. But isn't that just a major waste of time? Instead, they could join clubs that actually benefits then, rather than waste their lives. Joining a club can majorly benefit a students health by taking off all that stress.\n\nActivities such as sports or student council can help take their mind off of things, and just let them focus and have fun. It is proven that clubs help students to manage their stress through activities and games.\n\nReducing stress could also help with the students' concentration on other things. Without stressful thoughts, students can concentrate better on school work after they finished their club's.\n\nIn the end, joining a club or an activity is very beneficial to students. Extracurricular activities could teach students' teamwork by working together with other people. It can also help them by helping them manage their time and teach them responsibility. Joining an activity can help deal with a lot of stress, and help the students' concentrate better on school work. In the future, many schools will enforce a requirement; stating that students absolutely have to join a extracirruclar activity, because it benefits them a lot.",

When they get home they are on their phone or on the TV.\n\nAfter school activities are at least an hour or longer.\n\nSo if they get out of school at 3:35, with practice and the car ride they wont get home till around 4:50.\n\nIn addition, they might take a shower and they have to have dinner, so that takes a lot of screen time away.\n\nWith them doing an activity after school, it will get them away form their technology and they will be doing something productive.\n\nSecondly, with kids being on their phones all the time, they dont get a lot of face to face interactions.\n\nDoing an activity after school would help with getting that practice in.\n\nIt would force them to interact with other people and to make new friends.\n\nOnce kids get older they will not know how to look someone in they eye while talking, because they dont have to do that while testing someone.\n\nFinally, its the only time kids can get real physical activity.\n\nIn gym they don't get a lot of exercise.\n\nKids don't like having to participate in activities that dont enjoy, especially with people they don't know.\n\nIf they don't want to do something they wont put in any effort.\n\nAt least when they are on a team they make bonds and friendships so that they enjoy what they are doing and put in the effort.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that the principle should make kids participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nSo that while they are doing their extracurricular they are wasting their screen time.\n\nIt helps they practice the face to face interaction with people.\n\nLastly, so it gives them the physical activity they need.",

    Essay: "You are sitting in the gym during the boring assembly. You and your friends just want to get out and go to history, but then the principal says something that catches your attention, He says \" For now on, all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\" Everyone in the gym did not say a word because some of the kids did not want to do an extracurricular activity. You like this idea because it will allow students to have something to do after school, it will get rid of some stress for student, and it will make the student more responsible.\n\nIt will allow students to have something to do after school whether that be sports, band, yearbook, or even student council. If they do not do any extracurricular activity, what are they going to do. Either play video games or do stuff with their friends that they should not be doing. If every student does an extracurricular activity then they will have something other to do that sit on their couch watching TV and playing video games.\n\nDoing an extracurricular activity will get rid of some stress for some students. Whether they are stressed about homework, family, or friends, doing an extracurricular activity will make the stress go away for some students. If you do an extracurricular activity it will make it easier for the student because it allows them to let it all out. You could even practice when you are stressed even if it is just getting up and practicing your extracurricular activity.\n\nMaking you responsible inside and outside of school. Now at my school if you do not have good grades you can not play the next game. So if students were to participate in an extracurricular activity it would make them want to do their homework so that they can play in their next game or so. It will even make you responsible in your own home by making you want to do your chores so that your parents won't make you sit out your next game. So by being in an extracurricular activity it will make student more responsible.\n\nSo yes I do agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will allow then to have something to do after school, getting rid of stress for some of the students, and being responsible inside and outside of school. I wish that all school would do this for those reasons. It is a good idea because it will make students be a better person.",

    Essay: "Generic_Name\n\nYour principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.\n\nWould Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way.\n\nStudents should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a \"extracurricular activity.\" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation.\n\nMost Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there.\n\nIt needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a \"extracurricular activity\".\n\nI can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders.\n\nJumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude.\n\nLet me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts.\n\nSo in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity.\n\nInstead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",

    Essay: "How would you feel if I forced you to do something you absolutely did NOT want to do or maybe even couldn't do because of other circumstances? That is what this principal is doing here! I disagree with this decision because some kids need to be home for family things,others have diagnosed anxiety and can't function doing these types of things,last but not least kids might be frightful of bullying. Keep on reading and i'll explain just how wrong this is!\n\nThe first reason i think of is family. My family is very complicated and difficult however i am blessed in the aspect of having an adult at home to take care of anything(most of the time).However not every kid has that,let me elaborate. There is a kid named Generic_Name (this is all made up) and his mom works from 2:30 p. m.-10:30p. m. also on the other hand its very scarce for his dad to be around because his dad drives trucks for a living. Generic_Name has 3 younger brothers Generic_Name,Generic_Name,andGeneric_Name who he is responsible to take care of while his parents are not home. If he is staying after school daily then who will do it? You may just be thinking \"well why doesn't Generic_Name just hire a babysitter?\" his parents spend all the money they earn on bills,clothes and food,4 kids is tough to handle. This principal has to think about everyone and give perspective to all,including kids like Generic_Name.\n\nWhat about the kids that have things going on inside their head? Talking about mental health is a very personal thing for me and my family. Why you ask? Because My sister has a lot of mental illnesses that she struggled with all through school and still does in life to this day(she is 19 as of now).She has BPD and anxiety both diagnosed. I remember weeks she wouldnt eat or random nights screaming, some days happy others not. The reason i give such a personal back story is because i want you to understand that some of these children cannot cope in these situations and its not their fault,they did not choose this! The crowd in sports could frighten them or make them break down or the workload from school and their activity together could feel like to much for a young child to cope with. Again back to the principal needs to really try to give sympathy to some of these kids situations.\n\nHave you or someone you loved ever been bullied or had suicidal thoughts? I'm very lucky in the fact that i have never been in a situation where i felt i was being bullied however suicide hits very close to home. Just recently my uncle committed suicide and it is and forever will be a devastating loss to this world. The reason i mention suicide is because you never know whats going on in someones mind or what they are going through. If a kid gets picked on and is told he or she is everything but enough and amazing it gets to them just like any other human. If a heavier weighted kid is playing a sport and gets called names and gets picked on for his weight in the locker room he will feel down and start to question himself. It's not okay for anyone to feel that way! Im no perfect human iv'e said things to people that i regret but i try to be understanding and be nice most of the time. This principal needs to think about these kids and not the image of the school.\n\nThese kids should not have to feel these things or go through these things out of fear that they may get in trouble for not doing an activity ,it's just not right! Think about Generic_Name,my sister and the kid in the locker room the next time you see a bully or someone struggling with anxiety or hear about a difficult situation at home. I completely disagree with the principal for the reasons i just gave you. Where do you stand on the matter?",

Here is why I disagree.\n\nI think the school shouldn't enforce a rule for the students to do extracurricular activities because students may have things to do after school. Instead, the principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students who want to stay after school.\n\nI disagree with the principal's idea because students may have many things to do after school. For example, students may have to babysit their siblings, do sports, or simply have lots of homework to do when they get home. The principal enforcing a rule on the students making them do at least one activity makes it so that students don't have time to do what they need to do when they come home.\n\nThe principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students that don't have out of school activities. For example, Student help, clubs, or sport related activities. That way, students don't feel like it's a mandatory extra 2 hours of school but instead, it's an optional way of taking part in school activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the principal should not enforce the rule of making them stay after school because the kids may have to do out of school activties.

    Essay: "The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you disagree or agree with him that all students must participate. Because 1 out of 5 kids do not have extracurricular activities at there school. I agree because the kids can learn some thing new, have help on a topic, and to have fun.\n\nMy first reason is that the students can learn something new. When they stay for a new club they can make friends and learn the new skill that the club is teaching . The club is a good way to learn some new things, make some new friends, and learn how to use this skill in life. When you join a club you will learn to love it. For instance not a lot of people came to Girls Who Code until we started to tell everybody how nice and fun it was. Now people are racing for spots in Girls who code. People who come to Girls Who Code will learn about programs and how your favorite game was made.\n\nMy next reason is that the students can get extra help in the many of clubs. Some of the clubs such as homework club can help you study. The school provides many clubs to help you with all of your topics. When you come to certain clubs there will be tutors there to help. The tutors are your fellow students that show up to help there class mates. When you stay after to get help your grades will go up by a lot. When they do you will be proud of them that you came too homework club.\n\nMy final reason is that the students need to have fun in the clubs. when the parents leave ore work the student is home alone. when the stay after they can hang out with there friends. The different clubs have different activities for the students to learn and have fun. Some kids just want to hang out with other kids. Students have to have some time relax and have fun in the clubs.\n\nIn conclusion all students must participate in a extracurricular activity so they can enjoy the clubs that the school has to offer. When they participate in the clubs they will be more ready to learn about that subject.\n\nAll of the clubs are really fun and educational.\n\nYou schools join a club today",

    Essay: "Most people think extracurricular activities are a waste of time, but are they really a waste of time? I think extracurricular activities are a good thing for students because it helps with mental health like bringing kids out of their comfort zone. Another reason why I think extracurricular activities are a good thing is because it can help with students social skills, for example, they can interact with peers. Lastly another reason why extracurricular activities are beneficial is because studentsÃÂ´ can learn new things, for example, they can learn how to debate on topics. These are some reasons why I think extracurricular activities are beneficial because it helps with mental health, social skills, and for students learn new things.\n\nOne reason why extracurricular activities are good for students is because it helps with their mental health. An example would be it would help students come out of their comfort zone and make new friends. Another very good reason why extracurricular activities can help with mental health would be for students to be able to talk to someone outside of school hours to someone they trust and confide in. Lastly another very good example why extracurricular activities can be very good for students mental health would be for students to be able to interact more with other studentÃÂ´s because during school hours students do not have much time to interact with other studentsÃÂ´ except for in lunch and that is a very short amount of time. That is one way extracurricular activities can benefit students mentally.\n\nSecondly another reason why extracurricular activities are beneficial for students because it can help them with social skills. A reason why extracurricular activities can benefit students would be social skills. One example would be for students to make new friends. A second example would be it can help students interact better with peers and teachers. One last reason would be for students to learn good social skills for the future when they want to apply for college or apply for a job. That is a second example on why extracurricular activities can benefit students socially.\n\nLastly another reason why extracurricular activities are positive for students would be for students to learn new things if they join certain extracurricular activities. A good example would be for students to experience different types of views on certain topics and how to see different sides of the problem, how to work with those view points, and to respect someones opinion. The students would also learn how to debate on topics concerning the school, community, or world events and work on ways to figure out how to fix those issues. One last reason would be for students to learn how to represent their school and to influence other students from different schools to join clubs and make new friends. That is a third and final example on why extracurricular activities can benefit students on how to learn new things.\n\nExtracurricular activities are very important for students. They help students with their mental health and ways to make new acquaintances or friends. Extracurricular activities also helps with students social skills because students donÃÂ´t get much social time in school. And one last reason why itÃÂ´s very important for students to participate in extracurricular activities would be to learn new experiences.

    Essay: "I disagree with what the princicapel says since students here shouldn't be made do an curricular acitivity, it's uncostitutional.\n\nMaking Students do an extracurricular activivty will not work out since not all of the students at our middle school want to pick an activity to participate in.\n\nThis would looked at to be forced, since for the thew that don't pick an activity the school would have to choose a random activity for them to enjoy. I think if the school makes all the student do atleast one extracurricular activity it'll be like the school is forcing them to do it. Us students shouldn't be forced to do anything that's not part of the edjucation our school gives in the first place.\n\nThese activitys might be to much to handle for a student physically or mentally. Physically a student may not be able to compete in an activity such a an phisical sport due to a phisical or a mental condition. This is probably why the student didn't play the sport before the princaple made their decision.\n\nMentally this can also be rough on a student to particpate in an particular activity since it'd be more work for them handle arleady added on to the school work they already have. For example working on the year book all year and completing it before the deadline.\n\nIf a student doesn't play a sport or do anything woudn't they become lazy or even somewhat unhealthy. If you are asking this question you forgotten about the GYM class that all students are required to take at our middle school. Our GYM class activitys should provide every student to stay healthy and in shape here at our school. If a student wants to participate in an activity like playing a sport or joining a club it should be their choice and their parents choice to decide if they want to join in on an the activity or not. It shouldn't be the schools choice!\n\nStudents might improve socially and could have some fun their activity. Yes that is true but what if some or even most of the students don't enjoy their activity they're in. The proof for this is that this would happen a lot since the principle made the decicsion to have every student in a extra curricular activity whether they like it or not . I think that us students would be better off we can choose what we want to do, so we enjoy what we want to do.\n\nI think that students shouldn't have to particapate in a extracurricular activity in they don't want to.

Activity's arent always good for certain people they might need help on something or they feel sick, you cant always put school in front of everything. Activity's are great but you gotta make sure you are in the right state to do said activity.\n\nSchool activities are a great way to socialize but its also bad if a student gets too anxious or cant handle said activity you cant make the student do an activity. School isnt for activity's either its meant for learning about socializing, and learning something new, and activity's might get in the way of studying or trying to remember certain things. Its very important to make sure your students are well kept and helped and that there not worked up.\n\nAnxiety is a huge plus with school, there is many things to do and learn and adding to it might get a student worked up and its very important to keep a student feeling safe and knowing that there is help. I dont think its bad but i also say it isn't good there are pro's and con's to it and it depends on the student in general. You cant just focus on the student though you also have to worry about the parent and see what they say because there parent is the one that is giving the student the opportunity to do activities and if they dont like the idea maybe cast a vote.\n\nAll in all my opinion about making students do activities is a no for me there are good things about it but there is also bad things and making sure everyone is updated with the idea is a big step.

    Essay: "Does your school have extracurricular activities? Are you in any of them? Most schools in America have extracurricular activities on or off school grounds. The problem is that more than 50 percent of students dont engage in those activities. My principal wants that to change he is making extracurricular activities mandatory and i agree. 3 reasons are extracurricular activities can be fun, they give students a wider career path, and they can keep students open minded. I will explain why extracurricular activities can be fun, how they widen students career paths, and how they keep students open minded.\n\nFor my first reason, extracurricular activities can be fun. For example when i first entered sixth grade i had nothing to do. I was not in any sports and i wasnt engaged in extracurricular activities. That all changed when my friend convinced me to join soccer, my life changed for the better. I never knew how fun soccer was and i probably never would have if it wasnt for him. Students think that just because somthing looks boring it is boring, that is not always true and it can be the exact opposite.\n\nFor my second reason, extracurricular activities can widen a student career path. It can happen in two ways, the student discovers they have a hidden talent or they can find somthing they really like to do. When i was in seventh grade i had a friend who was really good at photography. You would never see him or his camera seperated from each other. So one day i told him about the yearbook club and he thought it would be great if he joined. He was so good at it he became the vice-president of the club within weeks. Ever since that day he has tried to get a career in photography.\n\nFor my third and final reason, extracurricular activities can keep students open minded. For example when i was in fifth grade my school got a number of sports introduced to it and tennis was one of them. I was already into basketball and i was never interested in tennis. I played basketball at home and not at school so when the school said all students must pick one sport i picked basketball. They didnt let me because there was already to many people so i picked tennis. I did not want to try somthing new but i didnt have a choice. When i went to my first practice i loved it, I never thought it would be this fun. Being in a new sport really made me experience somthing else and from that day i ws never afraid to change.\n\nPeople may disagree but extracurricular activities are amazing. I explained how they can be fun, how they can change students career paths, and they can keep students open minded. Many people dont know how fun it is to be in an extracurricular activity and i encourage people to join one. now you know why i agree with our principal and how his opinion can change people for the better.",

    Essay: "Many schools offer a variety of extracurricular activities that students can participate in. Although many students are recognized for all of the activities they do, some of their fellow students do not participate in any. There are many excuses children and teens come up with as to why they can't participate, but there are a couple logical reasons that support their case. If a principal made every student engage in an extracurricular activity, I would disagree. I do not think students should be forced to do certain activities because they may not have the money to participate, they may be shy and performing in a sport or club is out of their comfort zone, and they may not have enough time.\n\nStudents do not have to have a ton of money to engage in sports or clubs, but the costs for those activities, for example, jerseys, props, and fund raising expenses, can become overwhelming. If you are involved in sports there are many expenses that come with the honor. You have to buy the right shoes and clothes to practice in, but that's not all. Getting training lessons for the activity can be very expensive and a hard task to achieve. Also, their parents might want to use the money for other things that are important to them like a family vacation, or eating out. Lastly, they may be participating in an activity out of school that is expensive, and having to pay for both a school activity, and after school activity can be difficult.\n\nMany students are very shy and are not use to speaking up or performing in front of hundreds of people, and if it is your first time doing so, it can be very nerve-racking. Many teens know what they would have to experience if they participated, and after thinking about the hardships, they might decide to nothing at all. They may have an older sibling or friend to help them, but many students do not. Having a friend participate in the sport or club with you can be a great advantage, but some teens do not get that advantage. So forcing them to participate in an activity where they have no one to talk to during practice or to cheer them on, can make the activity seem boring.\n\nFinally, the student many not have enough time. Some parents work late so finding a ride home or getting everything prepared for the activity can be hard. Also, a lot of students work on homework after school, if they played a sport or participated in a club, they may not have enough time to accomplish their studies, which in my opinion is the most important task of all. Students may not manage their time wisely. Finishing homework, participating in an activity, and still having a little free time at the end of the day is a lot to juggle. Without unlimited time on your hands, he or she may feel overwhelmed and stressed, which can lead to bigger problems.\n\nTo conclude, although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders.",

    Essay: "Students deserve a break from school altogether. Being loaded with homework day and night, puts pressure on them, let them relax and take a break, to enjoy themselves. So, I do have to agree and disagree on that decision. Let me persuade you not to frement this decision, by telling you the main reasons why I say no and yes .First, kids are not machines, don't overwork them with more school, Let them choose if they can or want to do a extra class, show them that they can make their own choices thoughtfully. And most importantly , let kids be kids whatever they choose to do.\n\nParents know how to work their kids, especially if they don't want to do the work themselves. But , ease down on the chore list, kids already got it bad enough with homework. Spending all of their time studying, keeping their grades just to make you proud. Kids also need to have fun, like after school they can hangout with their friends, not add an extra class of more work to make them miserable, they already spend so much studying on a regular basis, let them relax and unwind , to be free and calm. Kids are hard- working , give them some credit for what they've already done in the school year.\n\nIf your kids want do an extra class, go right ahead ! It's the path that they want to take if they think they can do it , let them. One of the reasons I would approve of this decision is becuase knowing that your child will put anything that their mind can do. Shows determination, progress of their mental and physical strength , responsibility one of the biggest , most important traits you will need to learn in adulthood. Make sure to prepare yourself , cause your kid is growing up.\n\nWe all love our kids. We all want what is best for them, protecting them from the pressure on the real world, an extra class might help to show the struggles of balancing work in the real world. Then again , some kids just need to relax from working so hard, just let kids be kids, whatever you ( the principal ) choose ,has to benefit every kid to suceed in the school year. They have already done so much , don't put pressure on them or deprive them of another class that could be needed in life. Don't overwork the future , the future are our kids.\n\nMy decision was to pick between yes and no well I have made my choice. I think the extra classes should be an option. So that if any kid wants to do the class, they have the privillage and the chocie, and if not ,they don't have to, by not putting pressure on them to keep another grade up. Kids need to make their own decisions based on their needs and/or wants. They are responsible and capable.\n\nOur kids are progressing to the future, making their own decisions, to show us for themselves that they can get through school without depending on anyone. Proving that they can do this, and do this they can. Kids are special , let us give them the credit and graditude of their accomplishments. Hey , maybe they'll even be gald they had the option , instead of forcing them upon another stack of homework to do.

As a result, I believe that schools should have the rule, that each student should have to participate in one extracurricular activity throughout the year. This way kids can try new things, help the school and the community, and create new relationships. As school comes to an end, they will have gone out of there comfort zone and have tried something new.\n\nOne of the benefits of extra curricular activities is the ability to try new things, one of these options is sports, kids are allowed to choose from a plethora of sports from soccer, basketball, and many more. What is so significant about each sport is that it brings together kids through team bonding. On the other hand sports isn't the only team bonding activity, there is also theater. Theater is one of the few activities where students are allowed to preform and express themselves through art. Where each student is given a role that influences the play in some way. Another activity can be designing. Schools are very active when it comes to promoting their extracurricular activities, and one way they do this is through art. When doing designing students are able to promote other activities by creating posters or even designing the year book. Extracurricular activities can seem like a big hassle and not worth while but are a great way to introduce students to new things.\n\nExtracurricular activities are not only good for trying new things, but are beneficial for the community and school. There are many ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, one is working for the city council. Working for the city council is a tough tasks. You help by participating and working with the City Board, where you can help make decisions for your community. Another activity is community service, community service is a great way to help you community out, from picking up trash to helping local people. One way you can help the school is by help building props for theater. This is a crucial role when it comes to theater, because you give a scene for the play to help make it come alive. The beneficial outcomes are great way to tie together the students to the school and the community.\n\nBut the most important things that extracurricular activities do, is bring people together. Sports is one of many where they bring people together through competition. Another is theater where they work together to create a work of art for our enjoyment, and helping the community, where they meet new people and help them with there needs. People may think extracurricular activities are not for everyone, but there are ways that it can help you try new things, help the school and community, and even create new relationships.",

    Essay: "Generic_Name used to be shy, but he joined basketball after school and made a lot of new friends and became so much more happier and gained a lot of confident as well. I agree that students should participate in an extracurricular activities because students can play sports they enjoy, get homework and tests done, and meet new people.\n\nMost students like to pick sports as their extracurricular activity because it is fun and students get to pick the sports they like the most such as basketball, soccer, volleyball, football, and floor hockey. Doing sports as your extracurricular activity can help you get into better shape and physically stronger. Students are usually stressed and want to go to bed after school but going out to run or playing a game can force their brains wake up. Playing sports can help with your sleeping because you've used up all your energy and in the morning you will wake up felling refreshed and energized.\n\nWe all have subjects were good and bad at and need more help than others. Staying after in a homework club or with a teacher can make a huge difference to your learning and your understanding. If you stay after with a teacher they can help you one on one and talk to you through your work step by step, and it will show your teacher that you are willing to try and it will motivate the both of you to put an effort in. When you miss a day or two because you were sick it can be hard to catch up on all the work you've missed and the teacher can't sit with you one on one during class because they have to teach a new lesson to the class, so staying after can give the teachers a chance to sit with you one on one so they can help you catch up. We all take tests but sometimes we don't have enough time to finish or had a hard time with the test and need more time but you can't miss your next class, but you can stay after and finish the test and refresh your memories and go over the notes you have. Staying with a homework club can let you work on work with your friends you are struggling with and work on group projects together.\n\nStaying after in a club is a good idea because you can do activities you like to do such as art, chess, book club, computer arts, and music class. Some of the clubs may not be something you can have as your classes and you really enjoy doing them. When you stay after you can pick which activity you want to go to. Going to these clubs will allow you to meet new people with the same interests with you and you'll have something to talk about, you can make a lot of new friends too.\n\nHaving an extracurricular activity is good to be in and can benefit you in many ways. An activity that is enjoyable for most people is sports because you can play any sport you want and it can help get your energy out. Staying with a teacher can be helpful in many ways but it can help you get a better understanding, get tests done, missing assignments, and can help get you grade up. Another way extracurricular activities can benefit is you is that you can make new friends and enjoy classes that aren't always available to you. In conclusion I agree that students should have an extracurricular active they enjoy because it can help then get into better shape, get homework and tests completed, and to make friends in classes that are fun and exciting.",

    Essay: "Most schools don't make their students participate in after school activities, but mine dose.\n\nI don't agree with the choice and hears why.\n\nStudents have to sit at school and behave for eight hours a day. So when its time to finally time to go home and spend time with family and relax were excited. When you make us do extracurricular actives we don't get that time at home to relax and spend time with are family. I think we sometimes forget that everyone needs there own personal time to them self.\n\nAlthough thats a big part of why I disagree with my principal I still have more to say. Some students may not have a ride to these extracurricular actives or a ride to get back home. Which could bring stress to the students parents. I may not be a parent myself but I know being a parent can be very stressful. Many parents work late night shifts. In which they can't be there to pick up their son or daughter.\n\nMy third and most important reason is that kids should be kids. We deserve to go outside and play and play video games. We deserve a childhood not being a miniature adult with lots extra tasks to do and think about. We need this time now to grow and be kid because in the real world they're a much bigger consequent then being grounded. Theses extracurricular activities are taking up all our time and a lot of us don't even like the activity we have.\n\nAll in all, we should'nt be forced to do something we don't want to. It should be optional to join a extracurricular activity. I just wish my principal would have looked at his chose from different points of view.",

It is important that this decision was made because students would not sign up on there own.\n\nAn option that students have when they sign up is after school sports. After school sports are important because it is where most students get physical activity other that PE. Not only do students get physical activity but they also learn how to stay healthy and fit, and they start developing habits of exercise. Students also learn how to work with there team to advise plans or solve issues. Working as a team can be helpful to some students because they have each other to back them up and point things out that the other person did not realize.\n\nAnother option that students have, is to serve in the student council. The student council can be helpful to some people, because it teaches you valuable skills. Some skills the student council teaches you is to be responsible and trust worthy. Students who are a part of the student council are tying to make there school a better place, and they often have people counting on them so they have to be trust worthy and accountable. That can teach students as well because they know that they are being counted on and they have to step up.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the principles decision because students will get a chance to stay after school with there friends to get physical activity,interact with other students and learn to help there community.",

    Essay: "Recently the principle made a big change to our school. He decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. After I heard about this, I started thinking of how this can impact our school. Some students might disagree with this new change, but I actually agree with the principle's decision. There might be some minor ways on how this can effect students, however, I think this could be a great way to improve students mental health. Students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity because this could make students more productive, help students find something they might be passionate in, and have a great way to make new friends.\n\nThe first reason why I agree with the principle is because it can make students more productive after school. There are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. Most of the time, I can be one of those students. Usually when I come home after school, I always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. When I get on my phone, I can get so invested in it, that I don't even realize I have a lot of homework assignments to do.\n\nBeing lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. Most students probably have been in the same situation as me. Although, if those students were to be in a extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. For example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. Another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. Doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device. To sum up, extracurricular activities are a good way to help someone have a productive task to do.\n\nThe second reason why I agree with the principle is because extracurricular activities can help some students find something to be passionate in. There are some students who might not have any activity or hobby they're passionate in. If those students had to take an extracurricular activity, they would have a more chance of finding something they like. Some students might even end up liking an activity they never thought they would. Every school gives many options in extracurricular activities. If a student tries out an activity and they don't like it, they can always try a different one. Also, another benefit in finding a activity you like, is getting a lead to a career you might want to have in the future. It's always good to know what you're passionate in, so you can have more options for future careers.\n\nThe final reason why I agree with the principle is because joining in extracurricular activities can be a great way to make new friends. Socializing and making friends is important for anyone's mental health. Friends can be supporting and a helping hand at any time. The friends you make can also build a strong character in you. If you join an extracurricular activity that you really like, it can be easier to make friends because they will have the same interest as you. Because of the similar interests, the friends you make through an activity can be more closer than the friends you make in class. Making friends gets you to know other people in your school, and it's better to know more people so you can feel more comfortable at school. All in all, extracurricular activities can be the best opportunity in making great friends.\n\nThere may be other ways that extracurricular activities can benefit students, but the reasons I thought of were the most important to me. With extracurricular activities students can be more productive, find an activity they might be passionate in, and make new friends. Also, extracurricular activities can play a important role in life by leading you to a career. For the students who don't agree in partaking in any activity, just keep in mind that It's always better to try new activities because you might end up liking it!",

    Essay: "Let's imagine you are the best player in your grade at basketball. You're in the ninth grade and have dominated ever since you started playing. One day a friend walks up to you and asks, \"Do you want to play after school basketball with me and work on our skills?\" You respond, \"No, because I'm already the best! Why would I try to get better when I'm already better than everyone?\" Your friend says back to you, \"So that you can perfect your skills and get better at other skills.\" You say, \"I'm not going to work on my moves because I'm already good enough.\" You keep this mindset throughout high school. By the time you're a senior you are kicked off the team because you don't show up to practice and are one of the worst players on your team. That is because you thought you were always the best, and never practiced basketball. As other kids were gaining skills, you stayed the same and over time, you were losing skills.\n\nYour principal has just decided to force students to do extracurricular activities after school. Some students are unhappy because they don't think they need to do these activities and would rather be at home. These kids are likely not as engaged or don't have as good of a presence in the community because they don't want to do these activities.\n\nMost students, are fine with this because they go to after school activities already. These students are more engaged with their peers and teachers because of the extra work they do with them.\n\nI agree with the principal because students should do after school activities to help make a good work ethic, be a better member in the community, and to do physical/mental activity regularly.\n\nKids who do extracurricular activities have better work ethics because they're used to doing extra work to achieve what they want to achieve. They know what they want and will work hard to get it. These students have stay after talk with teachers, peers, and other members of the school community to help be a better student or athlete. They also understand what it takes to complete their goal in their extracurricular activity.\n\nThese kids are also better members of the community because, for example, if you are in year book you know what is happening in the school community. If you know what is happening in the community then you know how to make it better and make yourself better. When you are a positive figure in your community, people tend to trust you more often and are more friendly in general. It helps you more than it hurts you when you know you're a good figure in your community.\n\nIf you do after school basketball then you're doing mental and physical activity every time you are there. You get benefits by just running around in basketball because it keeps you in shape for other sports. It also helps you mentally because you have to know plays. If you do both physical and mental activity then you are doing your after school activity correctly.\n\nIn short, extracurricular activities are very important and should be used by every student. It helps students mentally and physically. It helps them become good figures in their community. It helps them build bonds with teachers and students. Extracurricular activities are very positive things for students to do and should be used by most, if not all students.",

    Essay: "My principal has decided that all students are required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and I think its a great Idea! Extracurricular activities are actually a great thing for students to get involved in for many reasons. Requiring all students to do extracurricular activities results in students either getting more exercise or using their brain more depending on what they choose, and it will make them more likely to get into college. Students who were skeptical of joining anything extracurricular will finally understand what its like to be a part of something like that and I think most of them will enjoy it.\n\nStudents engaging in activities that require a lot of physical activity such as sports, will be more physically fit and most likely healthier than those who do not. If someone decides they want to sign up for yearbook or student council, they will have the opportunity to greatly improve their problem solving skills. Anyone having engaged in either of these will understand what its like to work with a group of people to work together to achieve a common goal. This will allow students to better understand how to exist in the real world and how to work at their future jobs.\n\nAnyone who does an extracurricular activity and in this case everyone going to my school will have a better chance of going to college. Colleges see if and what you have done in terms of extracurricular stuff, because they don't want someone who they think will do the bare minimum and barely get through. Colleges care about their image. So as far as the colleges are concerned good students equals good looks and good looks equals more demand college which equals more money. Part of that image is sports, in fact if you are good enough at a specific sport so much that they want you to be on their team they will pay for you to go to their college, this is called a scholarship. The better the students a college gets the more attractive it looks, the more students my high school sends to college the more attractive my high school looks and the students have a higher chance to go to college, its a win, win, win!\n\nI feel that it is important in high school to be a part of something like a sport, or yearbook, or student council. The sense of community and common interest in a large group of people can really make you feel at home and be a nice thing to look forward to after a long day of school, even if it might be taxing physically or mentally. In anything extracurricular everyone knows everyone, they're all friends united by a common passion and a common goal. This builds strong compromising skills and cooperative skills.\n\nThe principles decision makes kids do something that they will most likely actually really enjoy, something that will very much assist them in getting into college, and something that will allow students to understand how to survive in the real world. It will also benefit my high school and any college any current student at my school goes to in the future. In conclusion, the decision to make all students required to do an extracurricular activity was a fantastic one.",

    Essay: "Imagine if your principal told you that all students will have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Would you agree or disagree? I think I would Agree with the principal. My three reasons why are; exercise, socialization, and having something else to do.\n\nWhen I say exercise, I don't just mean physically. Exercising the brain is something many different clubs do. Even football and basketball require a sharp brain to be able to make strategies and avoid obstacles. Chess club is another great way to exercise your brain. But you can also be exercised physically by extracurricular activities. swim teams, soccer teams, and other sports teams are all great ways to bet kept active.\n\nIn this day and age, sometimes it is hard to be social. Electronics and social media take up our time and we can't talk to others like we used to. Being in a club, however, you can talk and have fun with others your age. No distractions except for what you are doing in that certain club. People could give you tips on how to improve, or vice versa.\n\nSome students,after school, dont have anything else to do when they get home, setting aside chores, eating, and sleeping. Being in a extracurricular activity would give these students something to do and somewhere to be. So instead of them being couch potatoes at home, they could be outside running drills, having meetings, or even having a game/ performance.\n\nWhat would you do if your principal told you that from now on, you had to participate in an extracurricular activity. Would you agree or disagree? If I were put into this scenario, i would agree with the principal. the reasons why are; exercise, being social, and having other things to do.",

I have done several activities in my life, so my essay will be biased. I agree with my principals decision, because participating in an extracurricular activity can benefit your grades, health, and you may discover new friends.\n\nYou can participate in something like an after school club to improve or maintain your grades. If you need help on schoolwork then you could go to something like a homework club; that would count as an extracurricular activity and you could be productive at the same time. Another bonus of doing an activity is that it could teach better time management. Since you would most likely choose a hobby to participate in if you were forced to do an extracurricular activity; you would want to get your work done and keep your grades up so that you can enjoy the activity. If you try out or join a team for sports that's great too. Sports can teach you to be a team player and responsibility; both of which can help keep your grades up. Group projects are sometimes hard to work on because someone does not want to participate, but if everyone learns to work together then you can get the project done. Eighth graders are always forgetting things, and learning responsibility can help them keep track of homework and schoolwork better.\n\nHealth is important, otherwise we wouldn't have a class on it. Engaging in any activity outside of school can make you happier in school, because you will be looking forward to whatever activity you are doing. Another reason you should participate in an extracurricular activity is, when your brain needs breaks from thinking about school, and what better way than to join a club or sport! Either one can get your brain looking at certain things from a new angle. Participating in any extracurricular activity can also help you get engaged in the community and world around you.\n\nEveryone wants a friend right? What better way than to find someone who has the same hobby or interest as you. It can be hard to make friends sometimes, but that shouldn't stop you from trying. You may be able to narrow the search for a friend by finding something you enjoy doing and find someone who has the same interest as you. It's also nice to have a friend who you can have a long conversation about what you both enjoy. If you join a club or sport, and then find one of your other friends that you didn't know would be there, thats fun and exciting. You discovered that you and your friend like the same thing and just didn't know it, but you never know until you put yourself out there a little.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why I agree with the principals decision to make everyone do one extracurricular activity. These are the points I would use to pursuade people to support the principal. I agree, because participating in an extracurricular activity can benefit your grades, health, and you may discover new friends.",

    Essay: "Today kids are nowhere near as social, productive, or getting as much exercise as they used too, but a principle has come up with a new plan to get kids involved again. By requiring students to involve themselves in a extracurricular activity that has many benefits in place for them.\n\nSince the rise of gaming and social media many kids have scaled back on hanging out with their friends or going to social events like teen night, because they would rather sit at home on their phones or watch YouTube. I think it would be a huge improvement if kids had to do an extracurricular activity. Kids that do extracurricular activities could make new friends that have the same interests as them. Because what if there is a kid who is shy and really wants to play basketball but he has nobody to play with or feels he will have nobody to talk to but now the school starts having all the kids do an extracurricular activity and he joins the basketball club and make lots of new friends that he can now hang out with and play basketball with.\n\nTherefore kids are not getting outside enough or being productive with their time if kids do at least one extracurricular is kids today with all these electronics are not being as productive as they should be. With an extracurricular activity kids could be outside because there could be a gardening club where kids could help plant flowers or tress and learn everything about how to keep a healthy garden they would also be out in the sun getting vitamin C which is great for the body where as a large number of kids sit inside and watch TV or play video games in a dark room with a bright screen flashing at them constantly which is not good for the brain nor the eyes\n\nMy next reason in why I support the idea is because kids today are not getting enough exercise as they should be instead they sit at home. If kids were required to do an extracurricular activity such as a running cub where they could track how much they run and for how long kids could track their exercise and then try to improve with more challening thing like maybe they run for longer or mabe they do the same workout on the track but after they go and run hills.\n\nIn conclusion I think kids should be required to do a least one extracurricular activity to help with social skills, increase productivity time, time outdoors or getting exercise. I believe this is a great opportunity for students to try new things and trying something even if it ends up not being you thing isn't going to hurt anything.",

    Essay: "Rumble rumble rumble\" the after school bus roars to life as it carries uninterested students back home from a long day at school. I would love to just relax at my house, catching up on homework, or taking a small nap. Nobody should be forced upon to do an extracurricular activity.\n\nAfter a day of school, some kids would be too busy to stay after.\n\nI would fall under that category. By that I mean I already have after school events. For example, I play two sports which are soccer and basketball. I also have religious education once every week. I know that I am not the only one who feels this way. Some children could be interested in partaking in a different hobby. They might want to try something new. One of my friends is interested in playing lacrosse. She would be too tired to go out to skills evaluation because she was working at school all day. Young men and women may not even have the time for it. They already have commitments such as: practices, religion practice, homework, and other responsibilities that they need to accomplish at home. When I stay after school, I only have a little bit of time to eat dinner before I get dragged to my next activity.\n\nHowever, it's not just whether or not pupils have the time and energy for extracurricular events, interest is another factor of the problem. The purpose of after school is to have students pick what they want to do and to have fun doing it. It is entirely upon the child's decision if they want to go home at regular school hours. I definitely do not like to stay at school any longer if I don't have to. I prefer to go home, and to be productive there. Some kids just aren't persuaded to participate in any of the options that after school has to offer. I am only intrigued by only a mere amount of events that goes on. Some of which don't last all year, or starts later in the year. For example, the girls' basketball team does not start until halfway through first semester. I, along with other pupils want to simply relax from a productive day's work. We may have had a bad day earlier, and we just want to go home and decompress. On my free days in which I don't have any activities post school, I love to take advantage of that and to lie down onto my bed and listen to music. Or, I can head over to a friends house and we can enjoy what little hours we have until we need to get rest for the next day.\n\nIt's not just how the young scholars feel, it is upon the parents' schedule as well. Some guardians may have work later than usual, and they might not get back until late at night. Or some, have to leave for work around the time that their child is coming home, they can't be late for their job and their kid does not posses the house key. As the guardian(s) would be at work, who could pick up the student? Late buses do not run everyday. But even if it did, the child could easily miss the bus for numerous reasons: not being able to hear their bus number called, being sent out late, or simply forgetting what bus number they are. There is also the possibility that the event let them out much earlier than the time to board the buses, someone would have the obligation to come and pick up the young man or woman. Not all post events are free, some come with fees. Perhaps an activity has a costly amount of money behind it. Not everyone could afford it, thus the pupil could not take part in the action. If the parents could not support the funding of this event, then the scholar would have to choose another post school meeting to do. Which may lead to the parent feeling remorse.\n\nHaving to participate in something that is being forced upon is not a good feeling. Kids should partake in an event because they feel good doing it, not because they had to do it.",

    Essay: "Do you participate in any after school activities? Well if you don't now you have to, my principal if making it mandatory to participate in at least one after school activity. You can participate in many activities such as sports teams, student council, and the debate team. There are many points for why this shouldn't be a rule in school. Some points are time management, interest, and funds/workers.\n\nMy first point is about time management, if students are doing extra activities they might not have time to do other important things. One of these important things is homework, if there doing activities they don't have time to do the homework a teacher assigned. This would lead the student to be behind in there classwork and cause there grade to drop. The second important thing they wouldn't have time to do is there chores. A lot of kid have chores and if there not done there parents will not be happy. This leading to the kid getting in trouble and getting a punishment.\n\nMy second point is interest, if there is no activities that interest the student there not going to have fun. And if they are not having fun they will slack off and not try there best. If a student doesn't want to do a activity that may cause them to make there own fun and act out and get into trouble. Then there parents would be angry and they would get in more trouble and the teachers would be angry because if the kid got Saturday school the teacher have to come watch them. Plus if they get in trouble that will mess with there record.\n\nMy third point is funds and workers, if you have more activities you need more money and more people to work them. And the school would have to ask the county for more money and the county might not have that amount of fund for the school. And you have to find the people to work those activities witch may be hard to do. And the schools may not be big enough for the activities to all be housed there. And that means they might have to rent a space for a activity to be held and that cost more money.\n\nThat is my three points on why I thing it would not be a good idea to make it mandatory for every student to participate in a after school activity. I already participate in a after school activity but I hope it is never mandatory. It would not achieve what school want witch is to keep kids active. It would only make the problem get worse and wouldn't fix it at all. The three points are funds/workers, interest, and time management.",

But the other student they dont like to do any of that but they are being focus to do stuff.\n\nThe principal should not focus the kids to do something they don't what to do the principal should ask if they what to do it or not.

    Essay: "My principal has decided to make a rule to where all students must participate in a extracurricular activity.\n\nI agree they should, the students can join a student council.\n\nThey can get more involved in school, they can make their selves more known in school, and it can be better later in life.\n\nIf going by the better later in life example, it will look good on college and job applications.\n\nIf the students were to get in a extracurricular activity, student council for example, they would get more involved in school.\n\nThey would know all thats going on in their school. Students could help out their peers if they need to know something important.\n\nThey can also help in school fundraisers or maybe if the school helps out Children Hospitals or homeless shelters they can help out them as well.\n\nGetting more known is also a plus for some people.\n\nIt gives the students more opportunities to do things for their school and outside of their school.\n\nIf more teachers know about the students and all they do for their school they would most likely recognize those students. Outside of school you could also get well known for do the right things an helping out people and being that person that everybody should be to help out.\n\nJoining a extracurricular activity can also be better for the students later in life.\n\nCollege applications is a good example, if you want to go to a certain college then you need the grades for it and if they see that you have been in a extracurricular activity then they will look at you a little more.\n\nAnother one is job applications, it's the same as the college applications almost.\n\nWhen you apply for a job and they take your job application and they see that you have participated in a activity like student council they will want you to be there because they want somebody who will be a leader and not be a follower.\n\nJoining a extracurricular activity can be beneficial.\n\nSo I agree with my principal on making a rule where the students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The principal is trying to help their students out if they take their advice they can go a long way in life. They can get into their favorite college and get their dream job.\n\nSo just take your principals advice they are really trying to help you out.",

    Essay: "The principle deciding that you have to do an extracurricular activity is like your parents choosing clothes for you and then they say that you have to wear them. Most people don't want to participate in extracurricular activities because they already have too much to do and they don't have the time. I disagree with the principle because students may have other things to do outside of school, there may not be anything that interests the students, and the students may already have other activities that they participate in.\n\nOne reason I disagree is because students could have other things to do outside of school. The students could be babysitting their siblings, doing homework, hanging out with friends, or the may have a part-time job to earn money. For example, my older sister couldn't participate in extracurricular activities because she had to babysit me and she had her own homework to do. Sometimes my sister hung out with her friends, as well. Babysitting requires attention of the sitter, and doing homework takes concentration.\n\nThere may not be anything that interests the student. Some activities could be limited and may only be there for a few days. In some schools there are things like that. There's an after school activity that you could go to and it's not there for more then a few days. One of my friends went to an activity and the day after she was happy and sad at the same time. She told me that there was a new club there and that it was really fun. She then added on and said that it's only there for two more weeks. She didn't go to after school, unless a teacher asked her to be there.\n\nAnother reason is that the student could already have other activities that they participate in. The student could already have sports to play, like soccer, basketball, baseball, or football. They could also be on one of the schools sport team and could already be there for the training. For example, I have a cousin and he is in high school. He is also on the schools soccer team and he has to be stay after school everyday for two hours. Once he gets home, he does his homework, eats, and then goes to bed. So, he doesn't have the time or energy for extracurricular activities.\n\nIn conclusion, having to do extracurricular activities is not a good idea. Students have other things to do, they may not like what choices they're being offered, and they may already have activities that they are participating in. The principles decision is like your parents choosing clothes for you because it may be nice, but you don't want it. You may be happy about it in the beginning but then you realize that you didn't have a choice in the matter.",

And if kids socialize more less kids would be shy. Plus more kids will have something to do after school.\n\nAlso when you find the extracurricular you want to do then while your doing it you could make more/new friends. i mean look at all the clubs there endless, so no mater what you like theres a club or activity for you. And if you dont like any of the clubs you can always try something new. and somehow you always learn something when you try something new.\n\nLast year i played football and i learned that its not just throwing and catching the ball. you have to memorize plays and routes, and sometimes thats alot of plays to remember. and theres not just sports say you like playing chess as an example theres a club for that to.\n\nso in conclusion the reason i think everyone should do extracurriculars is because, it would be fun and you would learn. and it would help people that are shy make friends. so yes i think it would help kids become better people.",

    Essay: "The Principle has decided to mandate every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, but is it a good idea? I think that the pros can eventually outweigh the cons if these tools are used properly. The social impact, impact on interests, and future impact can be very useful in their futures.\n\nFirst of all, how much of an impact these activities is pretty cool when you think about it. One reason is because many students will be able to make friends in these activities, because everyone there shares at least one interest. It opens them up to people with similar interests which could be very helpful in making friends. Another reason is because these activities will give them time to hangout with their previously-made friends, or their new friends they just met. Last reason I will mention is stress levels. Their stress could get significantly lower, because they are hanging out with friends which usually makes people happier and with that they become more approachable. That is why the social impact it can have is positive.\n\nSecond of all, the impact it can have on interests is a positive one. The activities can help these student find new interests, and that gives them something to look forward to, fight for, and relax with. With these new found interests or pre-existing ones, they can develop those interests and keep building on them. Last reason is that these interests and hobbies developed in their adolescence years can open up and create future job opportunities but I will get to that in a bit. Those are a few positive ways this idea would impact interests.\n\nLast reason it the impact on their futures. They might be able to make good, loyal lifelong friends, and if not lifelong at least long term, because they will be surrounded with people of similar interests and will most likely become more approachable. Like I mentioned before, this idea will be able to create job opportunities. For example, if one kid really likes computers but never thought about learning programming, with this new idea, they will be able to decide on programming and develop that interest. They might go to college for it and get a job in programming for a major tech giant. Another kid might already play soccer but with this extracurricular activity idea, it will open them up to a more talented pool of player where they can develop their craft and go pro. Last but not least, it can improve their time management skill. Some kids will be forced to manage their time more efficiently now that they have more on their plate. At first that might not sound like a good idea, but these extracurricular activities wont take priority, and this isnt as important as losing income because you got fired, or not being able to do something because you forgot. They will be able to decide on how to best manage their time and what works for them.\n\nThe Principle brought up a good talking point with this idea, that can be looked at in many different view points. My opinion on this is that it should be implemented for all of the reasons above. The positive impacts that this idea can have on their social life, interests, and future are undeniable and are what make this a good enough idea.",

    Essay: "School has many extracurricular activities. Such as sports, clubs, councils, and more. Although these activities sound amusing and fun, some kids might not like it or find any interest in them. Maybe they want to go home or hang out with friends like a pack of wolves. I disagree with the decision of making students participate in after school activities because some kids wouldn't be interested, they may have other things to do, and they want to have time to spend with family.\n\nWhen some kids do sports or other activities, they may start to lose interest. Take Basketball or Football for example, most kids and adults love playing or watching the sport on TV. But to some kids when they play or watch it, the interest in that sport will start to go away because of the repetition that's going on in the game. The reason behind this is because kids find other things for amusement. For instance, art. Art gives kids the ability to let their imagination run free and create wonderful pictures and ideas for a comic or art picture. Plus, kids can have fun with drawing instead of staying at school longer for an activity that has no interest to them.\n\nMost of the time students have backpacks that are filled with homework and are expected to complete it by tomorrow. The problem with that is most students are participating in an after school sporting event or have something else going on, which will make the student to feel stressed. Feeling stressed occurs when a child or adult starts to panic due to the time they have and how much work they are required to do. Because of the amount of homework they have, some students will stay up through the night in order to complete the work for the day. Also, due to the students staying up at night working on homework, they don't get the required sleep that a person needs to have before the next day. Which is why some students don't want to do extracurricular activities, they want to get the homework out of the way so they can do whatever they want for the rest of the day.\n\nKids want to try to spend as much time as they can with their family all the time. whether if they have a little bit of homework or it's a free day. Because most parents are working people and have to travel most of the time, so when the kids get off the bus to go home, they're most likely to be home alone because their parents are still working. Or they are out running errands before they get home. Plus, when the kids get to their parents after a long day, they to try and spend as much time as they can before the parents' children become teenagers and leave the house for college. Like a life cycle of a duck, the baby ducks try to stay with their mommy before they grow into adult ducks and go out on their own.\n\nI disagree with the decision of making students participate in after school activities because some kids wouldn't be interested, they may have other things to do, and they want to have time to spend with family. Students should be able to choose if they want to take part in an after school activity or not participate in one. Students of all ages have their own interests and other activities they find amusing. Because everyone is different, have different ideas, and do different things on their free time. In conclusion, students should be able to choose if they want to do an after school activity or not and not have a requirement of doing an extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "Have you ever been forced to do something that you dont want to do? A principle has decided to make students be, at least one, extracurricular activity. as it may sound nice, it's not as nice as you think it is? Some students aren't able to pay for those activities, most students are already a part of an activity, and other physically blocked to play sports. Now you should already have a different opinion then you have now.\n\nFirst, you should know that some parents or guardians aren't able to pay for extracurricular activities. Most parents don't have enough money to pay for activities. Some can't buy the items you would need to play the sport. Others can't pay the fees to go to the games or to start the sport. Parents may not want to their kids to play sports so they can save up for other needs like college and other needs.\n\nSecond, students may already have a sport that they do outside or school. Some students don't like the sport options that their school has, so they do other outside of school. For instance, if you wanted to learn how to ride a horse you would usually have to go to another place to learn how to do ride a horse. Students should be able to do the sport they want to do for a living and school can get in the way if they needed to do an extra sport. They need to practice their sport if they want to do it for a living.\n\nLast, some students aren't able to physically do any sport. Most students who can't do sports have a sickness that can't go away. Sicknesses can keep a kid away from doing sports. Asthma is a bad one that can be bad enough to where you can't run at all. Cancer can make someone not able to do sports or really anything physical. These kids who have sicknesses have a tough time already and it will be even harder if schools make you do extracurricular activities.\n\nNow you should have a different opinion about this topic. Students should not have to do an extracurricular activity. They should be able to do any sport they want. Students don't need any more stress about school.",

    Essay: "Many schools offer extracurricular activities for students to participate in. An extracurricular activity is a club, team, or other group that meets before or after school, such as playing football or acting in the school's musical. If my principal were to require each student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with his decision because it would teach students about responsibility, students would have more opportunities to make friends, and it could benefit their college applications.\n\nExtracurricular activities can teach responsibility because they often have deadlines, meetings, and things that must be turned in. Being responsible is necessary to function as a human, especially if you are part of a club or team. If you miss a deadline, you could face getting removed from the group. If you skip a meeting, you may miss important information, and if you forget to turn in money, you probably won't be able to participate in the next big event. Children must learn how to be responsible at a young age, and extracurricular activities are a great way to teach it.\n\nHaving friends in school is crucial for a child. Children need to have someone to talk to, play with, and trust. When you participate in an extracurricular activity, it opens the door to making new friends. Students are more successful if they have someone to relate to, and if their friend is also in the same club, they have something to bond over. It is important for children to form friendships within their after-school activities because they will want to be more active in the group.\n\nAll throughout school, children are told to plan for their future. They are told to decide which college they are going to go to, and then do everything they possibly can to get there. Many students use extracurricular activities on their college applications, because it can set them apart from other students. If you played football throughout high school, you may be able to get a scholarship. Students who were on academic teams may have a better chance at getting into college. Extracurricular activities are very beneficial for college applications, and could make the difference when it comes to getting in.\n\nTeaching responsibility, forming friendships, and bettering your chances of getting into college are just three of the reasons why I would agree with my principal's decision of requiring each student to participate in an extracurricular activity. With so many options, it wouldn't be hard for everyone to find something that they could enjoy. Students may enjoy and appreciate school more if there was a club they enjoyed there. Extracurricular activities are helpful and important for students.",

    Essay: "Would you like to lose the ability to choose what you do in your daily life? Well, most people would not enjoy losing their given right to decide, and that applies to students as well. Participating in an extracurricular activity has been a choice for the longest time, and it is unjustifiable to force students to engage in such tiring activities. It wouldn't make anyone enjoy school more, it would actually do the opposite, It would tarnish the awful reputation that most schools have and would justify the claim that schools are nothing but a large road block holding kids back. Thats why I disagree with mandatory extracurricular activities, extracurricular activities should always be a choice, and not forcibly be laid upon an individual, it would ruin the palpable relationship between school and students, and it would dramatically increase stress in a school environment.\n\nFirstly, students would have to endure the retched activities that they don't enjoy, and it would tire these kids out to the point which they collapse on bed whenever they would return home, reducing the amount of time we have to work on projects, homework, and other things alike. This, in theory, would increase stress by a staggering amount. Oh, and have I mentioned that most students struggle to wake up and arrive to school at time? Well, having mandatory extracurricular activities would increase the amount of time an individual takes to sleep, making it even harder for us students to arrive on time. Multiple studies have also shown a connection between grades and sleep. This could mean the school getting lower and lower test scores which would be devastating to everyone involved.\n\nSecondly, it would make students dislike our school more than they do already. it would also massively tarnish the awful reputation of schools and promote the rumor that a school is nothing but a massive nuisance to students. Considering the condition and cleanliness of our gym and field it's no wonder why they're both the center of mockery here. It's not hard to guess that extracurricular activities would also contribute to an increase in homework, as P.E already gives out homework and projects which can take up to weeks to complete. In short having mandatory extracurricular activities would tarnish the schools reputation by a wide margin and increase the amount of work both Teachers and Students do, and promote the false narrative that school is just a large road bump.\n\nLastly, I wish to reiterate that extracurricular activities are choices, and not privileges. You may think that extracurricular activities would make students more happy and fit, but no sir, it would instead be another factor contributing to the mockery of our school. The education system should always be seen with respect, but extracurricular activity and other unwanted principles of school is turning it into a source where people poke fun at. If mandatory extracurricular activities are retracted, it would promote individuality and open up more choices in an increasingly unique world. What makes school special isn't friends, classes, or teachers, it's the ability to choose, just like how we chose what classes to take, or choose what to eat on lunch, taking whats special to us is simply outrageous and unethical.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to impose mandatory extracurricular activities is a massive mess up on the schools part, and it is an awful part of school that takes away our right to choose and inflicts a large amount of stress and anxiety upon the student. Extracurricular activities would also be used to mock our school and make kids dislike school more and more. I hope you understand now Mr. Principle. Reversing your decision would be the most plausible and well received decisions amongst the student community. Now, I'd like to ask, would you enjoy having your choices taken away? I believe the correct answer for all of us would be, no.",

    Essay: "The benefits of being part of extracurricular activities, as a student, are tremendous in various ways and can help lead anybody to success. A few examples of these activities are sports, yearbook staff, and Student Council Association. Not only will students benefit academically but also socially. Therefore, participating in extracurricular activities is of great value for students because it allows he/she to find new interests and talents, it is helpful for gaining more social skills, and it helps relieve stress.\n\nExploring new things is an outcome of participating in extracurricular activities. Without trying and experimenting many things, students can not find what what he/she enjoys and what he/she does not enjoy. Knowing the interest and talents of oneself is helpful for creating various goals. This is also important in the long run, short run, and can lead to endless opportunities.\n\nFinding and knowing the interests of oneself is a useful skill when socially interacting with others and creating new relationships. Sharing the same interests as others is an important factor of a friendship. Also, having these good social skills will open up many doors in the future. For example, when interviewing for a job, somebody must be able to communicate well with strangers. To conclude, participating in extracurricular activities can lead to gaining more social skills.\n\nLastly, being part of an extra activity of one's choice helps relieve stress. Many people spend majority of their time on schoolwork. Focusing on other things ,rather than just schoolwork, is vital to preform well on any particular thing. Stress can result in many negative outcomes. Thus, joining an extracurricular activity can help avoid this.\n\nTo summarize, gaining more social skills, relieving stress, and finding new interests are all things he/she can accomplish by being part of an extracurricular activity .\n\nGaining more social skills helps create new relationships. Relieving stress makes it easier to accomplish more and preform better. Finally, participating in extracurricular activities allows students to explore more things and find new interests or talents.

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities, are a great way to find an interest you may have. Some activitie's can be outdoor's, like the hiking club, or the soccer club. These club's help get kids outside, and doing something that they love, with their friend's. Other club's, like the robotic's,video game,or board game club's are great for kid's who prefer to be indoor's. They can help those kids make friend's,become smarter,and most importantly have fun.\n\nI believe, that student's should not participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to. For some kid's who have activities out of school, they might have are hard time getting to their club's. It might put more stress on them, because they would first, go to their after school club. Then, go straight to what they do after school. Finally, they would make it home at a really late hour, then realizing that they did not have any time to do their homework. They might walk into school, exhausted, and probably not as efficient. Their grade's could drop, and possibly the school's average.\n\nMy next reason is, that I believe it might effect the kid's that want to be their. Some kid's who signed up have waited to do this for a while. When you bring in a kid that does not want to be their, he may cause a ruckus. It might make the kid that want's to be their annoyed, and sick of his nonsense. It would start to make the kid that want's to be their might have less fun. With all of that, it could make no kid's want to be their, and everybody wishing they could just go home.\n\nMy final reason is the right of choice. Everybody has the right to do something that they want. In my opinion, you cannot just force someone, to do something that they don't want to do. If they want to join a club at school, and have fun with their friend's,then that is great. If they want to stick with their out of school activities, or no activity that is all good. We cannot force someone to have fun.\n\nI loved all of my club's at my school. I remember, in elementary school doing taek won do with my friend's was awesome. It seemed at my school everybody loved their club's that they were in. I believe, it was because it was our choice. The school did not force us to do a club, and that was the beauty of it. Everyone did what they wanted to do. Being with people with my same interest, helped me make new friend's. It could do that with kid's all over the country.

If these children waste their child hood almost all day at school, They will become more hyper and misbehaved. At one point of the day all of their energy will over flow and just explode. When their energy bursts they are going to be yelled at.\n\nAfter enough of this students won't be excited to go to school and learn. This could also mess up thir sleeping schedule. Students are going to be in school for longer, their going to be wanting to be awake at home for longer. This will cause tardy's to school the next day. Parents will be furious and get angry at the schools for forcing them to stay at school for even longer then they already have to. Parents are going to start calling school free daycare, and teachers arent going to like that.\n\nTeachers will also not like this because they will get less free time. Many teachers have kids and husbands. This would limit their time with their family. Teachers have a life out side of school and the principal has to understand that. These teachers have longer days then the students. They have to make the lessons, quizzes, and tests outside of school. Teachers dont get paid enough to spend their whole days working. If this happens the young teachers will age faster, and their attitudes are going to get worse because of their lack of sleep. In reality this isn't going to benefit anyone.\n\nThe new rule is a waste of time to students and teachers. All kids want is freedom, and putting them in school for extra hours will make school look more like a prison to them. Doing this will not prepare them for the real world. Although this may make students more school smart, they will need to learn how to be street smart to survive the future.",

      essay:
        "Have you ever wondered where your best friendÂ was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.\n \n Signing up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve rackingÂ but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friendÂ was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.\n \n Theres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after schoolÂ activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.\n \n Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friendsÂ of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.\n \n My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.Â Â",

        "Our principle has recently stated to all the students of SCHOOL_NAME that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity. Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.\n \n Musical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.\n \n Musical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as wellÂ as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.\n \n Another great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.\n \n Finally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.\n \n I stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.Â  Â Â  Â",

        "Students should be able to choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not for many reasons. Most students are busy and don't want added pressure on top of school work. While kids may want to do extraculliculars they may do out of school activities that can take up their time, or they might have a family to take care of. Many students also a lot of time for homework, which they won't get the time for in an extracurricular.\n \n A reason students student's may not want to do an extracurricular is because they might have out of school obligations. If a student was babysitting or tutoring someone, they wouldn't have time to do extraculliculars because they'd be busy doing another job. It would be unfair to force someone who has another job to do more work, which is why they should have the choice to do an extracurricular activity.\n \n Furthermore, some students could have a family to take care of when they get home. For example, if a student has a younger sibling that needs to be picked up from the bus stop, the student would have to help with that. If they were forced to do an extracurricular, they wouldn't have time to take care of their sibling.\n \n In addition, quite a few students would need more time to do homework, which an extracurricular would prevent them from doing. While some students can finish their homework quickly and have enough time for another activity, a student who takes a long time shouldn't be rushed into doing something else. If they need more time to do their homework, they shouldn't be dragged into doing an activity.\n \n In conclusion, students have out of school activities, family to take care of, and a lot of homework which can make it hard for them to focus on extracurricular activities on top of it. All in all, there are many reasons a student might not want to do an extracurricular. Because of this, a student should be able to have a choice to do another activity or not.",

        "Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.\n \n Requiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social.Â Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.\n \n These activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.\n \n Another benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students.Â When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.\n \n In conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",

        "Does sitting inside and doing nothing but homework and chores all day sound exciting? Or would you rather have an opportunity to do fun activities with other people, making friends and improving your health along the way? If the latter sounds like the more appealing option, than you should support our principal's decision to make taking an extracurricular program mandatory. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is the perfect choice for our school. That is because it opens up new and unexpected opportunities, provides an outlet to make new friends, and helps improve your physical and mental well being.\n \n You should support the requirement of an extracurricular because it opens up fun and enjoyable activities that you might not have come across if not for this new policy. A very sporty kid might never know that he really enjoys being on the student council unless he tries it, and it is unlikely that he would try it any other way. The same thing works inversely, a book-smart kid could really have a great time playing basketball or football and never know it unless he tries it. The new opportunities can also help your in-school life by helping you learn about certain topics that you are struggling in or by providing service hours to contribute towards your required amount. The activity would also be a place to go every time you would rather not go home or if you just preferred to stay after school with your friends.\n \n The same way that this policy provides an outlet to new activities that you might not have found otherwise, it also paves the way to making you friends that you wouldn't have been friends with in any other situation. If you are a new addition to a certain group and you feel lost with how much more accustomed everyone else is to the group, you could make friends with an elder statesmen type of the group, in a mentor-apprentice kind of way. Many times, you could find people who are in the same situation that you are. If you got to know them and started working together with them, you could both benefit by learning how the group works. Overall, it would just be a fantastic way to gain friends, especially with people who are having a hard time getting to know new people.\n \n Another great way that this program is going to help is how it improves your physical and mental health. School can get very stressful at times, and the amount of homework, studying, test-taking, and other school things on top of the everyday teenage problems that you have can start to feel draining, like a heavy weight being pushed down on you. Extracurricular programsÂ relieve a lot of that stress by being a place where you can slow down a little bit and be more involved in things you actually enjoy being involved in. The physical activities, such as baseball or basketball, are a great place to get some exercise in to improve your physical life. A lot of students this age have it rough in that they might not have a lot of friends or people to talk to, so just a simple activity like the yearbook club could help relieve an immense amount of emotional weight off of that student by actually giving them someone to talk about their problems to.\n \n The intelligent choice by our principal to make at least one extracurricular program mandatory is an incredibly beneficial choice to all who are involved. It is a policy that gives people new chances to find something that they like doing, helps students make friends with people that they likely wouldn't have otherwise, and improves the physical and mental health of those students who need the improvement. If you are for the well-being of students and the developmental growth of the people who are the future of our nation, then you should be for this policy.Â",

        "Do you ever wish that you could have the chance to do a fun activity during or after school? Some schools are making students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can start new friendships, and in could be fun.\n \n Doing extracurricular activities can start new friendships. If you find someone with the same interest as you, then you two may become friends. It can be hard for people to meet new friends, but if you find someone with a similar interest then it could be easier to become friends with them. Secondly you guys could do activities together. If you two were to both to play an instrument, then you could practice together. Doing an extracurricular activity could give you topics to talk about with friends. If your at lunch one day and you run out of things to talk about, your extracurricular activity could be a good topic. If you miss out on an opportunity for an extracurricular activity, then you could be missing out on an amazing friendship\n \n Participating in extracurricular activities could be fun. first off there are field trips. Why wouldn't you want to skip a day of school and hang out with friends on a fun field trip? Also you get to do something you enjoy. It can give you a little extra time doing what you love. Lastly it can open up new opportunities. Things like band and orchestra may have festivals or auditions that you could do. Extracurricular activities can give you lots of chances to have fun, and enjoy school a little more.\n \n However, some people may say that students will lose interest. They say picking the wrong topic could lead to a year of being board. This could make students dislike the class or not want to go to it. Although, most students say that they enjoy their extracurricular activity, and even if its not their favorite class, they don't dread going to it. For example if a student liked science class more than yearbook, that doesn't mean that the student doesn't want to go to school. But if a student really didn't like the class, then they would know in the future not to pick it again. It would at the least give a student direction on if they would want to do that activity again. Even though people say that kids will lose interest in the activity they choose, students will always be able to get something out of it.\n \n Having to do an extracurricular activity could lead to new friendships and a year of fun. Being able to experience a extracurricular activity can be a great way to open yourself up to new things, and try different activities. You'll never know what you missed out on if you don't take an extracurricular activity.Â",

        'Across the nation, nearly 98% of schools have offered extracurricular activities for their students, but less than half of that 98% have mandated participating in one. In many schools worldwide, extracurriculars have been known to both help and hurt students - they can lead to staying up late making up for lost time, or they can lead to winning awards and even scholarships. Overall, I believe that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities... and I think you might just agree.\n \n First of all, mandating that students participate in after schoolÂ activities could improve kids\' work ethic. In fact, a study titled ""Extracurriculars and Students"" by Professor James Wood at UVA proves this. Wood found that 65% of students who participated in extracurriculars said they enjoyed the additional challenges that were presented to them, and actually continued to work harder and challenge themselves not only in their education, but also in the workforce. This means that teens and kids who entered after schoolÂ clubs and sports teams worked harder and were able to learn how to overcome obstacles and challenges. This also goes to show how students that entered extracurricular activities did indeed improve their work ethic. In general, I think you\'l find that this is important because it shows how adolescents were able to benefit from after schoolÂ activities.\n \n Secondly, requiring students to join extracurricular activities could help students get into better colleges. Don\'t believe me? Well, a statement released by Harvard University said that 80% of colleges look for (and accept) students who participated in one or more extracurricular activities. To put it simply, after schoolÂ activities have been known to assist students in getting into better schools. This relates because it shows how kids and teens who entered after schoolÂ activities could manage getting into excellent colleges and create a better future for themselves. This matters due to how it shows that extracurriculars can broaden the horizon for students.\n \n But that\'s not all. It\'s actually been shown that clubs and teams could improve a students\' health. A professional from Johns Hopkins said in an interview, ""...Students who participated in activitiesÂ after schoolÂ were reported to have a better attitude, more motivation in and outside of school, and possessed an overall healthier lifestyle than their peers who did not join any extracurriculars."" In other words, adolescents who joined activitiesÂ after schoolÂ tended to be in better condition than those who decided not to participate in any clubs or join any sports teams. This displays how students have been able to thrive and even better themselves thanks to extracurriculars. Overall, I think you\'ll find this important because it shows how kids and teens can greatly benefit from after schoolÂ activities.\n \n However, some might argue that students should not be mandated to take part in extracurricular activities, and say that teens may already have a ""full plate"" and thus become stressed. A statistic from the Teens and Mental Health Welfare Society revealed that 48% of students who participated in after schoolÂ activities reported an increase in stress levels. To put it differently, close to half of the kids they talked to felt stressed due to their extracurriculars. This also demonstrates how a few students are actually pressured by their after school activities. Ultimately, extracurricular activities may stress students.\n \n While that might be true, there\'s no denying that after school activities can also teach kids to lessen their stress by learning to budget their time. In fact, I personally was able to learn how to budget my time between school, family, friends, and extracurriculars. While I didÂ have a lot on my plate at first, my extracurriculars like sports, newspaper, and a few of my other hobbies enabled me to learn how to equally set aside time to complete all of my tasks in a timely manner, and still have time to relax. To put it in an alternate way, my after school activities were able to teach me an important skill that I\'d be able to use for many years to come. You\'ll see that this shows that, truly, extracurriculars can teach students how to budget their time effectively. Ultimately, my extracurricular activities taught me an important life skill that could benefit me in many area of my life.\n \n In the end, I think that we should mandate participating in extracurriculars, as it could improve kids\' work ethic, assist students in getting into good colleges, and even keep them healthy. Imagine a school with no after school clubs or teams offered to students; kids would be bored, unhappy to go to school with no chance to socialize or get active, and, most importantly, no chance to broaden their horizon and truly reach their full potential.',

        "Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity such as a sport or a club. I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because it helps build friendships, raise your low grades, and allows you to experience new things.\n \n The first reason after school activities are beneficial is that they can build a strong and lasting friendship. I remember when I was in elementary school and my mom signed me up for afterÂ schoolÂ basketball. The first few days and even weeks I hated it. I had no friends there or even someone I had seen before. I was scared and shy. Most of the kids were way older than me and looked huge. Most days I sit on the sideline watching them, wishing I could be that good. Suddenly the tallest kid of them all walks up to me and asked if I would like to join them in a game. I was in shocked and happy at the same time. I told the boy I would love to join. every day after that for three years I played with them after school. Eventually me and that boy became best friends and didnt do anything without each other. We played basketball together, watched movies, played cops and robbers, and had sleepovers. Five years later we are still best friends.\n \n The second reason after school activities are beneficial is because they can help raise your grades and test scores. Studies show that students who participate in homework clubs and study clubs generally have higher test scores. This means the students who have higher grades can get into better colleges, and students in better colleges can get higher paying jobs. From just attending after school homework clubs students have already made a step towards their goals of getting a good high paying job to support their family.\n \n The third reason after school activites are beneficial is because they allow students to experience new things. At my middle school we have so many different clubs and activities that everyone can find something they enjoy. I wish I could experience every single club we have but that is just not possible. Before I joined the cooking club I could only use a microwave and toaster. The amazing teacher taught me how to bake and make really fancy dishes for family gatherings or holidays. Before this class my Mom and Grandma cooked for Christmas. Now that I am able to help it feels wonderful because it is more time that I can use to bond with my family and friends.\n \n In conclusion I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because they are great places to build friendships, improve your grades, and experience new things.

        '""Good morning students, this is your morning announcements. This is your principle speaking. I would like to make an announcement that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity this year. Thank you for listening."" ""That sounds like a great idea. I can do track this year,"" I said. ""I can do drama club this year,"" said the girl that sat behind me. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.\n \n Making friends is something that everyone wants to do during the school year. While playing a sport, you can make good friends, and do the sport you really like. When I did track last year, I made many great friends. The friends you make in school, might have a chance to grow up to still being one of your best friends. Making new friends can help increase your social life and have someone to talk to. Studies show that people that have many friends, tend to live longer, and have a happier life. But people that have don\'t have any friends, shows that they don\'t live as long. Doing clubs can also have a chance to make many friends. By doing drama club, theater club, or a robotics club, new people that you meet might have the same interests as you, and the two can share things they like to do and do as a hobby. This creates bonds with other people and groups. These bonds can eventually create friendships.\n \n Doing sports in something people really like to do as a hobby. They can be physical sports or non-physical sports that they can participate in. People also like to be active in clubs such as the yearbook club, drama club, or even the robotics club. Extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and active, so students can have fun. Competing in sports is something athletes enjoy because of the competition with the other teams, and to see who is the better team. Clubs also compete with other clubs, including the robotics club. They build their machine, and then they compete to see which school has the better machine. Being active in activities would be fun for all students because they involve students being active and having them do fun activities.\n \n By doing many activities may spark someones mind that they want to do what they want in the future. If a student does drama club or theater in school, they mightÂ try out for the activity in high school, or do a play as their career. If a student plays football in middle school, they might try out in high school and get a scholarship to play in college. Then, they can get drafted into the NFL as their career. It\'s a hard task, but anything you put your mind to, you can do it. If the student doe not want to play a sport, be in the yearbook club, or do drama, they can run for student council. This may have the student want to run for student council and win. Running for student council includes many things you would to in other activities, including competition, planning,and confidence. This may have the student be interested in politics. They could even run for an election when they grow up.\n \n In conclusion, I think it would be a great idea for the principal to have all student participate in extracurricular activities. In addition, I was on the track team for two years an I made many friends because of trying out. I also got to learn more about sports and I know many people would want to do these activities for a career. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.

You can find something you didn't know you were good at because of the many options that schools have. Over fifty activities in schools around the world! From basketball,soccer,and football,form even cooking. Schools have something that might suit you. So if you don't like soccer or any sports,there's always cooking or Cosmetics. You can make teams and become popular and active. For sports such as soccer and softball,you can make the teams and get popular making a lotÂ of friends in the process. You can make money by trying out for a sport. Once you get into high school,you can earn credits and even a college application which saves a lot of money.

I think that an extra curricular activity is fun and may or may not get you famous,but on the other hand people just seem to abuse it's power.\n \n In conclusion I think that the principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity just because if how fun it is. Taking an extra curricular activity means that you can make new friends and best friends,do something that you didn't know you were good at till now and become popular and active,and be famous just like other famous people around the globe.

        "Imagine if you had to do an extracurricular activity at school with no say otherwise. Extracurricular activities are meant for a fun, optional, learning experience. Most schools offer activities for student interests. Students like the option of extracurricular activities because they can participate in their interests if they want to but it isn't mandatory like most other things in school. I disagree that students should be forced to do extracurricular activities because students should have the choice of what they want to do, most students are busy with other things outside of school, and students may not be interested in what their school offers.\n \n Students shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because they should have the choice of what they want to do. Schools offer activities so students can participate in things they want do, not have to do. Being forced to participate in things a student doesn't want to do can stress them out. Most things in school are mandatory so students like not feeling the pressure of being forced to do something. Making students participate in extracurricular activities can have benefits too. It would make them go out and do something and help them learn new skills. In the end multiple downsides outweighs a few benefits. While there may be benefits to forcing students to go and do something, in the end they should have their own choice of what they want to do or not do.\n \n Another reason why students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities is because most students are already busy with other things outside of school. Forcing more upon them would stress them out and make them dislike school. Students already dread each night they go home because of all their homework so making them have even more to do will over stressÂ them leading to depression and lack of effort. While it is good to challenge students to help them find their full potential, overworking them can lead to problems with their health and efforts during school. Extracurricular activities are supposed to make learning fun and help students learn new skills, not make them dread every day of school. Overworking students when they are already busy leads to anxiety and stress which is why extracurricular activities shouldn't be mandatory.\n \n The last reason why schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities is because some students may not be interested in what their school offers. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students discover what their interests are, not force them to do things they don't care for. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students know what they might be interested in doing in the future. If a student doesn't have interest in any of their schools options, they shouldn't be forced to do them. Some students may only have interests in things they can't do at their school. While some students might have interests that their school offers, not everyone does making it unfair for everyone to have to do an activity. If schools make students do things they don't want to, they will start questioning if their schools cares about their opinion or interests.\n \n In the end, students should have the choice of whether or not they want to do extracurricular activities since some are busy with other things and others aren't interested in what is offered. Overall, I have proved why I think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. Between being forced to do extracurricular activities and having a choice, having a choice is definitely the right answer. I chose that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they should be able to make their own choices, even if it isn't always the best answer.",

        "I agree because maybe it could lead to new friendships or relate ableÂ things or a thing with a teacher. For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activitiesÂ or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decidedÂ to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do. Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activitiesÂ at school or outside of school it's because they want you to feel like you've like accomplished everything in life and you've decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire. You might even find your furture date and be very distance get to know each other so I am agreeing because it causes friendships doesn't have to be home all day and some thing you might like.",

        "Sometimes, students all they want to do, is be on their phones all day and do nothing,i would recommend that students join an activity they enjoy, and effects them in their future career. In that case, I agree with the principal's decision, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons for my decision are students can become more successful,and they can prepare for what they want to be when they grow up.\n \n My first reason is, students can be more successful, and by that i mean better grades. nowadays kids grades drop really low because they are late to class,skip school,or don't pay attention, young teenagers miss a lot of information given by their teacher by not doing what they are supposed to. Staying after school with teachers can catch them up with their work, and help them achieve better goals.\n \n However,activities can prepare young adults, for what they want to be went they grow up. If the student want's to be a professional player they might as well join a sport and practice new skills. Or if a students want to be a chef like the pionneer woman that sells pans and utensils,they could join a cooking class after school. Or somehow they want to be an actor or actress,stay after for more practices in the Drama club.\n \n Wouldn't you want to see your kids graduating college with a master degree? Yes, every parent wishes that for their kids. In that matter students could join extracurricular activities,do community hours, prepare for what they want to be, and be successful.",

        'Why Extracurricular Activites Should Be Enforced\n \n What are ways that can help create a stronger and better student? The principal of Generic_School, Generic_Name, had an idea that will only help benefit and strengthen the students which is by assigning every student in the school with the responsibility of having to preform and maintain an extracurricular activity.\n \n Allowing and giving the students a place where they can spark new interests and express themselves can have a tremendous boost to their mental health along with their self-esteem because of the environment they placed themselves in, and the fact that they can express themselves. A recent study done in Harvard, said, ""93% of students that participate in extracurricular activities are 86% happier with themselves and others because the students are given a chance to express themselves, and feel safe from expressing themselves"". A reason that proves why its better for students to have a strong and penetrable mindset is that students with stronger mindsets tend to do better in school. According to a professor from Yale, ""Students with a good mental health do better in school because the students worry less and have a more positive mindset"". Both of these studies prove how beneficial it can be to assign the responsibility to every student of having to maintain an extracurricular activity because in the long run the students will be happier both with themselves and others, and have a better education, along with a stronger mindset.\n \n Students having to preform extracurricular activities can create new friendships, and bonds with people. An example of this would be if a student named Generic_Name was really into football and equally talented to the amount of love he has for the sport. Generic_Name tried out for the football team and he made the team and now played first string wide receiver. Throughout Generic_Name\'sÂ football season he created a lot of close friendships with his teammates because of their strong roots of interest when relating to football. Another reason that supports the thesis of extracurricular activities creating friendships is from a study recently done in Northern Virginia, from the University of Marymount. According to a professor named Albert Finkilstein, ""more then two thirds of people with similar interests become friends because of the mutual interests both parties share"". Albert Finkilsteins research proves that the extracurricular activities can sprout new friendships among the student population of Generic_School. However, a very important effect that pieces together why is is so important for friendships to be made is that students with more friends have a stronger education. According to a study done in Callasbases Florida, ""nearly 80% of students that have friends and are able to ask questions, share emotions with, and lastly feel comfortable with have a stronger education because students can rely on their friends for help with homework because students feel more comfortable asking questions to friends when compared to teachers"". Another positive affect of creating friendships is that there will be a better High School experience for the student because of the friendships made and the trust that was formed. Overall, with creating friendships from the extracurricular activities comes a stronger education, more people to rely on, and overall a better high school experience because of the friendships made and the comfortability made from creating those friendships.\n \n Forcing students to have to be able to balance school work along with an extracurricular activity can be very helpful in the idea of making students have to learn how to maintain efficient time management skills along with being more productive. One reason as to why extracurricular activities can be beneficial and help teach how to be productive of time to students would be that the students can\'t risk to have bad grades because the school of Generic_School is a prestigious private school meaning that the school only accepts the students with the best grades and the students that are willing to work the hardest. According to Generic_School, ""90 % of all students in the school have straight A\'s"", and, "" Any student that doesn\'t have all straight A\'s than can only have at the most three B+ and then the rest straight A\'s"". From how strict the school is with their grades it seems that they are very productive and efficientÂ since they only expect 110% all the time. However, it is easy to slip up or possibly fall behind and the best way to keep the productiveness flowing and for the students to do their homework every nightÂ is to never stop being productive which is why having an extracurricular activity is very beneficial because it helps teach all of the students how to maintain productiveness and how to have good time management skills. An example of a student being productive with their time would be to go home and do their homework, and to then think ahead and piece the amount of projects that could be coming up and when to do them and then align the upcoming work with days that they are free to do the work so that the students don\'t overwork themselves and instead get their homework done when it needs to be done and then spacing out the upcoming projects on days that they are free. Overall, having extracurricular activities can help students expand on being more productive, being able to have good time management skills, and space things along with being able to maintain such things.\n \n The strengths and effects that can be created with the idea of students having to maintain and participate in extracurricular activitiesÂ are improving students mental health, students creating friendships with one-another, and lastly, the idea of students having to learn to balance extracurricular school activities with school work along with learning how to create more efficient time management skills and being more productive.Â',

        "All students should have a decision if they want to play a extracurricular sport. One reason is that some students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and doing homework stuff like that. Next, reason is students might not like the sports that are given to play, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not given that much attention to school, because they are so into the sport they are playing. So, i think students should have a choice to play a extracurricular sport.\n \n One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, that they don't have enough time to play a extracurricular activity. Students might have a job to do after school, like working, have to babysit there sister, and get somebody off the bus everyday, etc. Students don't have enough time to do an sport, and have responsibilities to do too. Therefore, Students have responsibilities to do that doesn't require doing an activity that can take time away from doing that.\n \n Next reason is students might not like the activity given to play. Someone might not appreciate or like the activity they have to play, because they don't know how to play or just to lazy to play it with others. Students nowadays like to choice what they want to play not what others want them to play; because they might not like the activity given to them. For example they might have got picked to play soccer, they never played soccer so they may not like to play; because they never played that exact activity. Therefore, they should play what they played or seen get played by them or others.\n \n Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school. They are so focused on that one activity that they forget about what is happening around them. Students give so much attention into something not that much important as school and there grades. There grades are dropping because they skip half of class just to do an activity, they never make it up because so into what happened during that activity time. Therefore, school should come first before any sport and everything else avoiding that school time.\n \n In conclusion, students should have a decision to what they want to do for there after schoolÂ activity. One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and getting younger kids off the bus, etc. Another reason is students might not like that activity given to them, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school, because they are so into that activity. To sum this up no i don't think every student should have to play an activity if they don't like or don't have enough time, or not paying attention in class.",

        'Imagine every single student at your school is associated/participating in a sport, helping the yearbook committee, or even just serving on the student council because it could greatly impact the school by making it more organized and ""healthier"". Well thats exactly what my principle has decided to do. But not only can this change how there doing in school, it can also affect how they are struggling financially with all the fees they have to pay.\n \n Time plays an important role in this because a lot of students wont be able to fit an extra material into there daily schedules because there already jam packedÂ with other things they need to do throughout the day. This is also a little cruel for students because they would have to be occupied with numerous things at once and still remember to do other things. If the principles say that we must do an extracurricular activity, we wont have any time to do our own things. Students dont like to be stressed out and having to do lots of things at once. We already get tons of homework that some of us dont even finish because of the time we have isnt enough. So students might even stop turning in homework on time or even at all. Because focusing on other things has made it harder for them to keep up with school work. And then the student is blamed on for not doing it, but its not really there fault that they dont have enough time at home to finish everything. Students are getting the time taken away that they could use to do something that they enjoy like; spending time with there pets, relaxing, hanging out with friends etc. And that could affect how there school performance is going. Also they time they should be using as homework there turning in there free time because they dont have any other time for themselves.\n \n Money is also a problem in this situation because not everyone is going to have the necessary money needed to pay off the fees, or to get the materials needed for the activity they have chosen to do. But if the school offers to help pay the fees, then it would be a lot easier for those who need help financially. Im not saying they should pay the full price, but that they could help pay some of it, and the family getting helped does too;so that way they are both contributing. If money support isnt an option for them, then they just wont be able to participate and that should be blamed on the school not the family because its not their fault there struggling and cant afford to pay there children activities that the school says they ""must"" do. But whats the school going to do if they dont? suspend them? I think not.\n \n Most students wouldnt even want to participate in an extra curricular activity because they are already stressed out at home and have other things to deal with. Maybe the student is going through a rough time and doesnt want to be pressured into doing something extra thats just going to worsen there problem. So they shouldnt be forced to do something they dont want.\n \n Overall the schools shouldnt be doing this because its just a waste of time, money, and academic time. students already have a handful of things they need to keep up with for example: homework, they usually get it everyday with every class; that is already stressful enough. Religious activities like attending church or going to mutual, babysitting for friends or family, or even just spending time with friends,family and even pets. But with the school making us do other extracurricular activities, we wont have time do to what we enjoy and make us happy.Â',

        "I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.\n \n Participating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.\n \n An extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.\n \n I positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular. They don't even have to take up that much time. There are an amazing amount of opportunities and benefits that come from them that shouldn't be passed. It could just be something to do after school, or it could be what you love to do. An extracurricular is great for everybody.",

Some people are shy and get nervous talking to people. Others are rude and don't like people in general, and people don't want to talk to them. Some people just can't make friends because they're funny looking.

Some students after school participate in clubs or sports like the year book, student council, or football. Now some schools they may require you to participate in an after school activity, and others may not. Personally i am against it because many students work after school, many students have no interest in any, and many students who dont want to be there will be a distraction to those who do want to be there.\n \n First there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. If they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. They may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. If you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.\n \n Secondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. Maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. Now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. If they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.\n \n Lastly it could cause stress. School puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. Have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. Some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. Some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.\n \n In conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. Now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. Its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.",

Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights.\n \n The students should decide what they should do, not the principal because students should get their own opinions. Letting the principal decide the students what to do, make me feel not very good because it make me feel like he is telling me what to do and i dont like that.\n \n Some other people are not good at doing sports or working the year. Some people are different from others. Some students are best other things and some are not. Many students have their own taste on something.\n \n I disagree what is the principal is saying because they cant forcing any the student, the students should decided they own, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity. The students should be able to choose what they ever want.Â  Â",

        "Do you like different activities? This one time I didn't want to participate in an activity. Even though you don't want to participate in the activity, it will still help you. Then other people will remember you in life. I agree with the principal's approach because it can help you later in life, it can get you more involved with great things, and it can possibly make you famous.\n \n Participating in an extracurricular activity can help you later in life. It can help you because people would be there for you. More and more people will know you and help you out with the rest of your life. Basically what I'm saying is the more people know you the more it will help. Now that's how people know how bad you want help later in your life.\n \n Another effect of participating in an extracurricular activity is it will get you more involved with different activities. Just like the second paragraph this is one is great too. When you get more involved its good for you because you meet different people and famous people. Thats how it can help you later in life. When you participate in an extracurricular activity, its almost like the start of a new adventure.\n \n One more thing of participating in an extracurricular activity is that it can possibly make you famous. Now this is the best part of this adventure. How you can be famous from one thing just like that you ask? Well there are people watching you. You could be an National Football League star, a professional Newsreporter, or maybe the next President of the United States.\n \n Now I think people should agree with the principal's new approach because you could be the changer of this world. Even though you think you don't want to, you can still try it and you just might like it. The best part of being famous you are the boss, and you could change the country forever possibly. All you have to do is try an extracurricular activity. Come on try it people try it. You will miss out if you don't get more involved. It's not too late to agree with the principal's approach.Â",

        "What if your principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity? How would you respond to that? Would you go against them or stand with them? My principal made that decision for our school and I am standing with him! Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school.\n \n Extracurricular activities are an extreme benefit and help to the community. Many clubs actually are made to serve and make changes to the community. However, many people believe that students shouldn't be the ones having to do extra work to help out. It isn't all about the changes or the service it also helps them come together as a community and accomplish things as a team. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community.\n \n Benefiting the students is another thing extracurricular activities do. Students learn many skills such as teamwork, leadership, and responsibilityÂ when they take part in these activities. Extracurricular activities teach students many things that they wouldn't learn during school hours or class time. When the students take part in these amazing things, the build an even more amazing reputation for themselves. Many say that students will lose focus and interest in school when they take a part in extracurricular activities. But, in reality extracurricularÂ activities are the reason some students come to school and strive to do their best.\n \n Schools benefit a lot from extracurricularÂ activities. ExtracurricularÂ activities keep schools motivated and running smoothly. Many extracurricularÂ activities require competition this means they keep healthy competition going. Clubs and teams bring the school closer. Students feel as isn't just a place to do pencil paper work when they can actually do these things and them be associated with school. These activities surely are expensive on school. But, the experiences that they bring students are worth more than a million dollars.\n \n Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community. Extracurricular activities are the reason students are great leaders and strive to do their best. These activities help a school build their backbone and the way others see them as a whole. Wouldn't it be amazing if your principal made you take part in these activities!",

        "The principal just announced a new school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate in at least on after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.\n \n First of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.\n \n In this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great.\n \n Going off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere!\n \n In conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people.Â",

      essay:
        "You have so much to do! You have a pile of homework, youth group, errands, and, on top of that, you have to meet with a club that you don't want to be in. If you force someone to do things that they don't want to do, there can be a lot of negative effects. As a result, I don't think that participating in an extracurricular should be required because people who are forced to join something will probably not participate well, could get very stressed and overwhelmed with the extra load, and people who are not already in a club have multiple reasons to not join.\n \n First off, if you aren't able to find an extracurricular that you like, you could be forced to join one. Then, if you're forced to join a club that you do not like, that could hinder the group's progress and work. For example, if someone who doesn't know how to play lacrosse joins the lacrosse team, some people would be angry. Especially if the new person doesn't want to play and doesn't know how. They are most likely diving headfirst into the sport without learning the rules. That means they wouldn't know how to check correctly, wouldn't know defense or attack, and wouldn't know the rules for scoring. On top of that, them not wanting to do lacrosse would ruin the team dynamic. We had a player one year who did not want to play on the defense, so she played the position as bad as she could, making the people who were trying to play well angry, and ruining our teamwork. So, if people don't want to participate in a club or sport, they might ruin it for everyone else, and that wouldn't be beneficial.\n \n Next, having an extracurricular on top of everything that you already have to do, like homework or family, could make you stressed and exhausted. I know for me that having lacrosse practice, Odyssey of the Mind, and homework every single day makes me exhausted. I enjoy playing lacrosse, and I enjoy OM, but when I get home from lacrosse after an hour and a half, and having done OM before that, I have exceeded my limits of activity for the day. All that I want to do is take a shower and go to sleep. If I have to do my homework and spend more time working, I will most likely be very tired the next day. With that, other people might have little siblings that they have to take care of, and being in a club, going home and doing their homework, and after that, taking care of siblings, will give them a lot of stress to do everything fast, making them rush their homework to make sure that their sibling are cared for, or neglecting their siblings to do their homework well. Juggling multiple responsibilities can impact stress levels, productivity, and time management.\n \n Finally, people who are not in a club can have multiple reasons not to be in a club. You could choose not to be in a club because your parents can't pick you up afterwards, you have too much homework every night, you have siblings to take care of, etcetera. People who aren't participating in any extracurriculars just might not want the responisibility of remembering. Everyone has a reason, even if it's that it doesn't sound interesting.\n \n Joining an extracurricular should not be forced onto students. I think that if you force someone to do anything that they do not want to, they will not participate and that will come back around to you in negative ways.",

        "If my principle were to require every student to participate in an extra curricular activity, I would disagree. I choose to disagree because, some students might not have the time, parents or adults at home cant take or pick them up, money problems, students are needed at home and, they should be able to have the choice to participate in an extracurricular activity or not. I feel it is unfair to force all students to participate in an activity.\n \n Many students might not have the time to do an extracurricular activity. They could have a lot of homework they must do or, they could be busy doing other things. Parents might also not have the time to bring their kids to the activities and pick them up as well. Many parents work and they might even work until late. How would they be able to transport their kids to and from their activities? From my expirience, my parents are both really busy. My dad goes to work from early in the morning and doesn't get home until about 7PM. He's busy all day. Therefore, he wouldn't be able to to get my siblings or I from our activities. My mom also helps my dad at work, they're both really busy. She has to take my brother and I to our practices everyday then, pick us up. I myself am a busy person. I have practice 5 times a week and they're back to back. Sometimes I have to wait hours to eat and most nights I don't have enough time to do my homework. I go to sleep late and do it all over again the next day. You can't buy time or make it go by slower to get to and from those activities. It all doesn't fit into some peoples scheduals.\n \n Forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity isn't fair for a lot of reasons. Some students might not be interested in sports. Some might not be interested in being on the school council. Some might not be interested in working on the yearbook. Some just might not be interested in any of the activities that are provided. Everyone has different things they like or enjoy doing. Forcing students to do something they don't like, makes them feel uncomfortable or out of place, it isn't fair. It makes them miserable. Schools focus on including everyone but sometimes they don't include how a student feels.\n \n Money is also an issue. I know for a fact that participating in a sport isn't free. Nothing in this world is ever really free. We never know about a familys money situation but, it's important to keep in mind that some people struggle and that includes even providing food for their family. On top of that housing bills, other bills, insurance, taxes and savings is already a hassle for a family who is struggling. Adding activities that require a payment for an activity that a kid is forced to do is even more unfair and more trouble. It adds too much stress.\n \n In conclusion, forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity could be an inconvienance as well as unfair. Not a lot of good things come out of a situation like this. The negatives cancel out the positive.Â Â Â Â Â",

My principal says that students should attend any type of extracurricular avtivities. Such as art, sports, yearbook, and many more. I agree with my principal with his thought of choice.\n \n Having fun classes can really help student when they start having a ruff time in school. Class is really stressful for me and others when they don't understand something at school. My happiness is soccer, art, and writing. Those 3 things help me so much. So when i'm strugling the only thing I think about is doing something I know that will keep my mind off of it and will start to calm me down. Art is one of the best class anyone can take. I say this because art, is litearlly art. You can do art out of anger, stress, sadness, and even happiness. Litearally out of anything. If your planning on doing a new sport in high school it can build your stress to even it to be better. I would have to wait all the way until i get home to play soccer, but in high school you will have a period so you can do that sport or activity. You should'nt be forced to keep doing your work without a break from being overwhelmed.\n \n The more you practice the better you get. I understand when people say the more you study in school the more you understand. Thats not just for school work. It's also for these fun activities. Say you have never done a sport before, but want to start. You can do that in school and then when you sign up for the sport you want to do you will already be really really good, because all the practice you have got. Also, most people in middle school want to do a sport in high school. If you participate in that specific sport the coaches will see that you are really intrested in doing it. You can even do soemthing you never thought you would do, like Yearbok. Yearbok is a fun activityt and you can do a lot. The more you do it the best you get. That can be you new enjoyable hobby. No one ever knows what you can't do.\n \n Although, students being allowed to do a fun class during learning hours can get them to lose the thought of there work. Students should focus on school work and schol work only. Especially for those who want a good career in the future. You can actually make a lot of money from art. Art is a easy activity you can do for your whole life, and it will also lead you to big things. The most important thing in my opinion is to do something that will get you somewhere ahead of life. Doing that will help you sucseed within your future. Anyting you enjoy doing as an activity can get you somehwere.\n \n Extracurricular activities should be a new thing students at Hayfield should attend, and many more schools.

        "Nearly over 78% of students participate in after school or extracurricular activities in the US as of today.\n \n While it is important for a young adolescent to become involved in some form of an extracurricular, to make something of the such mandatory is unneeded and inconvenientÂ for many. Taking part in a extra activities requires many resources which some people can't afford or simply don't have. For a student to become apart of something, it should be at their own free will and not because someone of higher status makes it not optional. With forcing these students into all of these different subjects and areas it can create issues with money for low income families, time consumption, student transportation, and student's overall mental health and happiness.\n \n With families who struggled with income or have budgetary issues, this new rules could be extremely challenging. For those who are on the free or reduced lunch plan, it's even more likely that they wont be able to place their child into an extracurricular due to costs. Activities such as sports, dance, theater, and clubs cost money, something many don't have much of. Whether it's to simply enroll your child in the sport, to pay for dance shoes, or to buy supplies it always comes down to some sort of price. Even if a family is not struggling with funding, many see it as unnecessaryÂ to spend money on something their child truly doesn't wish to participate in.\n \n It isn't uncommon for students who live in larger families with younger siblings to watch after the younger children. Many students who are apart of extracurricular often don't have this job nor need to be home earlier due to this reason. When students are forced to spend their free time at a practice or rehearsal, this creates conflict within the household dynamic. Without the children there to watch after their younger siblings or to perform everyday chores such as cleaning up after the house or tending to a farm if the student were to live in the more rural areas, it causes the family to have to search for daycare or hire an extra hand which is not only costly but also stressful.\n \n Not only is it time that is an issue, but transportation is also a main concern. Many parents or legal guardians travel and work for several hours, often getting home late. If children are at extracurricular while their parents work, this means there is no one who is available to pick them up or provide transportation to such activity or back home. While carpooling or busing may be an option in specific areas, this does not apply to students who do not have access to said buses or who live in extremely rural areas, further from the school or activity site.\n \n Joining an outside group or involving yourself in a social setting where one participates in a hobby may be healthy and is encouraged, but just because it is pushed for does not mean it should be mandatory. The decision to devote ones time, money, and effort to such a consuming thing should be a personal and willing choice. Forcing a student to become apart of the student counsel or to play a sport may seem like the healthy option and makes them involved in something, but sometimes this can be damaging to a student. If the child is unhappy with what they've been put into, and are forced to participate in this activity several times a week, it's bound to create some form of an issue with the student over time. It can cause depression or irritation, with one being forced into something that doesn't truly bring them joy which may both effect the students personal life and scholastic performance.\n \n Becoming apart of an extracurricular activity should be a free willing, and personal choice that fits for both students and their families. This should revolve around the students wishes and not those of someone who does not know each child's personal situation. Forcing one into something they did not choose for themselves has very few positive effects and is bound to do more harm than good for each individual and their families. Enlisting each and every child into activities outside of school causes too many conflicts with time, money, transportation, and a student's overall well being. Although it's encouraged to participate in an extracurricular, it should not be made mandatory for students.",

        "When going into middle school and high school, most students have the opportunity to pick extra curricular activitiesÂ such as sports, art, student council, and much more. These activitiesÂ give them a chance to incorporate their interested into their schedules. These classes are also often beneficial to the teenage mind while they are trying to grow and explore themselves. However, should extracurricular activities should be required? Without extra curricular activities, it is harder for teens to have the opportunity to be apart of their community. They also help teens branch out, be creative, and make new friends. Extracurricular activities gives students more independence and freedom to structure their own schedules, which can get pretty busy and full of school work! Some teens, however, don't see the benefit of extracurricular activities during middle school or high school and still need a little push to get involved. Students should be required to take an extracurricular activities because, it forces them to be an active citizen who is part of the community, it gives them anÂ opportunityÂ to takeÂ theirÂ mindÂ off of school, and it pushes them to go out of their comfort zone and try something new.\n \n Requiring teens to take an extra curricula activity will help them become more involved in their school and local community, which is an important part of their lives. The average school community is made mostly of the student, so their involvement in the school is vital, even more so then the teachers. Not only does extracurricular activities help in school involvement, but it gets teens a head start to be involved in their local communities too. For example, some high school cheer leadingÂ teams not only cheer at school sports events, but cheer at town or county events. Also, lots of school art classes have their students work displayed at local shows or even just around the school building. In addition to that, lots of musicalÂ groups preform at school concerts and go to state competitions. These are only a few of the options, but almost all extracurricular activities work to get their students involved in the community. By enforcing extracurricular activities you enforce an involved lifestyle at a young age which is a skill teens can carry with them for the rest of their lives.\n \n Not only do extracurricularÂ activities make students lives part of the community, but takes their minds of of their stressful school life. After a long day in school students are often forced to go home and do even more school work. Teens minds are consistently on school, grades, tests, and homework. School can create an unhealthy amount of stress, especial for teens who are still growing up. It is also easy to get sucked into over working and over worrying about grades and a good GPA. Having extracurricular activities normally gives them at least an hour of time to de-stress themselves every day. Not only do they get this time to distress, but also to put their energy into something they love! It is a huge change from sitting in a classroom trying to pay attention all day. Student need this time and this outlet do things that make them happy. Requiring extracurricular activitiesÂ will give all student the chance to de-stress and take their minds off school work, especially when it becomes unhealthily over whelming.\n \n Lastly, requiring teenagers to branch out and try something new threw extracurricular activities can introduce them to new opportunities and teach them a valuable life lesson. Teens often fear trying something new or coming out of their shells. These fear often come from the fear of not being accepted or the fear of failure. Unfortunately,Â while trying to figure out how to fit in, teens can take the wrong path and become a bully or put themselves in danger. Extracurricular activities teaches them how to try new thing in a safe way. Breaking the ice between groups of people can be very hard and is something that most teens fear they will fail at, but it becomes a lot easier when they all share common hobbies. Extracurricular groups are like built in friends, or at least a group of people that have shared interests. Learning how to try newÂ things, even tough it might seem scary is an important lesson that will helps teens for the rest of their lives. In conclusion, extra curricular activities will teach teens how to branch out and try new things, a skill that they will use even in adulthood.\n \n Teaching teens how to become part of their community, take their mind off of school, and try new things, are all benefits to requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities force kids to not only be involvedÂ at school, but locally in their town and city. They also let kids have a built in break from the stress that school brings. Finally, they teach kids the valuable life lesson ofÂ trying new things. Most teens are just trying to figure out who they are before beingÂ thrown into the life of adult hood. For many, however, they don't want to identify as the average teen who sits in a classroom all day. It is important to give students things like extracurricular activities so they can celebrate what makes them unique. Extracurricular activitiesÂ aren't just a club or a group of people, it is an outlet to be yourself.Â",

        '""Ughhhh,"" said Generic_Name, ""I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!"" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. ""Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?"" Generic_Name questioned, ""well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school,"" Generic_Name\'s Mom replied. ""I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, dont you think so Mom?"" Generic_Name said, ""I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there,"" Generic_Name said, ""sure honey, I think thats the best idea ever!"" Generic_Name\'s Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.\n \n First, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at leastÂ one school activity tend to be more self confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self-confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self-confident.\n \n Second, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becomingÂ a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.\n \n Third, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high-school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.\n \n Imagine, you have just made your high-school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. Your a great, wise person that everyone looks up to and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouth-watering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.',

If we have that added on to school a lot of students will be going to sleep in school. Studies show that in the U.S. 45% of students is going to sleep in school. So, why would you add an extra activity\n \n So it can waste more of our energy? So we can go to sleep faster?\n \n I strongly advise everyone not to do any type of sports. You will get sore from pratice,injured,break a bone, tear your A.C.L. or worser. Lke in football you can get seriously injured. Why yall want us to do a type of sport we can ge injured in? Studies show that 58% of students get injured by Participating in sports.\n \n We should just and learn then to do the extracurricular activity.

We can finsh the yearbook in one day so what's the point of makeing it an activity that's just takeing takeing time from our learning. Matter of fact you can just just select five or six people to do yhe yearbook it's no point of makeing it an activity. By the way way why start this early you should wait until June.\n \n Serve as a student council? That's not even an activity that's just for one person so, why should that even be included as an activity? That's not a reason why everybody in the whole school do an extra activity in the school. That's just for that one person. That's not an reason why we should miss out of learning because of an student council.

        "Should the principal be allowed to force decisions on their students? While this may lead to some poor decisions, it would be better in the long run. \"\"Why?\"\" you say, you see 70% of kids don't do social or physical activities of any kind, and suffer as a result. There are also a lot of times where kid's are forced to do something new and then end up liking it. Something they never would have done they liked. Along with that, putting kid's through these programs could also give them valuable life skills. Overall, I do think that the principal, or whoever is managing the school, should be allowed to force these programs upon kids.\n \n My first point I'm going to list is that it get's them doing something. Like I said a lot of kids don't do anything by themselves, and around 2/3 of them have less than three friends. There is a whole outside world waiting for them. It is also noted that these kids more often than not have great talents, which are just waiting to shine. With a stronger school, getting them to go outside, and participate in activities such as clubs, school teams, and the student council would be easy and beneficial, and some of these benefits would be stronger and smarter kids, and more school funding for these programs.\n \n The second reason I think this should be done, is because of practical reasons. The goal of the school is to cram as much as they can into the student before the year's end. They could also set up after school activities straight after school to do this even better, along with this would help students who don't have parents or guardians at home. Whether this would be mandatory or not is one sided, it must be mandatory. Another practical reasons this should be done is that it would allow more time for the teacher and student to interact helping with the normal school day and settling any problems.\n \n One thing other people might say is that it would increase costs, and that the school shouldn't be messing with the student's childhood. Both of those accusations are wrong. Doing these has been shown in several studies to not be very expensive, and is literally just a step up from end of day clubs. The second point isn't true either, the school is a part of the student's childhood, and they should be embracing it. Younger generations haven't learned what and what not to do yet, and the school can help them decide.\n \n In the end, I do think that the principal should be able to force activities like these upon the students, to improve their live skills, and maybe provide a bit of fun. Of course, the United States is a republic, so it all depends on the parent's, but I do think they will agree with what I say, that children shouldn't be sitting in their bed all lazy, but be making important life choices.\n \n Now what do I think you think of this? Even if you are just a student, and not a parent of teacher who already knows all the benefits, it is for your personal future, and it will be better for you. Tell other people about this idea, and eventually it will be national education.",

We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to. We already hate being in school.\n \n The first reason why is. We already have enough to do at school is because, we have to do 5 SOLS, 2 for English, 1 for math, 1 for civics and economics, and 1 for science. We already have to have 4 blocks a day. We just don't need anymore classes.\n \n The second reason is. We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to because, we already spend around 7 hours in school.

        'Generic_Name closes his eyes as the teacher thunders her way towards him. She finally arrivesÂ with a hungry smile and cruel eyes and says,""Generic_Name did you do your homework?"".""No i did not teacher because I had no time due to the outrageous rule that the principal made that made it mandatory that all students participate in one extracurricular activity."" Her eyes gleamed with anticipation as she gave Generic_Name an F and walked off to seek her next victim. The rule that dictates that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity is a mutiny and should be abolished at once because,students can use the extra time for more beneficial uses such as doing their homework or catching up on some sleep,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will notÂ benefit them.\n \n The first reason why the rule that states that you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be nullified is,that students can use the extra time for more productive purposes such as doing homework or catching up on some sleep. When i was younger I used to participate in writing club and when I would come back home I would be drained. I would have no energy to do anything so the majority of the time my assignments went incomplete and turned into zeros. One day the teachers started noticing the lack of turned in assignments and called my parents for a parent teacher conference. the teachers brought me and my parents to a table wearing serious expressions. The teacher said,""Your son has displayed superior thinking skills but the lack of turned in assignments astounds us."" My parents replied by saying,""Our son gets back everyday from writing club extremely tired and does not have the time or energy to do his homework."" they came to a conclusion to cancel writing club for me and then I started turning in my homework on time. 44 percent of homework is not completed due to lack of time. If you say that they can do their homework when they get home after the extracurricularÂ activity I would say that kids are not fully developed adults yet and dont have as much energy or stamina and cannot function after long periods of time.\n \n The second reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be abolished is,that schools do not specialize in what club or sport that they offer and they will not teach it as well as the facilities that specialize in what they are offering. Its not the schools job to provide extra clubs they can offer clubs but they should not be able to force you to join a club. If a child wants to play a sport or endorse an activity, he can go to an outdoor club or facilityÂ that specializes in what the child wants to do. When i was eleven years old,I played on my school soccer team. The coach did not know how to play soccer and I hated it. I never got any better and I almost quit soccer then and there,but I went home one night and told my mom about it. She said,""You should try UCLA Soccer I read about it it\'s very interesting"". I tried it out the very following week it was amazing,I loved it and,I have been playing soccer ever since. If you say that the school clubs can also be good at teaching what they do I would tell you that a school club will never be as good at teaching a sport or activity than an actual facility that specializes at the given sport or activity.\n \n The third and final reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activities must be abolished is,that if you force the kids to choose from a limited set of sports and clubs they might not like any of the activities that you are offering and because of that they will never practice what they are being taught and will never get better at what they are being taught. If a person does not like what they are being taught 98 percent of the people will not practice the subject or sport they do not like. If you dont practice what you are being taught you will never get better at what you are practicing and will never succeed at it. My cousin used to play karate and he hated it he would always pass the tests but he would never practice and as a black belt some of the blue belts that practiced were stronger than him. One day his mom asked him""Why arent you as good as some of the other students""? He replied by saying,""I dont enjoy karate like I used to and as a result,I don\'t practice anymore"".\n \n If you say that people at school can like the subject or sport they are being taught I would say that is the reason extracurricular activities should be offered but not forced.\n \n Generic_Name smiles at the teacher as she comes by ""Do you have your homework she asks""?""Yes ma am.""he replies with a grin. Ever since the rule that made extracurricular activities mandatory got abolished he has had time to finish all of his assignments and still had a little time for relaxation. I disagree with the principal\'s rule that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity because students can use the time for more beneficial purposes,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will notÂ benefit them.',

        "Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so why not satiate all three by participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wideÂ joy by solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!\n \n Firstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved by participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached by all participants makes the friend-finding process much more simple. ExracurricularsÂ alsoÂ provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel they don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel they do.Â Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability by building support systems has never been more important.\n \n Next, parents may find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school may not have to do that anymore, at least for a day or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new foundÂ friends to get home.\n \n Finally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!\n \n In SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.\n \n Extracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires joy in people is always a good option. Starting with extracurricular activities is a great option!",

        "Extracurricular activities are very important in a students life. They develop communication skills, social skills, and among others, your ability to work well with other people. On the other hand, they should not be required for all students to participate in. Although all students could possibly find something they're interested in when it comes to after school activities, such as clubs or sports, not all students are capable of handling the responsibilities that come along with an extracurricular activity. Have you ever come to the conclusion that not every student can even maintain good grades at school? For some children, it's harder to balance school work and their everyday life alone, but if you add an extracurricular activity to their plate of responsibilities, it may be too much for them to handle. For a principal to make extracurricular activities a necessity at school, is not very considerate. As an adult you must realize that not every person, let alone children, can handle the same work load as others can.\n \n Even though research has shown that extracurricular activities can be very beneficial for people, as it pertains to their physical, and mental well-being, it can also be damaging if too much work is placed upon one person alone. Stress is a very common factor in a child's life, and the majority of it is from life at home, and the excessive amount of work received at school. But in comparison, some kids can handle the load, and like the responsibility given to them. Not all children are like that though, and that is what the principal fails to realize. Although the principal may not have come to light about the amount of stress that could potentially be put on the students, the gesture to make the activities a necessity was most likely at their best interest at heart.\n \n For the kids that work well under pressure, or have the capability to handle the challenges they face, the change in the schools priorities for the students probably won't affect them as much. Although only one extracurricular activity would be required, not all students could be able to wisely manage their time to fit the activity in their schedule. Also, maybe not all students would be able to find something they enjoy with the options given at their school. If someone were to make it a priority for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would be extremely recommended for the person to make the activity choices an exceptionally wide variety, so that it is more likely for students to find the things they enjoy to do. With the exception of making sure that there would be an activity to match each students interest, the idea would not be too bad. But in the same breath, that'd require some type of survey or application of some type, that every student must take in order to find out their interests, so that way making the activities wont be as difficult. Although keep in mind, that not every student may want to participate regardless of whether or not there is an activity they might enjoy.\n \n There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouseÂ some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, \"\"average\"\" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand. But the idea as a whole would potentially cause a lot of stress to the principal, considering that not every child will have the same perspective on the idea, nor will their parents.\n \n Yes, the motion being taken will have several benefits, and several stressful altercations, but at the end of the day everyone is different, and not everyone is going to have the same opinion when it comes to this situation. Even though the principal is only asking each student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it still may be too much to ask of some kids, considering their life outside of school, and what they find important in their lives as far as activities go. But maybe enforcing this act could open not only the students' eyes, but the parents as well, that trying new things isn't always such a bad idea, sometimes we just need a little push to get us started. But despite all the possible benefits of the idea, it still probably shouldn't necessarily be a requirement for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know how much stress someone deals with just by handling their personal life, one activity may not seem like much to you, but for some people one activity could be a handful. Forcing the students to participate in activities that they may not like, could possibly lead to a decrease in social skills, instead of an increase. Â Â Â Â",

        "Every school contains extracurricular activities, from sports to clubs to the student council. These after school activities were created to entertain those students who wanted to learn or have fun with others while in a safe and comfortable environment. Although most schools don't force participation, it would be extremely beneficial if they did as extracurricular activities teach how to cooperate with others, allow students to explore things out of their comfort zone and meet new people and shows the crucial importance of time management.\n \n Learning teamwork and cooperation with your peers is an important thing to learn all throughout middle and high school. Being on a sports team or in a competitive club can show students how to work with each other and communicate accordingly. For instance, when on a sports team like volleyball, teamwork is essential. Each member plays an important role but that role cannot be correctly executed unless the other members are assisting. The hitter depends on the setter to give a sturdyÂ and high set in order to spike the ball and score a point, and the setter relies on the defensive line to give a high and straight pass in order to provide a good set. Communication and cooperation with one another is vital and can overall teach the players many lessons and prepare them for the future.\n \n Furthermore, extracurricular activities can also allow students to get out of their comfort zone to learn new things and meet new people. Schools contain numerous different clubs, one for each different crowd a student might fall into. There might be a club for music, books, movies, the environment, writing, or science and math, etc. Making sure students must participate in one of these clubs or activities can give them the push they need to realize a hobby they might not have known they had or meet a new friend they would have never talked to outside of the club. When I was new to my school, I didn't know anyone to well but once I joined cooking club, I learned many new things while participating and met brand new students too.\n \n Although some might argue that they might not have time for this after schoolÂ activity because of homework or chores, this decision made by the school can give students the chance to work on their time management. Time management is one skill that is very hard to achieve but is used almost all throughout your life. Managing school work, with the extracurricular activity, and whatever else they might have at home can allow students to work on this skill and apply it to real life.\n \n The decision stating that all students must participate in extracurricular activities can overall help them when it comes to their future. Giving these students the opportunity to socialize with peers and enjoy themselves can benefit them in too many ways to count, educating them and further preparing them for what's to come after high school and even after college as well. The countless different clubs and teams can allows them to learn to cooperate with others, learn and meet new people and practice their time management skills.Â  Â Â Â Â",

        "Our principle has decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity. Students can serve as student council, work on the yearbook, or even play a sport. I think this is a good idea or way for kids to express themselves. Here are some reasons why I agree with being apart of the activities.\n \n One thing you can do is work on the yearbook. You can also open up and help motivate others. Participating in something helps with many skills such as, communication and working with others. The yearbook could even have anonymous writers, if you want to say something and don't want everyone knowing who said it. Also taking photos of other activities around the school would even be great.\n \n Another extracurricular activity you could do is serving as student council. If you want to see changes in somethings you can step up and work as a council to make a difference. You could also get groups to hang up motivational quotes around the school. Sometimes, even having funds to raise money for the school would be a helpful idea.\n \n You can also play sports to participate in an activity. Playing sports gives you the time for you make new friends, do what you love, and even hang with your bestie. Finding a sport you like can be hard but giving it your all is the best you can do. You can even get scholarships to colleges. And being on a team is your best suport group, they are always there when you need them.\n \n In conclusion, I agree we should be in extracurricular activities. It gives us the opportunity to express our self and have fun doing it. They can also help try and change things to make a difference. The activities also have benefits for us and for school. All of these are reasons why we should participate in extracurricular activities. Â Â Â",

        "Being a teenager can be one of the best times of your life. As a teenager, I myself have participated in many sports activities and extracurricular activities in my free time. Although I am lucky enough to have experienced being in a club and on a sports team, other students may not have that opportunity.\n \n I believe that schools should require extracurricular activities, one of the reasons being kids social skills. Being put into different clubs or sports teams can help teens make new friends and provide a larger circle of students they can interact with on a daily basis. Being in those activities can provide new experiences those kids never thought to try. This can spark new interests and lead to students doing bigger and better things in their lives, and also help them with choosing a career path.\n \n This generation of teenagers has become addicted to technology and social media. Kids ranging from high school all the way down to preschool use technology on a daily basis. If schools require students to participate in an extracurricular activity, It will pull students away from social media and lead to a more productive way in them spending their time. Too much screen time can take a toll on young people's mental health and I believe that in having required activities, kids of all ages can focus on sports rather than their social media status.\n \n If school were to make extracurricular activities required, they would probably have to provide them for free. Schools can't force the parents to pay for extra activities, nor can some parents afford to pay for those activities. If the school covered the cost of everything the school would get more respect, because it would be showing they didn't just care about grades and they care about your mental health as well. If extracurricular were required it would be good for the school to get to fill up their clubs. For example, they could have more students in the yearbook club, which would improve the quality of the work they put into the yearbook.\n \n In the end I believe that having required extracurricular activities would reallyÂ make the school environment a happy and healthier place for students, teachers, and parents.Â",

        "Our principal has decided that every student must be at least one extracurricular activity. In my opinion ,I strongly disagree with the principals decision and I think students should have the option and freedom to choose whether they want to participate in school activities or not. So today I'm here to explain why this is a bad idea and hope you will agee with me as well.\n \n First of all,most students after school are busy, at least I know I am. When I'm done with school and go home I immediately get ready to go to the gym with my mom, I go to the gym at least 2 hours ,after that I go do my homework ,then prepare for my piano lessons at the community center ,and now adding an activity I'm forced to do my schedule gets pretty tight . Thats also a main reason why students dont go to school activities, they simply don't have enough time. But after the principals decision , students have to re-organize their schedules making them have less time to do the things they really want to do.\n \n Secondly , what if students don't like the activity they are forced to do. Yes, I know they are plenty of choices to choose from , but theres a chance students won't like any of them. It will make them feel pressured, stressful, and notÂ joyful about going there. The student may also rebel , leading to them acting bad around the students and making the activity simply unpleasant.\n \n Lastly , this school activities makes it feel like an extra hour of school. We already have enough homework and stress coming at us, so why should we get more? I get that the school is trying to make us be productive and help our school in a fun way with our friends , but whats the fun if we are getting forced to do them, also when students are getting forced to do an school activity it makes students feel like they have to do an extra class that doesn't even help our grades , nor does it count as a grade.\n \n In conclusion, this are some of the reasons I disagree with the principals decisions. I hope this could change your and the principals mind and take in considerate on students opinions as well.\n \n Students should choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and not be forced to.

        "Seven hours per day for five days a week and some students have activities to do after school, along with that students have mountain high piles of homework nightly. Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.\n \n Seven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule. Other students may be struggling with an aspect of school and they go to tutoring for that reason. Adding an extracurricular could interfere with the help they need to succeed.\n \n Starting from age seven students are asked to do homework. When students are seven and in 1st grade they may not have a large amount of homework; however, when students are in high school the quantity will only grow. While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.\n \n Plenty of studies have shown that this past generation of students have the the largest amount of stress scientist have seen in years. Whether that stress comes from bullying, home life, school work, mental health, or high expectations, stress is unsettling high in students of all ages. Middle school student worry about the transition to high school, and high schoolÂ studentsÂ worry about their transition to college. All students worry, even if those worries are irrational, they are still stressed. That is why adding an extracurricular could be too much to ask of students.\n \n Overall, extracurricular activitiesÂ being mandatory sounds wonderful and has many pros as well, but when people look closer they realize that it would end up as a train wreck. ExtracurricularÂ activities should stay optional for those students who have the time and the energy to do their absolute best.",

        "How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all of the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.\n \n In the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an extremely big interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyways, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.\n \n With the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many different opportunitiesÂ that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremelyÂ helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievementÂ for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside of the school as well.\n \n In the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all of the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activitiesÂ that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.\n \n In conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activitiesÂ such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activitites may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",

I think that allowing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, can help a student grow as a person.\n \n I think participating in activities after school is a great idea for all students.

After school activities don't only have to be sports though, there's a variety of options, like music, strategy activities, or art. These allow you to either do more of what you love, or maybe find something new. Also, it could allow them to make new friendships with others. By participating in something like this, can give the student an idea on what they might want to do for a living as an adult. As a student you might not know what to do for a living, but extracurricular activities can allow a student to find a hobby and give them a gist of what they might want to study later on. Finally, these after school activities allow students to practice skills that will help them throughout their life, like strategy, athleticism, and socialization.\n \n Overall, I think that having a rule that makes all students participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea because it keeps students active and participating in something, it allows you to socialize with ones you don't know and ones you do, it also gives you more options for a hobby, maybe you could find something that you are interested in to study later in life, it can give you a chance to find something new that you didn't know you liked before, and finally, it practices important skills that will help you throughout your entire life.

        "Has your school ever made you join extracurricular activities? If not that's totally okay! My school wants students to really get their hands on learning and exploring new things. Personally I think that's a great idea, because students are not only helping their selvesÂ stay busy but helping out their school. Because sometimes our school needs a little pick me up I think in some spots it could use a little makeover and that's okay. Some extracurricular activities you could do are, joining a sport, helping out with yearbooks and redecorate things, or you could even paint or rebuild some things too!\n \n Joining a sport can take time away from doing homework or other things, but thats what being a student athlete is about! At some points it can be really rough and stressful but really it's preparing you for the stressful things in the future. You may not think joining a sport could help you or your school but in certain situations it really can. Some schools have put tons of money into sports like buying new equipment etc. So why not continue on of what people in the past have put money into. Joining sports can be a big deal but no matter what just think about how much you are helping out.\n \n Another thing you could do is help out with yearbooks. Sometimes it can be really stressful for teachers, so why not lend another helping hand and see where it takes you. I mean you never know, they may really like the way you helped out and may ask you to do other things! You never know what the future holds. Not only can you help out with yearbooks, you could also help outÂ by redecorating some things in your school. Just throw your opinion right in there! It could also turn into something you really enjoy and you could continue on with that. Then all you have left to do is say thank you to your principal.\n \n If you enjoy painting or building and you want to help out, let someone know and your school can definitely help find something you can do to help. One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking.\n \n In so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be.

        "I disagree with the decisionÂ that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.\n \n Here are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.\n \n However there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricularÂ activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.\n \n I think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.\n \n In conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.",

        "I agree with the principals decision that all students should participate in atleastÂ one extracurricular activity, it helps students learn new things, make new friends, and have a break from the daily stresses of school. In todaysÂ tough and rigorous education system, students of all ages come home stressed, worried, tired, and upset. The goal is not just to learn anymore but to succeed and ace every single exam. I believe that if everyone had a relaxing and enjoyable activity with no grades or stress, school would become a much more enjoyable place for students, and become a healthier environment for students to successfully thrive in.\n \n This decision will help in four aspects of the students health; academically, physically, socially, and mentally. Academically, like mentioned in the previous paragraph, is greatly improved. Students need a break from the constant testing and late night studying and hours of homework. Personally I know many, many students who are up late at night and up early in the morning, cramming for their many school projects. An activity for them once a week would greatly reduce their sky high stress levels and lead to a better education. For example, I personally know that when I'm extremely confused or worried with my school work, all it takes is ten minutes outside and I feel a lot more calmed down and ready to focus and tackle my homework. I strongly believe that adding this program will rise so many students grades up by a lot.\n \n The next aspect is how this is physically beneficial. Every day students are cooped up in their classrooms, in their uncomfortable chairs, straining their eyes. Once middle school begins you can say goodbye to recess, and when high school starts you begin ninety minute classes. The sitting around for hours on end just gets worse and worse as the workload increases. Those who choose to play sports can make sure to get in their healthy amount of excersize and stay fit and active. Those who do an art class or take pictures for the yearbook are still up, moving and stretching, this is crucial to a growing students health after sitting for seven hours. Students deserve the opportunity to get up and move around because many are sore and tight after sitting for so long. It may not be easy to realize but just giving them that hour of movement after school is so, so beneficial to their health.\n \n The last two aspects are mentally and socially. Mentally has been touched on already, the brain needs a new activity, a break from the constant learning, to explore new paths and try new things. Expand the boundaries of you mind in ways you don't in school. However another aspect of this is emotion. Happier, more social students can usually perform better because they have things to look forward to after school that keeps them positive throughout the day. Some students who are having trouble making friends, or are new to the area can now find a whole group of people to spend time with, and better yet all these people have the same interests as them. This can really benefit some lonely students. It can really make the difference for their grades too, when they become a lot more outgoing. I remember one year, a new girl moved to our school and was rather lonely, she joined the musical, got the lead, and by the end of the year had lots of supportive friends and fellow theatre enthusiasts cheering her on. It was great to see how being a part of something really helps you expand your friend groups and meet people you would have never spoken to if not for the activity. It goes to show how positivity and a better outlook help keep up your energy to really engage with your classes and teachers.\n \n In conclusion, it is crucial for a students proper development and overall educational experience that they are given a break from the demanding tasks of school to enjoy themselves. To give themselves some time to relax, and simply do what they enjoy while meeting new people, learning new things, becoming healthier, becoming happier, and more prepared to conquer the next day of school. I truly believe this decision will greatly benefit the overall health and well-being of all students.",

Although you are a bit surprised by this sudden announcement, you walk towards the Lecture Hall at a leisurely pace (as if you were anticipating something like this to happen). Once you're there, you sit in a chair and wait for all the other students to come rushing in like a stampede of wildebeests. After everything settles down, the principal picks up a mic from a lectern on the stage and starts a speech. In this speech, he talks about how the after schoolÂ clubs are experiencing a steep decline in the number of students that attend them. He presents the crowd with a solution to this problem, a solution that is greeted with some harsh criticism from the majority of the student body. He says that, in order to keep the after schoolÂ program alive, all students will be forced to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, and that all students who chose to not follow this new rule will be expelled. Bewildered by this, you yell out in protest of this new policy, but to no avail. For the principal has already left the stage, and now you have to be a part of one of those worthless, unnecessary, and boring after schoolÂ clubs. As you can see, it is detrimental, to both the students and the school as a whole,Â to force all of the students in a school into participation in an after schoolÂ activity. Due to a plethora of factors along with the one I just described, I wholeheartedly disagree with my principal on forcing every student in the school to attend an after schoolÂ club. If you don't believe me already(in regards with this issue at my school), then hopefully the following paragraphs will succeed in persuading you.\n \n First of all, making it mandatory for all students in a school to attend at leastÂ one club takes away some of their freedom with how they experience their lives. By this, I mean that, by forcing students to go to an after schoolÂ club, you are limiting their options for what they can do after school is over. This is due to the simple fact that, once the student chooses their club(s), the time that that club occupies can't really be used for anything else and takes up a big chunk of the student's schedule. To give context, allow me to give you an example. Lets say that Generic_Name, a seventh grader, decided to take\n \n Quiz Bowl as his extracurricular activity. Immediately all regular activities from 2:30- 5:30 are canceled. In addition to this, he now has to go to some weekend meetings, resulting in him not have time to hang out with his friends anymore, study for school, do all of his homework, or go to the gym. Instead, he now has to guess answers to random questions about the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and wait till about 6:00 PM to get picked up by his bus, and then dropped off at home at almost 7:00 PM, completely exhausted and burned out. As, you can hopefully see, having to do even just one after school activity can take a lot time out of a students life, and in extension a lot of freedom with their life.\n \n Second of all, with this new policy, transportation can become an incredibly detrimental issue for students that suddenly have to take at leastÂ one extracurricular activity. This is because there will always be some students in a school who can't take the bus and have parents that work too far away to be able to pick them up, making it nearly impossible for those students to get home safely, or on time. In addition to this, transportation can be a huge issue in the fact that, with\n \n ALL\n \n students having to take an after schoolÂ activity, on any given day, buses could have to leave behind some students because of a shortage of seats, leaving those who were left behind with no options to get back home. For example, let's say that all the students decide to participate in an extracurricular activity on the same day. With all of those students, it would be near impossible for them all to get a bus rideÂ home. And because of all the parents that have to work during the time that those students would get picked up, the school would be left with a large crowd of students that have no way of getting home on time.\n \n Finally, this policy will probably create a harmful school environment. By this, I mean that it would result in a multitude of considerably hard-to-deal-with problems. Such problems would be: an unmotivated student body, protesting from parents, and an unproductive student body. The lower school morale may stem from anger in students at the principal, and teachers that are exhausted from being overworked due to the fact that most of them will have to host at leastÂ one after schoolÂ club; the parents might complain due to the fact that they won't be able to interact with their children as much, and because they might not like the discontent in their children; and unproductivity would be caused by students burning out from the extra time that they have to spend in school. In addition to all of these problems, students might also try to not participate in extracurricular activitiesÂ resulting in extreme punishments(i. e expulsion).\n \n To wrap it all up, there are a lot of reasons as to why my principal's new policy on extracurricularÂ activities isn't very great. It limits a students freedom, it can't really function due to the lack of transportation that is needed for all of the students, and it creates a bad school environment. For these reasons, I think that the principal shouldn't have made this policy.",

        "I agree because kids should be more physical and should get more excuise in, and the main reason i argee for the principal to make all the kids participate is because so they have some else to do in school other than work and sitting down all day . I think it will help kids get the understanding about sport and working on something, when they get older so what they meant to do and help people. my decision is that the principal should do that more because it will help kids be more better at thing like that so if they ever wanna play sport or anything they know that you have to participate in everything we do.\n \n Activity are fun thing thing to do with people and at school cause it enoyable and fun to do, i really think the principal should do that at every school and the principal is right all kids can participate in sport or work is because it keep kids busy and it have kids doing some extra instead of all the kids sitting in the house or just doing nothing and i think it the right think to do is becuase they can get to express more thing in the world and kids can see more other just not doing nun but being in the house sleep and it will make kids understand life more. I hope that csn get kids in a better place when they grow up and they wanna do stuff on there wn wy amd i think it be nick to do some with them kids as a young as to do do physical sport or work somewhere but it be better to start young and contiune when they get older and stuff,\n \n But the principal is help alot of kids to do think they wanna start trying to do when they get older and I feel like yes that be an great thing to do at a certain age and kids get be participateing in alot of stuff now days . I think it get better and better if kids do it and get use to it because alot of kids are not gonna wanna do nothig because they just wanna stay in the house and get on there phone and not gonna wanna do anything is it would be alot nicer if the principal help out the parent and tell the kids they can aleast particpate in a physical sort or work or do anything they would like to do but they gonna have to participate in somethin but not nothing and i think it be good. I would like to see kids do better in life and do better than what there parent was doing at a young age it would be a thing and something they could do and they can get there own car house and all that and if tha kids like that they prolly can go to college and go to school for that activity and prolly can be a teacher or a manger for whatever they like when they was doing as kids. And it kinda help me out cause it like i like to do physicla thing and like to help people work or anything they need help doing and it like i would like to do it and i seem like an awesome thing to do. And i feel like more thing should enter this world so kids can eneter more thing to do and get into more thing as like an 'Jobs , daycares , and help the community out i think that would be a great think to do the most impoortan thing is how i feel about it or what my decision is about the principal had decided for th kids to participate in school or outdoor activity i think yes the principal should because the kids will prolly learn more from it then just do anything and like in a school activity they could be in a yearbook club , track team ,cheerleader , or any type of sport they are happy or anything to do.\n \n girl or boys can do anything wanna do any sport or more and i think they should wanna do sport cause it got stuff they like and like to do and it keep alot of kids busy to do and i would like to do that to cause i like to work and do sport so for me for myself i would be helpful thing to do . Like everyday kids should do some to help them be better it can be anything i could be running , walking help you family do stuff for the house go shopping do some other than sport and wanna play all day like the game or wanna fight and bully people i think it time just to help the community out and treat everybody as a family because it not alot of people and now days people wanna play sprt get a good and nice job and wanna do alot and i would like to do tracka and be a dancer cause that what i wanna do and my job i would like to do is be a lawyer and something that can help school and everything else , and if the principal would do that i would be a smart great thing to do in that school cause it teaching kids a lesson to do better in life and help kids out , that be a great idea to do . and if i was the princpal i would do the same thing to .",

Making friends can be really hard for some people while for others it can be the easiest thing to do. Joining a club can help with making a friend because the people in the club have the same interests as you.

        "Can a activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.\n \n If more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just haveÂ a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.\n \n Doing any activity outside school also work makes people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind theirÂ goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discoverÂ and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outsideÂ the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physicallyÂ and it makes he or she have a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence it's family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influence other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the you or them have changed so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.\n \n Like alwaysÂ everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most commonÂ problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.Â Â",

        "It's the last play of the State Championship you have the ball at midfield your going as fast as you can go but you know your not fast enough to out maneuver the defender insight but, you sidestep and the defender goes flying past and you walk into the end zoneÂ untouched to win the game. You look up into the stands and you see your entire town chanting your name then, you look back down to the sideline and you see your team, your brothers coming towards you and they lift you up on their shoulders and in that moment you feel like your the king of the world. This is what goes through your head as you hear your principal inform the whole school that everyone has to participate in a extracurricular activity. IÂ agree that everyone should have to participate in a activity because there are so many good things that can come from them. Here are some reasons I suggestÂ that it is vital for someone to participateÂ in a extracurricular activity.\n \n Leadership is one of the most used traits people use it is vary important in your everyday life and in general it's a good character trait to have. First things first you need leadership skills in school let's say your put into a group with some people for a group project. Subsequently,Â no one is motivated to do any work so you take the reins and you jump right in and you start assigning people objectives to meet. With your leadership skills your group gets an A+ for the project all because you took charge. Another reason leadership is important is in sports if you play a position like me goalie, you always have to be controlling the defense or say your the quarterback of the football team you have to be able to communicate with the team and tell them the plays and control the offense. Most important of them all is when your an adult and you have to mange a small group of workers, you assign a worker project to complete by next week. That worker doesn't turn the project in on time and your boss gets mad at you because you were supposed to be managing it and making sure it is done on time.\n \n Having friends in Middle School and High School are important for every kid, teen, and even adults. New kids struggle every day tryingÂ to make friends with others and people have already been friends for 3 year now. A great way for people to make friends with people is through extracurricular activities. Because, the new person and the people in the club or sport share the same interests they have a way to talk to each other. When I first moved to Generic_School I had no clue who any of these people were but, when football season came around and I signed up my team became my second family I knew them like brothers and we stayed together for years.\n \n Some parents won't be happy with the change to their kids schedule but, that is expected when you are making kids do stuff that is new to them. But, when you look at major cities like New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan extracurricular actives are changing their cities for the better. It's keeping the kids off the streets and they are less likely to have been roped into gang related activities. Even kids mortality rate has dropped rapidly since cities have implementedÂ rules that make kids join sports teams or clubs. That shows that making kids do extracurricular activates has helped kids in bad areas stay safe and have a higher chance of making something of their lives.\n \n In this passage I have presented you with some reasons I agree that is vital for schools to implement the rule that all students have to participate in extracurricular activities. This rule will forever change schools in the up and coming years for the better. I suggestÂ that all schools should have this rule implemented for safety and to help their kids build social skills, leadership skills for them to use in their futures. This rule would show kids competitive environments because that's what it is like in the real world.Â  Â Â Â Â",

        "Extracurricular activities, which are activities you can participate in and enjoy the things you would want to do after school such as sports, writing, and any after school activities your school can offer for the students. You're able to choose when and which after school activities you want to go too, but should every student be obligated to participate in extracurricular activities. Why students shouldn't be obligated to take part of an extracurricular activity. After school activities are something you should enjoy and not something to be forced to do and here's why. Some students might have a lot of stuff going on while they aren't at school. Students might also not like participating in after school activities due to no interest in the activities. Possibly students could see extracurricular activities as more stressful than fun.\n \n A students' time after school could be very valuable and partaking in after school activities could always be very time consuming. Sure after school activities could be an hour or two but what if a student has other important things to do out of school. A student could be participating into other activities like sports and might not have time to do homework or study and on top of that being obligated to stay after school. A student might also have pets or siblings to take care of, which would be more important than an after school activity. An obligated extracurricular activity would just be time consuming and might not fit into a students' schedule. The school should understand that students also need time at home because seven hours of learning in school is as already as hard as it is, and then having to go to an after school activity wouldÂ just makeÂ the situation even worse.\n \n There could also be no after school activities a student might have interest in. Some students might have interests that the after school activities doesn't offer them. Even if it's just working on the school year book, an after school activity must be something a student should enjoy after school, not just being forced to do extra work. Just like anything you would want to do, you would participate and join it because you wanted to, and not because of obligation or force too. Just forcing a student to stay after school for something they don't want to do would just make the student dislike school even more. Students should enjoy doing what they want after school which might not even be an extracurricular activity.\n \n Stress would also partake in students having to be obligated to stay after school for extracurricular activities. After a long day at school students would just want to head home and relax from school. Worrying about having to stay after would just cause the student to be more stressed. What if a student didn't have a ride to get back home from after school activities or they were scared of being at school longer, then what would they do in that situation? In case these situations happen what should the solution be? Well since these issues could happen from obligation of partaking in an extracurricular activity, then the only solution should be that after school activities should not be obligated and only stay optional for the better.\n \n Why students shouldn't be forced to participate after school activities. There are many reasons why a student shouldn't be obligated to participate in after school activities and why it should stay optional. Staying after school could stress a student out due to obligation of staying at school for an hour or two more. A student can have other things they do outside of school that after school activitiesÂ can take time away from it. A student might even dislike the activities at the school and would not enjoy their time of staying after school which is the opposite of what after school activities are about. Staying after school is something that'sÂ optional and something you can enjoy doing. All concluded which is the reason why school activities shouldn't be a must.",

        'A few weeks ago, a priest said to me, ""Go the second mile."" That sentence really hit me. I asked myself if I was giving back to the world as much as the world gave me. I\'m sure you know that going the second mile means don\'t do the minimum, go above and beyond. I thought adding this short story would be important because sometimes kids just wanna do the minimum of going to school and then going home. I think that every kid should do at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you succeed with your academic life, do exercise, and have fun.\n \n First, I think that extracurricular activities can help you succeed with your academic life. For example, you can go to a math club if that is what you need help with. This demonstrates that doing extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject. For instance, you can get help from your teacher or coach on a subject that they might know more than you about. This shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to get more help on subjects you might need extra help with. Also, going to an extra class or activity can help you minimize your laziness by having not just to go there, but to complete the work you are given there too. My examples are all evidence of why extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject.\n \n Second, extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise. For example, you can join a basketball team or soccer team. Joining any sports team would help you do exercise by playing with your teammates and practicing. For instance, you can join a math club, memory club, or any other type of academic club that can help you think and answer questions. This demonstrates that joining and academic club can help you exercise your brain by thinking and answering questions. Another way extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise is by doing community service for your teachers. Doing community service like cleaning tables or organizing the library is a way to do exercise because you are constantly moving your arms and legs. In this paragraph I showed you how extracurricular activities can help you work your muscles and exercise your brain.\n \n Finally, extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun. For example, you can hang out with your friends. Hanging out with your friends and doing an activity together can not only strengthen your friendship but also can be an excellent way to have fun. For instance, going to a basketball club or a club you really like can be an amazing way to have fun. This is because you get to do an activity that you love not just by your self, but with other people that love it too. Another piece of evidence that shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun is by meeting new people and making friends. Meeting new people and making friends is always fun if you let it be, so it demonstrates that extracurricular activities are a really good way to have fun. Every piece of evidence I wrote here are excellent examples of why extracurricular activities can bring you joy and happiness.\n \n In conclusion, I think that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you do better on a subject, help you work your muscles and brain, and bring you joy and happiness. Go try an extracurricular activity with your friends. In case you don\'t like the activities in your school, ask to make a new one. They are always worth the trouble. A very wise religious leader once told me, ""Go the second mile."" I found those words to be the greatest I have ever been told.',

        "Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.\n \n As we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This mayÂ also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.\n \n Our parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whetherÂ it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lotÂ ofÂ money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.\n \n When it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.\n \n Extracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and canÂ take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.",

The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree, for the students may be shy, busy, or have money problems at home.\n \n To begin with, students could be shy. Being shy and put on the spot in front of a group could build anxietyÂ or stress. If they work better alone, being apart of any extracurricular activity means that you work with other kids.\n \n The students may not be athletic, or may not like the clubs the school offers.\n \n For instance, if a student is shy and he or she has to work with a group and express ideas, or if they join a team and have to do certain tricks, their anxiety and stress may increase.\n \n Also, children can be busy, they have a life outside of school just like everyone else.\n \n They might have to take care of others.\n \n When taking care of others its hard to go to a club or sport after school, because when you get home your tired from your long day .\n \n That is not fare to the students because when they get home they will be tired, have to do homework, and take care of somebody.\n \n The kids may have appointments, like doctors appointments dentist appointments, or therapy appointments.\n \n Some appointments can be every night, depending on the circumstances but no oneÂ should miss their appointment.\n \n For example, a students has therapy appointments three times a week with his therapist he should not have to miss his appointments for any club or sport.\n \n In addition, kids may have money problems.

There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active.\n \n An extracurricular has different options to tryout. Trying out a extracurricular can be hard to choose. When you are trying out extracurricular you should find talents or skills that you are good at to find the perfect extracurricular. When I had to find a extracurricular I to choose activities that I am good at, or extracurricular that is joy able. Extracurricular is fun to explore out what kind of activities you are good and most joy able.\n \n Socializing with your friends is fun when you can hang out with your friends in a extracurricular. Socializing with your friends can be extracurricular, for example like a girl or boy's club or a book club can be ways of an extracurricular. Another, way you can socialize with your friends is making new friends in extracurricular. You to meet other people that might want to be friends with. I have friends and made friends in a book club while talking about the book and relevant topics.\n \n Having at least one extracurricular is a great to keep students active on the activity, finding different extracurricular's and socializing with your friends and making new ones. Keeping students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends are different ways of enjoying extracurricular and engaging students to themselves the activity that their are really interest into. So what I think about students participating in a extracurricular in school is that students should have an opportunityÂ to have at least one extracurricular.Â",

        "Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? Probably so, it'll be beneficial to them.\n \n I think that all students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because it'll give them a new experience, they'll meet new people, and depending on the activity, it can help them develop their future.\n \n An after school activity can give you a new experience, but how? Sometimes, you might not know exactly what you like, so an extracurricular activity could help you learn more about yourself. I mean, even if you dont like it you'll know not to do it again, right? Besides learning more about yourself, trying something new can just be good for you, especially if what you're doing is a sport or something that'll develop your future. Well, maybe your friends might want to brag to others that they were on the football team when they graduate. A sport or even an art activity could help you if you're applying to a job, but it would also give you, in a way, work experience, especially if you're applying to a job that is related to that activity when you're older. Even if you might not like the activity, it will be beneficial to you at some point.\n \n Meeting new people can benefit students. Sometimes, you might not have many friends who have the same hobbies, but when you're joining an activity, especially if it's something that you like, there's bound to be people that have the same hobbies. Who knows, maybe you might find a really good friend there. Meeting new people can make connections, connections are good to have when you're older and you might have a specific job to do. Maybe you might just need something and you remember your friend from that activity became a pretty great manager of a popular company. Usually, when you're joining an extracurricular activity, there's going to be people who are older than you and they have more experience in the activity you might've joined, it would be helpful to you to learn what they have been taught. It's good to learn from other perspectives, don't you think? Making new friends and meeting new people could ease stress with coming up tests, they'll help you relax a little more.\n \n Well, what if students don't want to participate? It can be difficult for a student to participate if something is happening outside of their school life. Sometimes, students might not be able to participate because of family, work, money, or time. There's a point in time where they will have to make exceptions. Besides that, usually it seems like the students around here might not do much outside of school, so they'll be kept a little busy with an activity.\n \n My final thought is that, of course, students should participate because they'll meet new friends, maybe even learn some new skills, and develop themselves and their future. So, go ahead and join an activity, you could really learn from it!",

        "Imagine going home and doing nothing but work, work, and more work. Being cooped up in the house and the only thing you could do is homework for hours. I think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. They will have the chance to do something that makes them happy. Something that will let their brain take a break from working so hard during school.\n \n Students will be able to make new friends and meet new people. Before I came to middle school I only knew the people from my elementary school and that was it. Until I joined chorus, I made friends with people that enjoyed music as much as I did. It was so much fun to be around new people and to make new friends. Even though we would have to stay after school to practice for up coming concerts it was still worth it. It gave me something to do after school and I could let my brain take a break from comprehending all the learning tactics that I have come across in school. I got the opportunity to do the one thing that makes me happy almost everyday. If students participate in an extracurricular activity it will give them a chance to open up to new people that may stay with them for a long time in their life.\n \n Students will have something fun to do after school. They would get to enjoy something fun that they may want to continue in their future. It gives them a chance to relax and enjoy the things they love to do outside of school. It will be a more enjoyable experience when they are doing something that really makes them happy. One of my friends loves to play sports and it makes her really happy. She was not worried about homework or getting something done right when she got home. Instead she got the chance to let her mind rest from all the learning and power on the part of her brain that helps her enjoy the sport that she loved. Students will have a better time concentrating on there homework after they have had time to relax by doing extracurricular activities.\n \n Students will have the opportunityÂ to learn something new whether it is a new instrument or a new sport. Every day in school you learn new things in all subjects but it is all surrounded around test and quizzes. But when a student decides to take an extracurricular activity they can learn something that will make them much happier and that does not involve test or quizzes. When I was in fourth grade I decided to start playing the violin. I understood that it was a big responsibility taking on something outside of school but it was worth it. I have always loved playing the violinÂ and I continue to play it now. Also I had to stay after school multiple times to practice with everyone in the orchestra. I learned how to make my brain stronger by doing something that was at a different level of difficulty in a different way.\n \n In conclusion, I think that student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. Students might discover something new about themselves that they did not know before they decided to take and extracurricular activity. Students should not have to work so much and not have any time to themselves. Everyone needs time to relax and do the things they love. By relaxing they give their brain a break to recharge and get ready for all the work that will come in the future.",

        "Student's usual school day lasts about 6-8 hours. After school, students usually like to kick back and relax. Some student's might actually have things to do after-school, like sports or schoolwork. However, if they're principal takes that privilegeÂ away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.\n \n Students also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.\n \n Being required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work. Late assignments will increase, which will bring down student's grades very quickly. More missingÂ work will increase, too, which will bring their grade down even more. Adding more after-school activities, whether it's academicÂ or not, will cause studentsÂ unnecessary stress.\n \n So whats the issue? After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.",

        "Your Principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Do you agree? Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills, build life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. Yes, i think that all students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\n \n Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills. Many people have various forms of social anxiety or they may just be naturally shy, but bonding over something you both enjoy doing can build true friendships that can last a lifetime. For example, i'm a competitive dancer, and i remember when i first stared dancing, i was shy and didnt like to do anything that was out of my comfort zone. Now i'veÂ been dancing for almost 9 years and my favorite people are my friends at my dance studio. While i started off shy and scared to talk to new people, i have become best friends with the people i was shy around, i believe if everyone does a club or activity, everyone would have amazing friendships like mine.\n \n Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social skills and a great way to build life skills too. soccer is a sport that builds control, endurance, and good sportsmanship, while a club like Beta club, is a club that builds leadership skills and gives you the opportunity to help those around you. There is something different with every activity, if you try and find a club or activity that helps to build the skills you are interested in or skills you would like build, then you might just end up having a good time and it might just be something you'll want to do as a profession.\n \n Clubs and Activities are a great way to build social skills, build life skills,and also a great way to enhance your future. Clubs and activities will build skills you will use for the rest of your life. If you do a academic club, you might win first place in a really big category, that win will look really good on your college application. If you do a sport, college scouts might be at your game and they might recognize you and give you a free scholarship to a college and maybe that college will be one you really wanted to go to. Clubs and activities can benefit your future in so many more ways then you might think.\n \n Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social and life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. when your principle asks you if your going to do an extracurricular activity, what will you say?",

        "Imagine you are at your high school graduation, your name gets called up and every one in your grade chants your name. You have came far for this opportunity to go to a top notch university. You would think that it was all of your teachers that helped you. But then you forget about your Math and Science Olympiad coaches, your basketball coach. I believe that schools need extracurricular activities. If my principal told made a rule that every one single one of the kids had to do a extracurricular activity, I would most likely sign up in at leastÂ two or three activities. The reasonsÂ why I think this are, You can learn Important life skills, you gain knowledge of things you didn't know before academically, and it can sometimes be fun.\n \n My first reason why you should have these activities were that you can learn a bunch of life skills that would very useful in the future. Like teamwork. Teamwork is a very important skill you need to learn. In the future when you get a job. You will need to work with your coworkers. Sometimes you know your coworker an other times you will get paired with someone you will not know. It is always very important to know how to work with other and communicate with them when necessary. My second example is that it teaches time management. When I was in Odessy of the Mind, I had little to know time to do my homework. So I would do my homework at school and not worry about it when I would get home. This is why so you can just chill in you home or do other priorities. Third and final example is Responsibility. Let's all be honest. We all learn responsibility when we were very young. I learned it before I started Preschool. I will give you an example on why responsibility is so important. You are playing football. You are the center. Your job is to snap the ball to the quarterback and block the big defensensive tackles and linebacker. If you don't do you are responsible for, then the quarterback will get tackled for a lose of yards, or he will get hurried to throw the ball and will throw a bad pass. This is why this skill is so important. You need to what your job is and how to do it.\n \n My second reason why you should have these activities is that you gain knowledge academically. When you go to a extracurricular activity to do with math or science, you will learn new things from an academical standpoint. Take math for an example. Let's say you are in 6th grade. You are talking an after school math advanced math class. Your teacher teaches you the Quadratic Formula. Look at you now, you are in 6th grade and you know how to do quadratics. Also, take science for an example. They teach you a ton of things, maybe you are in 7th grade and talking an extracurricular class of physics. Great job, now you know what a black hole is. Okay, my last example is that you are in student council, now you know how to stand up and talk to people and know how rules get passed. I could list hundreds of examples. But you can only do this if you have a positive mindset and be there only if you want to be there.\n \n My third and final reason is that you actually have a lot of fun. If you play a sport such as football and basketball, you get excited and have a ton of fun, Sometimes when in an extracurricular class, you have fun time learning new things that you are interested in learning. You can sometimes have a lot of fun and learn things academically to. You can reduce stress and anxiety, and it can exercise your brain. So from an entertainment standpoint. ExtracurricularÂ activities are really good.\n \n Well I believe that Extracurricular activities are very useful and great de to these three reasons, They teach you very important life skills, they teach you things from an academical standpoint, and the third and last reason was that they are really fun. Extracurricular activities are no classes that you have to get an A on. They are classes the you inquire knowledge out of. They are their to give you the knowledge that you need.",

        "\"\"well not all people like to do other things.\"\" Joining a different activity is not what a lot of people like to do very much. Kids dont really talking in front of a lotÂ of people because they could be shy or anything. When kids do a extracurricular activity they could agree with people and disagree with people because everyone don't have the same opinion. So I disagree because some could get hurt doing sports , they go visit family and they don't have time to do anything and people is not an out door person and don't talk that much.\n \n Kids could get hurt doing sports , like I was younger at my dad football practice and a boy pop his bond out of place so they call the ER and he had to get things done. Most kids hurt they self though out the year when they're doing sports because they could of been doing things wrong so they hurt themselves. Most people don't like going outside and doing that much activity or like playing sports. A lotÂ of kids like to be healthyÂ if they going to play a sports or anything and they keep their body in shape. Students shouldnt have have participate in a activity if they dont want to and i dont thing they should get force too if they dont want to do it at all.\n \n Most kids don't often go and visit they family so some kids go on trips and visit they family if they don't see them and things. It's good that kids go see they're family, also and kids are shy, they don't talk to people or they're not an outdoor person so they stay in the house and don't talk to no one. It would take up kids time if they want to go visit they family so I think kids should go visit they family if they don't see them that often and if they want to spend time with them. Most people worry about they family so they don't have time to go visit their family that much. Like my family that live far but not that far away from me i would go visit them and still be in things.\n \n Even tho kids are not an outdoor person or dont talk to that much people it they still dont have to do something they dont want to. Kids dont like staying after school for sports or anything only if its something fun and your helping out thats what kids like to do. Doing something could help but students shouldn't have to just do it if they dont want to and its theyre choice if they want to do it or not they dont have to get force to. A lot of kids just dont talk or nothing and they don't do nothing but talk to they friend or stay in the house and not do nothing. Most kids dont even have that much friends they could do or nothing so most kids dont do after school activitys.\n \n Kids just don't go outside or don't do something because they could get hurt or anything. Most kids love doing an activity with their school and then other kids just dont like doing something at all. So I disagree because kids shouldnt have to do something they dont want to do if its in school or out of school. They also dont have to be/get force to do anything. A lot of other kids are like teachers pet and do a lotÂ for teachers and even help out with a lot of teacher with a lotÂ of things . Kids are shy to even do extracurricular activity like help with year books , do sports or anything, most kids dont even see their family like they'er opposite to so kids dont do other activity or sports like that.

In the end, being forced to do something could reveal a talent.\n \n Lastly, kids can get really lazy at times and by forcing them to do and extracurricular activity can change their life. For instance, if they have weight issues then you could sign them up for a sport so they can loose some of that weight.

It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn\'t have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name\'s alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, ""Are you on your way to football practice?"" ""Unfortunately,"" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn\'t bad at football, he just didn\'t enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn\'t because too many people who didn\'t want to participate signed up. ""How\'s the student council?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,"" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn\'t have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn\'t enjoy it as much because those who didn\'t want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn\'t have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren\'t interesting to them.Â I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.\n \n The first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities.

Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after schoolÂ activities.\n \n Another reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they\'re being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won\'t be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn\'t interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren\'t provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don\'t wish to participate.\n \n In addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don\'t want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you\'re on a team, whether it\'s a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn\'t putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who\'s not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they\'re interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyableÂ if a student doesn\'t participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.\n \n Generic_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team\'s effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. ""Guess what?"" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. ""What?"" Generic_Name replied curiously. ""I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!"" ""Congratulations, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, ""See you later, Generic_Name."" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn\'t have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team\'s effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.',

        "How many times have you stepped out of your comfort zone? Maybe once or twice? People always hold back in life from doing something they have wanted to do. Maybe they are scared or fear of being judged. They don't take opportunities when they have it and might regret it later. Having to do another extracurricular activity could open so many doors, for example, meeting new friends, trying something new, and maybe even finding something you're really good at.\n \n You know when you meet a new friend, you're so excited and can't wait for all the fun things you guys will do together! If you did an extracurricular you could have so many of these moments. Making new friends expands your friend group. You can meet people that you probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been pushed to stretch your horizons. And all these people can introduce you to new things that they are interested in like their favorite movie, books, or even their own friends. You could do the same. At this point you might even have double the friends you had before you even did this extracurricular, wouldn't that be fun! Making new friends is just one of the many aspects of trying something new!\n \n For most people their is always that one thing they want to try but never do. Maybe chorus, art, robotics, etc. When you do this extracurricular you finally get the chance to do that one thing you've always had in the back of your mind. Say you tried this new thing, you put in your all in it, and you didn't like it or you weren't good at it. That's OK! Now you know that you tried it. You have no regrets. And you're probably going to have fun along the way even if it didn't end up being your passion. Doing this extracurricular could get you to the activity you always wanted to do even if it's not your life's calling.\n \n My dad always says, \"\"Don't knock it till you try it.\"\". Which basically means don't say you don't like it till you have given it a shot. This applies to so many things like sports, food the list goes on. This activity that you try could be what your really talented at. Maybe not given the opportunity you have never tried it. That would be so sad, getting a talent and you don't even know that you have it. That would just be a waste! If you get an opportunity like this it could lead to many things and even find what you were meant to do.\n \n Trying something new, making friends, and discovering what you're really good at is just a few of the possibilities if you do an extracurricular. Trying something different could open your world, and make you see things in a different light that maybe you looked down on before. You could finally find that one interest that you've been waiting for. And maybe that you're really good at too! Having to do another extracurricular helps you find friends and broadens your friend group! I really think that adding an extracurricular will benefit teens in many ways and really make them branch out which they probably weren't doing in the first place.Â",

        '"" What are you going to choose?"" That is the sound of a student at a school which requires them to do an extra- curricular activity. Students enrolled at this school must do some sort of extra curricular activity, whether it is a sport, a spot on the yearbook club, or serving on the student council. I agree with the requirement of an extra curricular activity because it can help you find people with the same interests and lead you to new interests, it can help create a better community environment and it will help all the students mature and succeed in the future.\n \n Participating in an after school activity can lead you to people that have the same interests and can lead you to other interests. i have been playing lacrosse for about 8 years now and as I\'ve played throughout the years, I have discovered many different hobbies through my teammates such as cheer leading, track and field and rock climbing. I\'ve also been able to make friends because I\'m on a different team every season. I have made about 3 lifetime friends in lacrosse. I think this can happen with school lead activities. I think by being part of an after school activity, you can make lifelong friends, find people with the same interests and discover new hobbies.\n \n Doing an after school activity can help create a better community environment. this kind of relate back to the previous statement about making friends.\n \n by making friends, you can create less bullying. there is this saying, ""strength in numbers"", and I truly think this would happen with an after school activity requirement rule. By installing an activity requirement, you would help build a bully-free community.\n \n Lastly, an after school activity would help students mature and prepare themÂ for the future. I babysit a little boy with downs-syndrome and i often take him to the park. When we leave, you tell he is a little bit more mature from when we first arrived. this is because hen has played with older kids and have copied their actions. I believe this goes with all kids. if we had an after school activity program and we put all the grades together, it would help the younger one mature but also the older kids could teach them how to do things that they will need to know in the real world.\n \n I think everyone should be involved in some sort of group, whether it be school related or not. Maturing kids, better community environments and finding new friends can all happen with a required after school activity program.',

        'Do you think students will have time to do at lest one extracurricular activity after reading this? Doing an extracurricular activity might not always bring good things to students. This can affect students in a lot of ways with other things they do after school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time, they can have other activities after school, and students can get stressed and tired.\n \n To begin with, one reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time. Students will not have time to do their homework after school. They might not have time to finish a project they been signed or to study for a test. Students will not have time to go out and hang out with their friends or spend time with their families. For example, students will not have time to eat dinner with their families.\n \n Next, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might already do other activities after school. Students might already participate in after school sport but no play a school sport. If students are 15 years or older they can start working and some students might want a easy after school job. They probably want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school. For example, take dance classes or instrument classes.\n \n In addition, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can get stressed and tired. If students get stressed their grades can go down and their parents can get mad. Students can get tired and sleepy in class and teachers will keep on saying, ""keep your head up"" during class. It will be hard for students to keep up with their work in class for example, they will not finish on time.\n \n Finally, students will not have time to finish their homework or projects they have and no time to be will their families and friends. They will want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school like other classes. If students do get into a extracurricular activity they can get stressed or tired and their grades might go down. This are the three reasons why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity after school.',

This will teach students many skills that could benefit them in the future.\n \n First off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. For example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. Joining a sport discovered many things I didn't already know about myself. I learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. Therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.\n \n Next, Joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. This leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. For example, I joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my bestÂ friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into.

        "To most students, school is like a black hole that they would do anything not to fall into. Kids go to school and sit for seven hours, and then go home and do almost the same thing. It's not healthy for them and it makes them dread school even more. Students are constantly falling asleep throughout the day because they don't have anything to look forward to, and that makes them feel as if school isn't as important as it is. If they don't have any fun, then they won't try in school whatsoever. If students are doing extracurricular activities, they'll be way more active and less tired throughout the day. I think that students should be required to do an extracurricular activity because it will get them involved in their school, it will keep them active in many ways, and they will learn more about everything around them.\n \n First, Extracurricular activities will get students involved in their school. For example, they'll be representing their school. You're representing your school in any activity you pick, but you especially if you're playing a sport. Sports teams are like little families in the school, and the people playing on them love their teammates and love the place they're playing for. If all the kids are required to do an extracurricular, and get to choose to play a sport, they'll get to meet lifelong friends and be the face of their school. This can make students love school so much more than they used to. Next, they will also be just as involved in their school if they do an activity like yearbook. In yearbook, you're constantly learning about the kids in your school and all your surroundings. Most kids barely get to know half of the people in their grade, but if they're learning about the people around them, they can get to know almost everyone. Finally, it'll be a chance for them to make new friends. As I said, most students barely get to know everyone they go to school with, and a lot of times they're to shy to try to get to talk to new people. When they're put in a club or an after schoolÂ activity, they learn how to communicate with others. Clubs could help so many people make new friends.\n \n Secondly, it will keep students active in many ways. For instance, playing a sport would be very good for any and all students. Constantly moving and exercising would help them stay active and fit, which is good for everyone. Most of your years in school you are required to do physical education, but sometimes you're barely even moving during the class. Sports will keep kids much more active than any class could. Also, being involved in an activity like student council or yearbook would keep their brains running and being used. They would always be coming up with new ideas and working on them/figuring out how to pursue them. When most students go home, they shut off their minds and are barely using them, causing them to not be as prepared to use them the next day. If they have to stay after schoolÂ for student council or yearbook, they'll still be using their brain. Lastly, students will actively learn communication skills. Communicating is so important in your life and will forever help you. You can't be in a club or play on a sports team and never learn how to communicate, because of this they will actively be learning new communication skills.\n \n Finally, these activities can help students be more confident. First off, some students think that they are alone in this world and that they is no one else is like them. If students join clubs that interest them, it'll show them that they are not alone and that there are other people that are similar to them. Even if they aren't doing something they're familiarÂ with, there will be other kids that are also trying it for the first time. Second, clubs and groups teach them how to talk to people. As I have said, you can't be involved in a group or on a team and not communicate with them. If students are basically required to talk to other people during the activities, it'll boost their confidence and help them talk to new people on their own. Last but not least, these activities will show them that they are good at something. It is very common for young kids to think that they are horrible at everything, especially if school and learning isn't their strong suit. These clubs can show them that they do have skills and are good at something.\n \n In conclusion, I think that students should have something to look forward to in school and not want to do anything to be out of going. They shouldn't have to wake up in the morning and dread going to a place they should love. This is why extracurricular activities should absolutely be a requirement. They have so many benefits and there will be many good outcomes. If extracurricularÂ activities become a requirement, students will become more involved in their school and everything around them, they will stay active in multiple ways and constantly be fit, and these activities will help boost up their self confidence.",

        'Whenever you get home, do you do your homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don\'t then you are either a very responsible kid, or you have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and the other half go home and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because it teaches the students responsibility, helps them with college later on, and they won\'t be on their phones all day.\n \n One reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach them to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while they are still in school, it will help them succeed in their later life as an adult.\n \n Another reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can help with finding a college later on in life. If you chose a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really help you in the future when you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are really good at a certain sport by the time of your sophomore year, you probably have a very high chance of making it on your school\'s team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if they think you are good enough for their school, they will probably offer you either a full-ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that they can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by ""earth gov"" asked adults which college they went to and if they were involved in an extracurricular activity during theirÂ high schoolÂ years. About 90% of adults said that they got into college due to a extracurricular they were involved in during high school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.\n \n On the other hand, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. They already have enough stress as it is, we don\'t need to add extra weight onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can help teens not spend the entire after school time on their phones. The article ""Are Phones Good for Teens"" writes, ""most of all teens have access to a smart phone, and once they are let out of school and get home, the average teen spends 5 to 76 hours on their phone instead of doing their homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities."" Another article titled ""Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College"" states that ""when kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat they are deeply involved in extracurricular activites like sports, working on their school\'s yearbook, or being on the student council of their school."" If the universe was filled with more kids like these then the world would have a larger population of successful young adults than it has right now.\n \n In conclusion all students should be obliged to be involved in extracurricular activities becuase it helps them learn how to be responsible in their future life, it can help student get into a good college and be successful in life, and it can keep students off of their phones all day. To save our earth, the first step is saving the future generation.',

Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity becauseÂ we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricularÂ activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.\n \n Extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.\n \n By taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.\n \n Being active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.\n \n Extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. Extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",

        "If you were told that you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, how would you feel? While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them. Schools shouldn't take away student's after school time, that time is the only time that they get to relax.\n \n Schools have a limited option of extracurricularÂ activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.\n \n A lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.\n \n After school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.\n \n With all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.",

        '""Get up and try something new,"" someone once said. Imagine if the local school had fun activities after school that got students minds off of all the stress in their lives. I agree with this statement because extra circulars can introduce new friendships and create fun while exploring hobbies.\n \n After school programs can provide new friends. Many people that join a club or school sport are just trying something that they haven\'t before and need some encouragement from a peer or someone to talk to. When I joined the school play last year it was a requirement to tryout. I was very nervous, but with the help of the rest of the cast I sang in front of a whole crowd and was cast a role. Sometimes there are students who are in the classes of others and may never talk to them, extra circulars are the perfect time to ask them questions and make them feel comfortable. In my History class there was a girl named Generic_Name, she was very shy but also very sweet. We rarely talked until we both joined the Best Buddies program and were partners for everything, we became very good friends and still talk to this day. Lastly, there is a chance to meet someone with similar interests as others. My mother met her best friend from the school basketball team when she was in junior high, they both loved basketball and continued to play together throughout high school. Extra curricular activities can bring together so many people and create new friendships.\n \n After school programs can bring so much excitement and joy into students lives by trying new hobbies. Extra circulars come in many forms such as; plays, art, sports, or even technology clubs. By joining a sports team the coaches provide fun activities while still exercising,Â and in a club like the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) the leaders teach life lessons and helpful skills. I am a NJHS leader and our goal is to plan meetings after school that others enjoy while being informed as well. In these programs there may be a hobby that people never knew they liked. My friend went to the field hockey interest meeting and learned all about the sport from real players, she had so much fun that she tried out for the high school team and made Varsity! The activities are also beneficial to more than one group of students. Some kids with disabilities stay after school waiting for a ride home from their parents, as a result programs were created for scholars to stay with them and help do entertaining projects. At many schools they have the ""iCan Bike"" club, a club also for kids with disabilities to learn how to ride a bike without training wheels, using help from student volunteers the club fund raisesÂ money for the Special Olympics. Extra curricular activities make trying new things fun and helpful.\n \n In conclusion, I agree that students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These programs can help others meet new people that are similar to them and create enjoyment with taking part in new hobbies that will provide happiness.',

        "I disagree with the principal's opinion or option because not everyone likes the listed activities or sports, or they maybe might just not do sports at all. It should only be a list of people who are actually willing to participate and follow directions, not just participate because they have to or are being forced to. Sports aren't meant for everyone or you might not just have the ability to do sports, if the students decide to not participate in sports or the other options it shouldn't be a big deal,some may not want to do an extra class. The principal's choice or option really shouldn't be a must. There should be an agreement with students about it and if some agree they should add extra options. not just sports, Work on the year book, Or serve on the Student Council. That is really only three activities and there might be more but not exciting or just not fun to do. That's why it wasn't mentioned and there is a lot of moving in those few options which includes excercising. So therefore I totally disagree with The Principal's opinion or option of making it a Must do. It can affect people's attendance. They could skip that class because Either they hate it, Maybe not their thing or choice, And not just skipping the class. They maybe just won't come to school at all when they have to do the activity they chose. And that's not what the principal is trying to prove or achieve. The Principal wants excercising and moving but students don't. and also aswell complaining. Students may whine a lot to their teacher saying stuff like I don't want to be here or disrespecting The Teacher who gladly decided to help out. So in my opinion I think it's just better to keep it the way it is right now and not add the option of must do sports or the other activities.",

        'Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all\n \n Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students and tremendously decreases the time that aÂ student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.\n \n Generic_School students should not have to regularly participate in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.\n \n Generic_School students should not have to consistently partake in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called ""Generic_Name\'s Work Zone"" or ""WWZ."" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name\'s Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be.Â That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.\n \n I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student\'s energy and can negatively impact a student\'s health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact.',

        "Your sitting home alone with nothing to do wastingÂ away with boredom, if so then you should do some extracurricular activity. I agree because, I think kids having to do extracurricular activities for school help them, and lets them help. These activities give kids things to do, may help them make friends, and gives them a chance to help others.\n \n First, extracurricular activities give young people something to do. This will get them out of their houses. These children have to go and help their team with the extracurricular activity that they chose. It will also make them use their brains. It teaches them to think outside of the box and to make creations from a thought. Lastly, it can also help them manage their time wisely. If they have other activities that give work or are near the same time, this will help them by learning what is more important or what they care more about. Some students might struggle to find time to do these activities, but they can chose what and when their activities should be.\n \n Secondly, these activities will help kids make new and lasting friendships. Make them work with others. Because these are all run by the school you will have to meet new people regardless, so why not try to make a lasting impressionÂ to the people you work with. Have them go on group outings. The children may not be friends with anybody yet and are looking for something to do, group activities are prefect, not only do you do fun stuff with your group, but also get to know them a bit better. They will help each other. If you have problemsÂ with home work or a problem with some one around school the others in your group can, and will help you with the problemsÂ that you may have. Kids may be shy and don't want to talk to others they don't know this will help them break the ice with a few people so they have some friends to hold them up.\n \n Lastly, this gives them a chance to help others. They can help friends. if a friend needs help on understanding their part of the extracurricular activities or home work then you can help them to understand what they are suppose to do. You can help the school. If you are in student council and think of a way to better the school then you have the power to do what you think is right for the school and students. Finally, this give students a chance to help the community. The students could find ways to benefit the place where they live making it cleaner, safer, or in anyway better. If someone is having a hard time think of how good it would feel to help them out.\n \n Extracurricular activities do influence kids to better themselves, their school, and community. One way was giving these students something to do to improve themselves. Another is making new friends making others lives better helping both school and community. Last is helping others in any way needed for home work, a project, or just by listening. Think of how much better it would feel to help others even if you didn't want to join an extracurricular activity.",

        "My principal, Mr. Generic_Name, has just announced that all students are required to participate in one activity around the school. I think that is is a great idea for Middle and Elementary school! But some of the students don't like the idea as much. I agree with my principal's decision to require at least one extracurricularÂ activity. Whether it's encouraging students to learn something new that they like, getting to know others and making friends, or to spark a new hobby/interest. Here are my reasons and elaboration as to why I think this.\n \n My first reason is that some of your time in Middle School should be spent doing something that you enjoy learning. The Loudoun Times have written about other schools doing the same change as what Mr. Generic_Name just announced. A writer for the Loudoun Times interviewed students at one school and 1 out of 5 students interviewed didn't like the idea at first, but when the interview happened again in the middle of the school year, that ratio changed to 4 out of 5.\n \n Another reason why at least one extra curricular activity is good, is that you get to know others and make friends! CBS reported on a camp that was held in the Summer for exactly one week, which had kids aged 11 to 14 from 10am to 7pm, with 23 kids total, and activities of hiking, four square, camping, and more. All of the students except one had reported making at least one friends that they, later on in the camp, gave contact information to. I know this isn't in a school setting, but this proves that students can be the same way when doing a fun activity that they signed up for. If you like Tennis for example, you can play with other people in Tennis that share the same interest.\n \n The last sentence brings me to my next reason, which is sparking a new hobby/interest. The University of Virginia had 20 8th graders choose something new to learn. The options were, Guitar, Tennis, and Basketball. 16 out of 20 8th graders liked what they chose. The next day, having all of the 20 8th graders either choose something new, or choose something different, 13 out of 20 choose the same option that they chose yesterday. One student when interviewed, said that he liked Guitar and hoped he could learn more about it in the future. That one student probably now has a new interest of Guitar as well as the other students who chose their activity for both of the two days. The people who chose the activity for only one day at least have an idea of what isn't for them.\n \n I have just told you my reasoning! My 3 reasons have now told you why I support Mr. Generic_Name's decision of requiring at least one extracurricularÂ activity. Making friends, getting to know other people, sparking a new interest, and having people choose something that they just want to see if it's for them. At least one of these reasons can help students when choosing their activity and make them feel better. Mr. Generic_Name clearly made the best choice for our school.",

      essay:
        "Did you know schools in your area have decided all students must participate in at least one after school activity? Incredible news if you ask me. Being involved in extracurricular activitys has shown to have amazing results on young growing minds. They're good for your overall health, they improve your skill sets and have a helpful impact on schools.\n \n Firstly, Being required to do a type of interactive activitly are not only expressive and fun but improve you mental and physical health. For example when playing a sport you practice getting stronger, improving your active ability and are getting in shape. You gain muscle and strength throughout your body. Your running gets much cleaner and your breathing gets more controlled. When I was really serious about my dancing skills I noticed a huge build up of leg muscle. Through out the years I've gotten alot stronger in my core and arms. Mentaly being active can take your mind of off hard times in your life. If you had a bad day at school or haven't been feeling your best, being active can make you feel alot more calm and have less anxiety. It takes you to a safe place. Every child should have access to something like that and the fact that not all kids do needs to change. Personally when I get in a fight with my parents I like to go for a run outside or play vollyball with my friends. I always end up feeling happier. Sports can also allow students release any anger or upset feelings they have. Some kids struggle with mentle health issues and don't all have resources to help. Playing a sport or being active can allow you to get ride of the upset feelings in a healthy way that won't harm anyone. I notice this can be a way to cope. It's okay to be angry but it's not okay to take your anger out on others or cause harm. There's also many ways after school activties can improve your different skill sets, here's some examples in the following.\n \n Secondly, extracurricular activitys helps improve your different emotinal skills. You learn to be more dedicated. When you playa sport or apart of a club you're on a team and you need to be there for one another. When you miss a practice you're not only letting yourself down but you're letting your team down too. When someone misses a practice on my dance team it's hard for all of us. We have reblock dances or fill in peeple who arn't there. It's more work for us which is unfair. You also learn to be more motivated. You start to set goals for yourself and strive to achive those goals. It can work with your school and home life too. Motivation can also make you more confident and work harder to be successful. I used to struggle with feeling motivated but when I stared dancing I found a strive for working as hard as I can to get better. It can be stressful but it's worth it. Dedication is also a skill that is getting worked on. Being dedicatied is always doing your best no matter how easy something is. Dedication is found when you try your best and go above what is required. If your apart of a yearbook club you learn to stay dedicated to finish the book and make it look as good as it can. You don't give up when it gets too hard. Your school does alot for you and you should always give back to what you get in return.\n \n Lastly, participating in after school activities helps improve you school. When being apart of sports your school provides, that's a way of donating money. You have to pay for things when you're apart of a team ( outfits, games ect). When giving money to your school it helps pay for field trips, better lunches, classroom design and lots more. My old school was able to have amazing field trips because we saved money from donations. Some after school activites can include art clubs, design groups and student council. We could make groups that help clean up trash around the school, let kids get creative and have art work around the school and create new ways students can express themselves and help others. The student council could be in charge of these groups and ensure work was being done. Finally after school groups and activites can help teachers and staff. School's are very dirty and it's a lot of work for only a few staff memebers to have to clean. Cleaning clubs could be a great way students can give back to our school. We could clean the floors, windows and bathrooms. Competive sports teams are a way to get our schools name out there so people pick going to our school rather than any others. If we have good sports teams that win parents will notice that and could end up sending their kids to our school. I have many friends that have moved schools to have better luck in getting into collage through good sports teams at their schools.\n \n In conclusion, schools requiring all students to endore one after school activity not only shows they care but improves your health, adds to your skill sets and is very helpful for your school and making it a better place. Students may not be as joyful in the begging but will soon notice a huge postive change and outlook towards school everyday. What is your take on this topic ?",

        "Have you ever participated in an activity where you either loved or hated it? Well, believe it or not, I think that all extracurricular activities should be appreciated. Extracurricular activities are activities used to equip you with new skills that you may not have had before, not used to only have fun and learn nothing from it just because your parents forced you to do it. They are there for a reason, and should be taken advantage of. I agree with the decision of the principal for making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity for three reasons: it gives you the opportunity to learn a life lesson, it can improve your academic performance, and gives you a chance to make new friends.\n \n The opportunity given to you to learn a life lesson can be rare. To learn a life lesson means to realize that this world we live in, isn't fair nor perfect. There will be times where you wish certain things had happened to make life better for you, but that just simply can't happen. Participating in an extracurricular activity can create memories and meaningful experiences that you can't experience anywhere else. It can also help with being disciplined, and can give you something to live for. That is why I think that taking part in an extracurricular activity can be life-changing.\n \n The act of participating in an extracurricular activity can even improve your academic performance. Depending on the activity, it can motivate students to do better if a certain activity requires you to have good grades in school. Participation in these activities can relieve stress, and looks good on your resume for college applications. Experiences from the activity can be stored up in your brain to be used as background knowledge in the future. Those reasons tie into the fact that taking part in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory.\n \n A chance to make new friends is always exciting for everyone. Making new friends also means making new relationships with the people you care about. Having people that you care for, rather than having random strangers around you, doesn't give you a sense of loneliness. It brightens you up like the sunrise, when you see the first beam of light. Making new friends especially while participating in an extracurricular activity makes it more fun, and amusing. It gives you an electric shock of joy, making you excited to come back again the next time. That is why I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity would be beneficial.\n \n Many people say that students should have a choice whether or not they would like to participate in an extracurricular activity, but I believe that it should be more of the opposite. The opportunity to learn a life lesson, improve your academic performance, and make new friends are the three reasons why I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Therefore, when you meet a student that currently doesn't participate in an extracurricular activity, invite them to join you, or find an activity that you think they would enjoy. This would be a great opportunity for everyone because they would be able to relieve their stress, do something that they love to do, and would enjoy every second of the activity, spending time with the ones they care about the most. Overall, I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of all the benefits, and the giant footprint that it would leave on this planet.",

        "About 57% of schools students participate in extracurricular activities. This means that over half of every school has students that already participates in an activity. I disagree with this decision because some students do not have time after school, don't have the transportation afterwards, or not interested.\n \n With this added, where will they find the time for their home life?\n \n First, I disagree because some students have a job after school. Some students have to work that job to help support, so having this added would just add to their stressful life. Second, some students have to help their familiesÂ withÂ things such as chores, make dinner, etc. If they have to stay at school longer, some of those important things wouldn't get done. Third, as we get older we get more homework and harder tests, so it's up to us to keep up with it. After school is the time where the students get to study or do their homework, so when would they do it if they have to stay after school everyday?\n \n Not every student has transportation afterwards, so what do students do when no one can pick them up? First, parents are busy people and have jobs too. Some parents just can't leave work to get their child. Second, if they don't have a ride, they will have to wait with a teacher until someone can pick them up. Thats not fair to the teacher, but to the student too. Third, students would have to bug other busy parents to ask for a ride home. Their friends parents can't always take them home, so on those days how do they get home?\n \n Some students just aren't interested, so why make them do something they don't want to do? First, if they are not interested, they most likely wont be paying attention. If the students not even paying attention, whats the point of even having them there? Second, they would be distracting the people that want to be there. If a student isn't into what they're doing, they are most likely gonna move a lot, make noises, or talk to the people around them. Third, they most likely wont put any effort in what they are doing. No one wants to be around the kid that doesn't do their work, so whats the pointÂ in them coming if the aren't going to put in the effort?\n \n In conclusion, that's why I disagree with the decision. I believe that every student should have the choice of whether they participate or not, due to those factors.",

        "I agree with this 100%. Choosing an Extracurricular Activity is very important. Let me tell you why\n \n Extracurricular Activities can help with Social Skills. For Example if I am suffering from depression it gives me the chance to do something that would take my mind away from the depression. Another reason would be if you have anxiety you can play or choose an activity that relaxes you and just lets you escape from all the anxiety around you. One major point is working better with other people. Extracurricular Activities can help you as a learner work better with others. For Example my Granddad is in the Construction business and when you have jobs like that and teaching and pretty much any job you have to know how to collaborate with other people. This brings me to my final point Extracurricular Activities can help your Social Skills.\n \n These Activities can help with Social Activity as well. Like for example it give people who might not have friends or the best of friends a chance to make new ones whether it is through Sports or another type of Club. Another reason is because it gives you the opportunity to get closer and create a bond with friends and maybe even family. Plus there are many different clubs to choose from. These activities can help you stay fit and healthy as well. It also gives you the opening to meet new teachers and coaches that you might be able to start a bond with.\n \n There are many different options to choose from. If you like sports you could play football or basketball or even soccer or baseball. If you like to test your brain power you can join chess or checkers club. And last but not least if you like to speak in front of people public speaking. This is one of my classes that I strongly encourage people to take to help with speaking in the workplace. Art is another option if you like being creative.\n \n So my conclusion is choosing an Extracurricular Activity is important especially in High School and College.",

People might not agree with this but, all I can do is speak for myself.\n \n Why, do i agree with such a thing?. I agree with this desicion because, this desicion could do everyone some good. Doing some type of sport or even working on the school news paper could be fun. It would be expecially good for parents. Why? you might ask because, the students won\'t come home as early, and the parents will have time to run erin\'s and get some stuff done before their children get home. The parents will also be able to just have more time to their selves.\n \n Also, this could be helpful to the children mentally and physically. Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television. These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren\'t up to par to look like ""pretty"" people they can get sad and form some type of depression.\n \n Overall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity\'s to the students day can help with that. building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you\'ll atleast know some key factors to living. Building social skills is great too. Lets say you get a job in marketing, you need to be social, have great speech, and be outgoing. In fact, you need social skills for any job. The principle making the desicion to add an extracurricular activity\'s to students day at school was and great idea.\n \n In conclusion, adding an extracurricular activity to all of the student body would be an great idea because, it could be benifial to students, parents. and teachers. Building social skills. Life skills, and just being productive has all to do with adding an extracurricular activity to a students day. I think i have stated what my opinion is and what i agree and disagree with. What my opinion is, is that the principle making that desicion is wise and thoughtful.',

        "The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These extracurricular activities include sports, student council, work on the yearbook, and other activities. This will force students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. I disagree with this requirement, for it can be stressful, it forces the students who dislike these activities to participate, and it takes away time for their other responsibilities.\n \n First, students might find extracurricular activities stressful. Students who dislike having to work with others are forced into an uncomfortable situation when they are forced to participate in extracurricular activities along with other students. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and some students may not be able to because they have responsibilities at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of homework and other responsibilities at home.\n \n Then, their grades may drop. If a student is required to leave class for their extracurricular activity while doing something important in class like notes then their grade may drop because they missed that work. Students may have work for an extracurricular activity and that work may pile up with work from their other classes. For example, My friend Generic_Name does student council and we were taking notes in class when they made an announcement for all student council members to meet in the library and Generic_Name ended up missing all of the notes for the test the next day.\n \n Also, students may have other responsibilities at home. Students my have responsibilities at home like walking their dog, cleaning the dishes, doing laundry, and other responsibilities. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and that takes away the time for the responsibilities the have at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of my homework and other responsibilities at home.\n \n However, students may enjoy extracurricular activities. Students may choose to participate in extracurricular activities, for it can be a way to have fun, you get to spend time with friends, and it gives you a time away from all of the stressful school work. For example, I do not get to spend time with friends during class because we are working and extracurricular activities can be a way for me to see friends and have fun. That is why some students may choose to participate in these extracurricular activities.\n \n In conclusion, Students who are forced to participate in after school activities may lose time for school work, responsibilities, and personal time. When a student is forced into an activity that they dislike it they might slack off and that can distract other students who care about their activity from thier work. Students should have a choice of what they do during and after school because it can affect their attitude towards their school work. That is why I disagree with the principal's requirement.",

        "Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.\n \n Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school because it can help you make new friends, help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity, and can improve your skills on specific things. If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people, but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy because most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured.\n \n Being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that. Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.\n \n Generic_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. When he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high schoolÂ and was really looking forward to it.",

        "Today was a long day at school wasn't it? You did a lot of work. Studied hard. Maybe you even spent two blocks typing an essay for your SOL. Wouldn't it be nice to take a break and do something you enjoy? I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n \n To start, activities can help kids make new friends and socialize. An article published by NOVA stated that \"\"87% of students that participate in after schoolÂ activitiesÂ make a friend that they previously weren't friends with.\"\" That's a large number. Based on the study, students make friends more frequently when they are in the same club or activity as someone with the same interest as you. I think that making new friends and having fun in an activity is something everyone should experience. In the same article, it states that \"\"kids that share the same interest tend to develop a stronger friendship than kids with opposite interest and personalities.\"\" The easiest way to find someone that shares interest with you is to go to a club or activity. You'll meet people with the same liking as you. I actually met my best friend at a extracurricular activity. We were both in the same club, meaning we share somewhat of the same interest, so we started talking more, and we became best friends.\n \n Another reason is, kids can take a break from school and relax for a while. A study done by the Virginia Health Department shows that \"\"the average kids aged 11 and older that play a sport or do an activity they love, have their stress level decreased by up to 67%. It can also help clear their mind from all the bad and corruption going on around them.\"\" When I play basketball, everything that I'm thinking about clears and I stay focused on the game. At that point, I know longer feel stressed or worried about anything going on around me. I think that's always a good thing to do. Just have fun and relax. Don't be stressed or worried about anything. Just enjoy yourself. Another article by Richard Sampson, writer for the Washington Post, stated that \"\"playing a sport or participating in an activity showed to be just as effective, if not more effective than meditation. It clears and calms the brain and body while having fun and enjoying oneself.\"\" Having fun, and being stress free? That sounds like a win-win situation to me. I think it's a great thing to do. You lose stress and have fun. Why wouldn't you want to do an extracurricular activity?\n \n On the other hand, students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity if the don't want to. A study done by the LoudounÂ County Public Activities Club (LCPAC) showed that students that were forced to sign up for and activity didn't have fun or enjoy them self. I don't think that making someone sign up for an activity is a good idea because they won't have fun. However, it's always good to try something new. If they don't like the activity they signed up for, then they don't have to do it next time. Try something else. Activities are supposed to be a fun, enjoyable time.\n \n To bring it all together, extracurricular activities should be something all students do. It brings fun, joy, new friends, and takes away stress and anxiety. That sounds like a great opportunity to me. Contact your principal at school. Get activities started at your school. Or, sign up for one outside of school. Trust me, you will love it!",

        "I feel as if everybody should be in a club or on a sports team or at least just engaging themselves with something else instead of regular old school. I agree with my principal with making it so students have to participate in a least one extracurricular activity because, everybody needs something to do outside of school. You can join a club and meet new friends and new people, you can find things that you like to do that you never even knew you liked.\n \n Every kid needs to be doing outside of school, i heavily suggest sports for kids, more importantly a team sport. Being on a team sport teaches you how to be a leader and a team player. At the same time you are getting great exercise that your body needs. Kids need to be kids and having them play sports is a great way to let them go and be kids. You learn a lotÂ of valuableÂ life lessons when you play a sport, some that might stick with you your whole life. Also kids doing something like playing sports or volunteering somewhere can help from get kids off the streets getting involved with drugs and committing crimes.\n \n Besides sports and doing things outside of school, another great way to get into and extracurricular activity is joining a club. Joining a club could be beneficial for someone who has a hard time making new friends. If you join a club you might find yourself interested in something you never even knew that you liked. Say you have a hard time making new friends, if you join a clubs that has to do with something that you really like you are bound to find some new friends because you are surrounding yourself with other people who have the same interests that you do. Also more schools should have more variety of clubs and things to do after school to make school a more enjoyable place.\n \n Another great thing about participating in extracurricular activities is that you can find new hobbies that you like that you never even heard of or that you've never tried. If your not sure if you should join that club or play that sport just do it, because if you don't and you realize what could've been a good experience is thrown away because you did notÂ want to try anything new. It's okay to step out of your comfortÂ zone every now and then. It may be fun or it may not, you just got to find yourself and what you like, experimenting with things is great for you. Don't second guess yourself, the more you second guess the more your talking yourself out of doing it.\n \n InÂ conclusionÂ it should be schools jobs to make sure kids are putting themselves in clubs and sports etc. to succeed and have a better life. I highly agree with my principle making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity inside and outside of school, my principle needs a raise. Â Â Â Â Â Â",

I agree with Making kids participate in an extracurricular activity because it would fix this problem by making kids participate. One reason why Being forced to participate in an extra curricular activity could benefit these kids is because it could make them more have more hobbies and goals. The next reason why making them participate in extracurricular activities would be good for them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and become successful of them. Another reason why forcing them to participate would be good is because It could allow them to develop better social skills and become a better person.\n \n One reason why forcing them to do activities would benefit them is how they could develop new hobbies and goals. For example, when I started swimming my parents forced me to go to practice even when I didÂ notÂ want to. Now I am a competitive swimmer and enjoy going to practice because I have goals that I want to accomplish. This example shows how making someone participate in something can sometimes benefit them by giving them new hobbies and goals.

But now I have made running one of my hobbiesÂ and I will try out for my high schoolsÂ cross countryÂ team. This example shows how I was being forced Into running and started out not liking it but now I do.

Another example of how making students participate in an extracurricular activity could make them more successful Is how my brother became a successfulÂ piano player. My parents made him start taking Piano lessons and now he has become great at Piano and may try to become are school Piano player.

All of these examples show how It would be good for the principle to make the students participate in an activity because it would make them a more successful person.\n \n Another reason why making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them Is how they could develop better social skills and become a better person. An example of this is when I was in fourthÂ grade and I did not like to talk to people. But when my parents signed me up for a activity after school that would help go around helping people and do food drives I became involved with the program and started to talk to people finding ways to help others. This example shows how I developed better social skills and I became a better person by helping others. Another example of how extracurricular activities help develop myÂ social skills is when I joined my first Triathlon team I had work hard to keep up with my team and cheer for other teammates. This example shows how I was using social skills to cheer for my teammates and why extracurricular activities could benefit students.\n \n I agree with Making students do extracurricular activities.

        "Should all students be required to do an extracurricular activity? Yes, I do agree that all students should do some form of activity. There are many types of after school activities that students can participate in, including clubs, sports, debate teams, and so much more. I myself have done so many extracurricular activities. So many I couldn't count them all. I do believe that all students should do a extracurricular activity because, it can improve friendships and social interaction, encourage good exercise and motivation in work, study, and nutrition habits, and make it easier for students with health problems to interact with other kids their age and feel involved.\n \n Friends are very important in our lives. When were kids mostly everyone finds that one person who you can laugh with, make jokes with, have your own secret language, and just be kids! If you ever had that one person, think back to how you met them. Did you just bump into themÂ going down the street and all of a sudden ya'll were best friends? That might be a slight possibility but fighting the odds you most likely met your childhood best friend by doing something that you like to do. Thats right an activity! Children need best friendsÂ and whether they try out for the football team or join the debate team, I do believe that you will find a new best friend.\n \n Although friends and a very important thingÂ in a stable childhood, exercise and motivation has just as much as a positive or negative consequence on your life. Motivation is a enormous thing that can push you to do anything that you want to do. Joining teams and clubs will not only make you friends but give you peers and trusted adults that will be right behind you for whatever you choose to do. Motivation is also the key to exercise. exercising as a kid will keep you a happy and healthy person for years to come. As the years do come youll find yourself in great habits, keeping yourself healthy. Healthy habits are not the only thing. Its proven that the happier and healthier you are the more you may put into your life. If you just sit on the couch all day not doing anything, your not going anywhere with your life.Â Good exercise and good motivation are very important things and inheriting those traits just from joining a sport or club, is a huge win.\n \n Now lets talk about the children who are physical and mentally challenged. Yes, they might not have the same mindset as you and me, or can't move some part of their body, but that does notÂ mean that they shouldnt have just as much as a chance as you and me. I think incouringing special education students to enjoy the wonders of childhood are just as important as it was for everyone else in the world. When you involve these children, at that second they won't see that their different, they will see thatÂ their with kids their age having fun. Because their kids, they should have equal opportunities as other kids. Let them joinÂ that sports team if they are willing to do and and have their mind set on what they want to do. Who is to stop them?\n \n As more and more children start to do extracurricular activities more and more will follow. So Yes, I do believe that children should be pushed to do extracurricular activities, because if they dont, they might have just given up a huge part of their childhood that they might never get back. As you get older you might still have that best friendÂ still sticking around, or you might still have those study habits and healthy habits, or you might have had been a person that decided to be such a kind person and have that special education kid join your friend group as because you knew everyone needs a friend. No matter what it is, all their is to know is that you gained something so positive that will be stuck with you for decades.Â Â",

        "I think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. First it could interfear with there scedule, second it could get in the way of school and lastly it could induce stress.\n \n First the childs scedule. Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.\n \n Second it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.\n \n Third is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress. The activites could cause the child to lost sleep and that could leave the child tired and stressed for the rest of there school day. Next it could cause to much stress and that can lead to unwanted sideffects, like hair lost pail coloring of skin, hair loss and suicidal thoughts which isnt good.\n \n Thats whyI think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity.Â",

        "All students must do at least one extracurricular activity. That's what the principal said. I agree with his statement because students are allways stressed about home work,missing work,getting in trouble and friends. An extracurriculer activity is ment for you to have fun and be your self. Lets say your working on the year book and it is a lot of work but the whole school depends on you to do a good job. Now sports sports are a cool way to make friends and have teamwork that way you can acomplish your goal as a team.\n \n Every student has a life out side of school whether that be waching tv,playing video games,spray painting biuldings or walking dogs. They all have lives but not a single one of them is the exact same. That's why we can get the kids who are good to have fun and the kids who are bad out of trouble. We could make the town a better place one kid at a time. This idea will also help with kids who don't have good grades.\n \n By not letting them play or commpete if the dont have good grades that lets them work harder to get better grades.\n \n A big part of life is being productive.

It'sÂ about getting thigs done and being usefull with your time. some kids dont play outside dont talk to their friends the play video games and wach tv. why do that when you could be playing sports,working on year book photos,talking on the debate team and doing there work for school.

It is bad enough that your parents make you do the activity, but what if your principal made you do it. This is why I disagree with our principal making us do extracurricular activities. It is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.\n \n It is our life not the principals. If we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. Principals job is to be in chargeÂ when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. Life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. We are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. We should get to decide our own path not the principal.\n \n Most kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. They might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. Extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.\n \n Kids don't always have time. Some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. They need their families help to fight through these tough times. If they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. If the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. Everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.\n \n I disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. I don't think forcing people to do them is the answerÂ to every bodiesÂ problems. Extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. It should be up to the family what is done not our principal.",

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricularÂ activity because it helps with college prep, helps with stress, and doesn'tÂ take much time.\n \n Working on a extracurricular can helps you prepare for college. When you send in your college application they not only look a grades but what you bring to the table. If you play football they might want you for there football team or if you play in band they might want you for there school band. Colleges also give out scholarships for certain activities. If you were good enough at your extracurricular you may even qualify for financial help to pay for college. It shows that you can stick with something and that you are a hard worker and you can keep working even when something is new and difficult. Colleges look at these kinds of things its important to be prepared and accomplished.\n \n Taking a break in the middle of the day and going to a fun class that you choose can really help with stress. It lets you take a break between your academic classes. You some times end up sitting for hours doing math,science, and reading you can become tired and stop focusing. Taking a hour to thirty minutes to stretch, run around, and talk is good for you it can help with your drowsiness and boredom. Taking a break and doing something you love and enjoy could only benefit you. Sports or things like art also improve motor skills and can have a calming affect they can also increase melitonin production in your brain which helps with anxiety and depression. Not only does this mean that it can help with any conditions you may have but also allows personal improvement to take place. Taking time for yourself and picking a class you will enjoy can help you reduce stress.\n \n Some people may say that its a wast of time and you could be doing something academic with that time and that other activities would be more appropriate for the school day. however, there are academical purposes for these activities you could learn a language or take a extra class to get help with math. It is all up to what you want to do with that extra class. Spending six hours of your day sitting and doing work only to get a break to eat is not good for you. If changing that means you waste a half a hour to just run around or talk then so be it.\n \n Some my look at these classes and say they are a waste of time and a distraction from the important classes but the also help in the long run.\n \n Students need to take a break and join a class they enjoy it will help them with college prep, although them to take a break, and is a good use of there time.

Adding the rule that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity would be a fantastic way to make sure that students are getting involved with their school. There are so many choices for everyone in the school. From sports, to crafting, Future Business Leaders, and many more, students are sure to find something that they enjoy. Doing extracurricular activities can help make friends, keep you active, and form a second family away from home. It can also help you later in life with time management skills, and help keep your grades up.\n \n A benefit that comes with joining a team, club, or organization with other people is making friends. It's hard to make friends at school because of constant changing classes and so many people split up. Especially when it comes to sports, you can form a second family. Being on a team, you know that people have your back during a game. After being involved with the same group of people, you start to form a bond that makes everyone so close. Having an outlet with people that you know, and are close to, can really have a positive impact on you're life.\n \n Later on in life, students will remember the work that they put in, and remember the friendships that they made.

To have a kid feel relaxed and at peace will improve what they think as they wake up on Monday mornings.\n \n In the school I have attended for junior high, I am required to take classes that focus on music. In the sixth grade, I chose orchestra because it was an amusing experience to see how one movement in my wrist could cause a pleasant noise to be heard throughout the room.

That might not be the reason, you could be struggling in your studies because of the school activity your told to do. i know my parents would be disapointed in me for having bad grades. I definetly don't support the principles decision of making it a requirement for students to participate in an activity.\n \n Some parents make their kids run errands, doing so may lead them to not be able to participate. They might have younger siblings they have to watch over which makes it hard as well. Students of extra assistance might not be able to do the activities. As the year will go by, studies will get more advanced. Students might get stressed, with the activity on their hands they might get more stressed. I know how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed as a student, things are harder to get done with being pressured. People have different things going on in their lives, it might be hard for them to go to school if there family are not in their llife as much. They could live far away from the school and have no tranportation for school or attending their own game practices.\n \n I think they should require only what is mandatory to pass the current grade students are in. Sport, running for student council, or participating in a school related event should be optional. Some people don't like participating in sports and all these other things, it just might not be their thing. Parents might wanna put their kids in tutoring after school because of their grades, but unfortunatly they can't because they got game practice or school duties. All of these problems caused by the principles decision will lead to students transferring to another school. It might also put a bad name on the school.\n \n The staff and teachers at the school might be paid a smaller amount of money than their regular pay. If there are no students at the school, the teachers might quit their jobs. The school might shut down, we can't let this happen. If we all work together we can make a big change! We can talk the principle out of this, make students happy, and parents proud again! The parents and students lives wont be so stressful anymore.\n \n Finally, that is why i reject having to participate in an school activity. I want to study stress free and have my life at ease. Students should participate in school activities only if they want to. They shouldn't be forced to if it's not required. I would reccomend the principle to come out with more previleges to help students with their studies intead!",

        "Everybody works when their kids, and when their adults. Kids work so hard in school, and rack up so much homework, it overflows them everyday when they get home. When you have so much work, and so little time to do things you love like spending time with your family the homework gets in the way of that. School takes over your life which is a good thing, and a bad thing. It can be a good thing because you learn so much which can help you excel in life, but it can take the life you should be living when your a kid. A kid should be able to play outside with friends, and go to the pool to swim but they can't.\n \n Making a kid have to do more school work, and stay longer at school would just give them more stress. More stress would make a kid become overwhelmed, and not do as well as they used to with less stress. Adding a extra activity to a kids life would just take away the name kid, a kid should be with his/her family, or outside running around. Schools need to have extra actives for kids, but they should never force a kid to do them.\n \n Don't make a kid work more and add more stress to their life you should be taking away the stress.\n \n As a kid to much work just makes a kid not want to work. If you force a kid into adding an extra activity to their seclude it just ruins the childhood they should be having. A kid should make his/her own choices in which what they want to do as a kid. Kids need to have fun, and play around and be close with there family, but adding an activityÂ is like adding a year to a prison sentence, you are stuck in some place you don't want to be at. I believe that all kids should get to chose either if they want to do the extra activities or if they don't. School is just one big heartbreaking place where kids have to sit around all day, and then go eat food which no one knows what it actually is.",

        "According to Dr. Maxwell Olchena, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains, participating in marching band can do one of two things depending on your personality, just wait until you see what his studies have proven! I think it's very important to do an extra curricular activity, but I do not believe it should be required, as we just do not have enough options for extra circulars to fit every student's desires. Some extra circulars, such as marching band, are not for the light of heart and truly are scary at points(especially drum line but we'll get into that later.) This is why students should do extra circulars, but it should not be a requirement.\n \n Dr. Maxwell Olchena is a psychologist who has been studying the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains for almost 20 years, here's what his studies have shown: there are two things marching band can do to the brain of an adolescent, and however they are affected depends on their personality and nothing to do with IQ(Intelligence quota). Those with higher IQs tend to perform better in marching band, although marching band does not require you perform well(as hard work brings good performance.) The two things that can happen to the brain of an adolescent when they join marching band are, increased mood and productiveness, or decreased mood and productiveness, thats right. Marching band can do two polar opposite things to the adolescent brain. Dr. Olchena's studies have shown that when someone considered an extrovert joins marching band, their mood will decrease and they will become burnt out, this is because they aren't used to the amount of work put into their social life. Marching band is less a sport and more of a social activity, unless you are willing to accept it as your only family, you will not be happy and become very burnt out. Here's where Olchena's studies get crazy, introvertsÂ are more likely to have increased moods and increased productiveness when joining marching band. Olchena's studies have also shown that when and introvert joins marching band, they become more social, and those around them report and increase in socializing. Now here's where this relates to every extra curricular, Olchena had his friend, and fellow psychologist, Dr. Alan Russell study this in his area of study, debate team, and the exact opposite is true for this extra curricular. Introverts tend to lose productiveness and have a decrease in happiness, whereas extroverts tend to have increased productiveness and mood.\n \n Drum line, however, is where the studies get interesting. Dr. Brock Hayman, an expert in the effects of drum line on the adolescent brain, has discovered a new area of the brain that awakens the second you join drum line. This area is called the DrumbolowÂ Cortex. When activated, this area of the brain never turns off. The DrumbolowÂ Cortex does some weird things to the brain once activated, it can cause the person to do crazy things, such as picking up gum on the ground of the parking lot at band camp(This has actually happened before.) Other signs that this area has been activated are: inability to stop drumming, addiction to buying drumsticks, need to move up rankings in drumlins, and recruiting more people for the drum line. studies show that 90% of people do not even have this area in their brain, and fewer than 5% of the population has it activated.\n \n These are all good reasons why you should join an extracurricular(*cough cough drum lineÂ cough cough*,) so why shouldn't it be a requirement? Dr. Brett Staudt, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on people's actions around family members, has the answer to your question. \"\"Those who chose to join marching band will become a disturbance to their family, they will become obsessed with showing their family shows by Drum Corps International, such as the Cavaliers 2011 show in which the drums are upside down. Most of the population does not care whatsoever about how amazingly cool it is to drum upside down, but any person who chooses to join marching band, even if they don't do drum line, will become obsessed with the fact that people have enough skill to play the tenors upside down.\"\" This quote says two things, you should watch the Cavaliers 2011 show, and also that marching band has negative effects on the life of family members of the person who chooses this curse/blessing of an activity, not to mention, you'll never see that person again because they'll always be at practice or hanging out with their marching band friends.\n \n Although I do believe it is a good idea to do an extra curricular, Dr. Nathan Strain has done countless studies on forcing adolescents to partake in things, and it causes them to be less interested in what they're doing. I would rather not have people in marching band who are there only because they've been forced to be there, as they will not work as hard because all they care about is the fact that they have to do it. When students have free will and the ability to make their own decision, they will choose what they feel is best for them selfÂ and we should let them do whatever they believe is best for their situation in life at the moment. You never know what else a student has to do at home just to have enough money for food, or to pay for other expenses.\n \n What I take away from this evidence is that we should not force students to participate in extra curricular, but rather encourage them to do so. Personally, joining drum line was the best choice(I'm kidding it was a mistake but I'm glad I made it) I've ever made and I will continue doing drum line for the rest of my high school and college career, although had I been forced, I'm not sure if I'd be as happy to be in it. I genuinely think forcing students to do anything will cause burnout and decrease happiness. I truly think students should make their own decision on if an extra curricular fits in their life or not.

        "There are many different types of people at school. There are athletes, creative, hard-working, and many others. If they were told that they had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school, I think there would be multiple opinions about it. I think that students should not be forced into doing a school activity for three reasons. Their time, their effort, and their stress.\n \n The first reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples time/schedule. If someone for example, would choose sports and the sports practices were after after school. If they didn't have the time to practice from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. or couldn't practice form 5:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. then it would be a pretty rough schedule. Another example is when I was playing basketball for my Middle School team. We had practice everyday and it was very tiring. Some people might just want to go home and sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv instead of doing a activity. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of time.\n \n The second reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples effort. Some people might not like any of the options that the school offers so they might not put all their effort into whatever activity they pick. For example, if a very creative and artistic person looks at all of the options and they are all sport related they will not really care what they pick because that is not what they really like to do. Another example is when my cousins and I went to a arts and crafts place where you could build or draw anything you could imagine. I didn't put as much effort as some as my cousins because arts and crafts is not mt favorite thing to do. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of effort.\n \n Lastly, I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of stress. Some people can get stressed out very easily when they have to do something new or there is a lot to do. For example, if someone was taking all of the most advanced classes you could take and then they had to choose something else to worry about could make a lot of stress. They would have a lot because of how much stuff they would have to worry about. Another example is when I was playing basketball and trying to study for 3 tests I had the next day. It was a lot of stress and made me get headaches because I was focused on too much. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of stress.\n \n I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of three reasons. Their time and how it can make your schedule crazy. Their effort and how much a person likes the options or not. And lastly their stress and how it can make your life have to much to handle.Â Â",

        'GOALLLLLL!!!!\n \n Whether it\'s playing sports, participating in student council, school plays, or just painting in art club, all teens and students need that extra confidence, and adrenaline boost that extracurricular activities provide. Principle of Generic_School, Generic_Name, is proposing a new, controversial school rule that states, ""All students at BRMS\n \n must participate in at least one extracurricular activity throughoutÂ the year."" Should his rule be enforced or shot down? If you were to compare the pros and cons, the answer is yes! Not only will this rule be beneficial to all of the students physical and mental health, but forcing kids to branch out and do extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person.\n \n The first reason why . Generic_Name\'s rule should be enforced is pretty clear. By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not have signed up for on their own, they are forced out of their shell and meet new people who share similar passions. In a pole taken at Southern Utah Middle School, the students were asked approximately how many friends they had and generally how they met. The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, and etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don\'t only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that\'s 7 out of 10! Forming bonds with new people can help with trust and relationship issues and can all be done through simply being forced to branch out and participate in an extracurricular activity at your school.\n \n Another meaningful reason for the students to be forced to enjoy extracurricular activities is because of their mental and physical health. World renown author of several New YorkÂ Times awarded self-help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Steigerwald explains, ""Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too."" Steigerwald is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Engstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. He remembered, ""I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,"" he shuddered, ""Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind."" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after schoolÂ on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle.\n \n Having a clear head spaceÂ has been proven to help with academics, and participating in extracurricular activities has proven to help clear your mind. In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. GPAs in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schoolsÂ around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, ""Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and everyday the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it\'s vital for these college students."" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial.\n \n Although it\'s pretty clear that Generic_Name\'s rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take SOLs and other tests. Do SOLs make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and ""pursuing happiness"" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, ""being happy"". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather then loners, who study, work, and textÂ by themselves. This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier.\n \n In the end, the rule should be passed and all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It will not only be beneficial for their mental health, happiness, and social life, but also for academics and physical activity.Â',

        "If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities can help students with things like building new and helpful experiences, preparing for the future, discovering more about their interests, and socializing with their peers.\n \n Joining a certain group for an extracurricular activity can help you make experiences that can open up different pathways for you in the future. If you ever wanted to pursue a career in a certain field, extracurricular activities that you participate in now can help you prepare for what those might be. For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in a job like graphic design, it could be helpful to join an art club or even yearbook club. When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in. Yearbook club, for example, allows you to design a cover for the school yearbook, which would in turn give you the experience of designing covers. A poll performed by Oxford University has showed that 76% of people who now have jobs in the art field participated in some kind of extracurricular activity at school when they were students to help them learn more about what their future jobs would be like. It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college. Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom. The more activities that you participate in both inside and outside of school, the more qualified you are to go to certain colleges because of your strengths. It helps prepare you for different paths in the future. Participating in extracurricular activities such as clubs and teams can not only help you build experiences for the future, but it can also help you discover what you're passionate about.\n \n If you decided to join in on an activity that you can participate in as an extracurricular, it might help you discover what you enjoy doing.Â At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.\n \n Participating in things like clubs, sports teams, or student council gives students the opportunity to meet new people and branch out.Â When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others. This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people. Most activities like these use team efforts. For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills. Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers. You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities. The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy. Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are. Teammates have to cooperate with each otherÂ and work together in order to accomplish tasks. This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime.Â This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars .\n \n For the reasons that I have provided as well as other ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's encouraged that more students participate in extracurricular activities. There are clearly many ways that it would help improve students' lives. It can help them with their passions, socializing with people who share interests or views, and can help students with making new experiences to assist them in the future. Many schools offer a variety of different activities to join that many of the students already find to be enjoyable. Because of the points made, if my principal ever decided that all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with her decision.",

        "Should all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity? Here are some things that might be helpful to get an answer. Some students might have other work to do from school, students may have other activities after schoolÂ or outside of school, and students might become more stressed from extracurricular activities. Those are some things that might be helpful to answer if students must participate in an extracurricular activity.\n \n First, Students might have other work from school that they have to finish at home or after school. Students might have homework, missing work, or late assignments from school that need to be completed on their own time. If students are not able to finish a certain assignment because of an extracurricular activity, it could possibly lower the students grade. If there is an extra class in school, students will most likely have more homework at the end of the day. Students need to finish other work outside of school.\n \n Second, Students may have other activities after schoolÂ or outside of school. Some students need to stay after school to retake a test, do late or missing work, or even just get extra help from a teacher. Students also need time outside of school to collect community service hours to graduate from high school. Students may have school or non-school related classes at home that they need to take such as a tutor, church/religion classes, etc. So students may need extra time for after schoolÂ or non-school related activities.\n \n Finally, students might become more stressed from another extracurricular activity. If some students have low grades, adding an extracurricular activity might overwhelm the student or stress him or her out. If students have a lot of work to complete, they might rush through everything instead of taking their time and being careful. And lastly, students might not be able to keep up with the extra class or work and their parents might keep pushing them on which will again, stress the student out. So students might become more stressed with an extracurricular activity.\n \n So should students really have to participate in an extracurricular activity? I have come to a conclusion. I disagree because students might have other work from school to do at home, students may have other activities outside of school, and students might become more stressed. Those are the three main reasons why I disagree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity.",

It may also give the kids a chance to stay active instead of going home and just going on there phones. They can help the school with extra stuff like help making the yearbook. This also can make a student get creative if they want to make there own after school club.\n \n The reason kids have a chance to find there passion is because of the choices that the schools has. If the kid is athletic then the school must have all the sports as a choice and the kid can choice what he likes and if his first pick isnt his favorite he can just choose another sport until he finds the one he likes. Then once he likes it he can join a actual team and get good at it. Or if the school has a actual team for that sport he can tryout and see if he makes the team. If the student likes art they can go the a art class and either work on there art or try to get better and try new art techniques. If the student is into acting or something like that they can do drama class and act in plays and practice there acting skills.\n \n Another reason why i think this is good is because it can keep the kids busy instead of them going home to play on there phones. The students can help the teachers with makingÂ yearbooks andÂ if they are good enough they can also take some pictures of the clubs.

On the other hand, a bad one can make a student want to quit liking the activity and do something else. My principal decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with making students participate in an extracurricular activity because of time, money, and a negative impact on everyone.\n \n The first reason is time. Some students might not have enough time to do an extracurricular activity, which could cause the student to have stress. The teacher might lose passion for what they are teaching because of more students, who are being forced to take an extracurricular activity against their will, coming to their after school activity. If the teacher didn't get an influx of students who were forced to take his class, then the they would not have been worn out as fast, or even at all. This will, over time, slowly wear down the teacher, making the class less enjoyable for everyone. Overall, time will be a large problem with forcing students to do extracurricular activities.\n \n The second reason is money. With more students participating, more supplies need to be bought. There might not be enoughÂ money to pay for all of the things students do in an after school activity. The students might not be able to go on trips because they cost to much. People would also be very unhappy if they have to pay for extracurricular activities that their kid was forced into. In the end, there might not be enough money to pay for all of the extracurricular activities.\n \n The final reason is the negative impact it can have on everyone. The teachers will be very stressed becauseÂ they have many students who don't care about that activity. The students will also have plenty of tension because they now have to stay at school longer, and manage another activity every day. If the students are stressed, the effect is that their grades will drop. In all, it can cause everyone to have more unneeded tension.\n \n In conclusion, I don't think making students participate in an extracurricular activity is a great idea. It could help students become more social, but it can cause more problems than it solves. It wouldn't be good if the students or teachers were unhappy because of the principal making students participate in after school activities. I believe extracurricular activities are used to show students new activities and have fun.",

        "Extracurricular Activities Shouldn't Be Forced\n \n Have you ever been forced to do something you didnt want to do? Did you do the task happily? Most people would say it was not an enjoyable experience. When talking about the topic of extracurricular activities in schools, it is definitely something that shouldn't be mandatory. These things shouldn't be forced because it will result in unhappy and resentful students. Also, students should be able to choose their hobbies, and it is frankly none of the school's business.\n \n If we force students to participate in a list of activities that may not cater to their interests, it is only going to make unhappy students who don't actually put any effort into the thing they are being forced to do. Again, try and think back to a time when you were made to do something you didnt want to do. Something that took time away from things you actually wanted, or even needed to do. You probably didn't do that thing with a whole lot of thought and effort, or at least you didn't do it in a good mood. What's the point of forcing kids to do activities, if they are just going to do it sloppily, with zero effort. No matter how many options a school provides, there will always be kids who don't like any of them.\n \n Even though they may not like any of the options at school, whose to say they don't enjoy something outside of school. For example, what if a student is really passionate about their art? And between their chores and school work, they only get work on it about an hour of their day. Now, because they are forced to play a sport or join a club, they have absolutely no time to work on what brings them joy. This defeats the whole purpose of an extracurricular activity.\n \n Even if everyone was perfectly happy with the activity they have to do, why is it any of the schools business what people do with their free time? A school's job is to give students a safe place to learn, and to provide optional extracurricular activities. It's not a schools job to control so much of a students life, that it's even taking up time outside of school. Schools have no idea what goes on in a student's life, and it is unfair for them to assume everyone just has the time and want to do an additional thing outside of school. If a student wants to participate in something, they will. There is no need to force people to do things they dont want to do.\n \n As you can see, the idea of making an extracurricular activity mandatory has many downsides. So many that it is obviously it is not a good idea. Making people do things they don't want to do has never turned out good. Students need the freedom to make their own choices, and the school should have nothing to do with that. No matter how many benefits, extracurricular activities should never be mandatory.Â",

        "Even though a lot of school aged kids participate in after school activities, there are still a lot who don't. Some of them don't participate because theres nothing they like. There are also some kids that act like since they arent forced to do the activities then they won't ever do them, which may set them back in life. Most activities can be so fun, exciting, and interesting. In addition, there are a lot of benefits to participating in such activities, they keep you active and healthy, makes interact with others, and they can keep you busy. So if the principal was to make kids participate in one after school activity that would be a great and wonderful idea.\n \n People who commit to an activity of some sort can stay active and have a healthier mindset compared to a person who doesnt participate. For example, if you sign up for volleyball club after school after the principal made the announcement that you have too. You now not only have a way to exercise but also an activity to help take your mind off everything else. Even if you sign up for a learning club or activity, like a \"\"teaching you how to eat healthy club\"\", can impact your life. But you can get healthier after participating in a club or activity. If your going through a rough time then for some people a good thing would for you to do something other than mope around about it. You can developÂ good sportsmanshipÂ and other great qualities of a person. In other words many good influences can come off of having to do an activity.\n \n Interaction with other people is almost a given when participating in any sort of activity. Human interaction is a huge part of everything in our world. But so many people today have a hard time with it for many different reasons. So if you start at a younger age, trying to get better to interact with people, you'll get set for the rest of your life. As you interact and talk to people you learn a lot. You developÂ a sense of great team work and friendship. So many friendships are started when you start talking to people at these actives. You'll feel not alone and a great friend can rub off some good traits, making you a better person. In conclusion, interaction is great to do and going to these activities will help you interact with people.\n \n Activities make you stay busy, and take up your time in a good way. People who don't participate in activities will get bored easily and often. While someone who does participate in one will have a lot more to do. For example, if you participate in a spring lacrosse league and on a random Sunday you get bored you can practice lacrosse in your backyard. Another example might be if you participate in boy scouts or girl scouts you may have homework to do before your next meeting. But all a person has that doesn't participate in any activities is sitting on their bed or a couch on their phones. Then every hour theyll think to themselves how bored they are. Participating in activities gets you busy and not as bored as often.\n \n Making kids participate in any activity, or sport is a great idea. Why? Well because great benefits come from participating in activities like keeping you active, interacting with others, and keeping you busy. Whatever you do whether its a club, sport, or just a plain activity of some sort, many opportunities can show up for you. A new passion developed can introduce a job oppritunity or hobby. Doing activities is a wonderful experience that you have to do yourself. Even if you might not completely like what youre doing at first. Who knows maybe you'll find your new passion and hobby.

Does your parent ever said, \"\"You play on your phone 24/7!\"\" Students should get involve in at least one extracurricular activity at school because students can makes new friends, they get to experience new things that they never done before, and help students express them self to others. Students can choose up to 25 different activities to do after school like sports, art, clean the school, and a lots more different activities. This help students get involve with their school.\n \n When students is participating the extracurricular activities, they can make new friends. When making new friends, they are introducing them self to other students. This can improves their communication and social skills with other, good communication can also help students when they are in school or in the outside world. Additionally, they also get to a better understanding of the other students personality.

But luckily you are saved by playing you favorite sport, or you like going round the school taking pictures for a yearbook, you could even be reading your favorite book with your friends in a book club. I believe that students should be allowed to do at least one extracurricular activity of there choice. Because it relieves stress and make students look forward to school, can also be good for the school, and help student figure out what they want to do after they are done with school.\n \n I think that these school activities are good because the student can use these activities as a way to relieve stress by reading. These groups can also include counseling if the student has any problems outside or inside of school. lastly students can use these activities to learn about what they and other student want to learn, for example if the student wanted to learn photography he/she would be allowed to take pictures of flowers or animals. This is why I believe that students can relieve stress from school or from family.\n \n Another that we should allow these activities is that they not only benefit the students but can also benefit the school.\n \n this is because the student can make a club that every week they pick a random teacher and show her/him appreciation for helping us learn. Another thing a students can do is create posters for the school sports team. And they could help put together a school yearbook. This is how these activities will also help the school out.\n \n lastly I think that this could be very helpful for the student and allow them to explore what they want to do. We can do this buy creating activities that can show the students hands on experience of the jobs they can do in the future. for example we could show the how to do there taxes or how to sign up for a credit card. I do personally believe this is a very important thing that we could show the students so they learn early on how to deal with life.\n \n This is why I agree that student should take a extracurricular activities of there choice because it helps with many things. Such as relieving stress and making students happy. Can also help out the teachers and the school.

        "There are a lot of students that like to stay after school for extracurricular activities . Other students go home and don't even stay after school at all. I strongly disagree that students should not participate in a extracurricular activity if they don't want to. Some students have responsibilities at home for example. Taking care of a younger sibling, cleaning the house, helping their parents out, etc... but on the other hand if students are going home to play video games,not interacting with other people in the outside world then they should,becauseÂ they can't be inside all day they need some fresh air and interact with other human beings.\n \n But heres the thing students already have school for about 7-8 hours half of the time either listening to the teacher or taking a test so obviously they leave school tried and exhausted.\n \n Many students don't even like coming to school and still show up I think if the principal forced students to join a extracurricular activity the percentage of students skipping will increase and students might not even show up to school.\n \n We also have to think about the teachers ,you are obviously going to need a teacher to stay with the student for whatever curricular activity they get assigned to but believe it or not teachers have a life outside of school.

        "Countless students follow the same after-school routine. After a long day at school, they joyfully return home with a smile on their face. That happiness is because while they were forced to learn and work at school, there are no expectations like that at home. As the sun rises and sets, they have the freedom to mindlessly waste the rest of the day away. That's why rather than spending time outdoors, focusing on hobbies, or spending time with friends and family, students just lock themselves into their rooms. Then, they proceed to pull out their electronics and play away until the end of the day. It's an extremely unhealthy yet addictive lifestyle. But, that lifestyle could change if students had an after-school activity to attend. They would start spending more attention to what's outside of the virtual world. Thus, it is my firm belief that every student should be required to participate in an least one extracurricular activity because it will increase student productivity, improve students' social skills, and promote student engagement.\n \n If an extracurricular activity became a requirement, students would have a more beneficial activity to attend after-school. Every day, when school comes to an end, many students find themselves with hours and hours of free time. However, they end up accomplishing nothing because they have no tasks to complete and no activities to participate in. So, they turn to their main source of entertainment- electronics. And while students are fortunate enough to have the entire day to spend on their phones and computers, no good comes out of it. That's why extracurricular activities are necessary. Students may resent it at first, but in the long run it will create significant improvements to their lifestyle. Students could spend their free timeÂ on activities more worthwhile. They could be winning a soccer championship or fund raisingÂ for those in need. The entire world is there for students to explore and discover. All students need is a small push in the right direction.\n \n Furthermore, extracurricular activities also give students opportunities to interact with their peers. It can be intimidating for students when they have to join a group of complete strangers. However, although it is nerve-wracking, students have the wonderful opportunity to make new friends. Their team will contain people of a similar age group and perhaps similar interests. Besides, with how frequent meetings are, members will be spending an abundance of time together; they're guaranteed to form new friendships. On the contrary, extracurricular activities also help maintain current friendships. It can be difficult to meet up with friends out of school, so joining an extracurricular activity allows students to get together more often. All in all, as it goes with any team, members form a tight bond with one another. By the end of the year, they'll be surprised by the amount of new friends they've made.\n \n Lastly, extracurricular activities promote students' engagement with their community. Students rarely ever have an opportunity to venture beyond their small school environment, which consequently limits the amount of change they're able to make. However, with extracurricular activities, students will have more opportunities to make an impact on their community. For example, being a part of the student council gives you many opportunities to make a difference. Members raise awareness of issues, fund raiseÂ for the needy, and even more. Being active in a team like that motivates students. With all they accomplish, they being to feel much more productive and hence acquire a sense of belonging. That results in students truly believing they can make a difference in the world, which then causes them to become more engaged and active in their community.\n \n It's common knowledge that extracurricular activities are extremely beneficial, yet many students still hesitate from participating and consequently miss out on amazing opportunities. Extracurricular activities have a much larger role than just providing entertainment. They allow students to become more productive, social, and active in their community. We can't allow students to miss out on a chance to build those skills. The experiences they obtain from the extracurricular activities will stick with them for life. Therefore, if participating becomes a requirement, our world will become a much better place. Students may have their doubts about extracurricular activities, but they will truly be tremendously changed by them. The requirement of extracurricular activities will allow our world to raise much healthier and productive generations. With just a simple requirement, the future of our society will look much brighter.Â  Â",

When kids are young it is hard to diagnoseÂ Asthma. If these kids were on a school sports team and had an Asthma attack there would be no way to help them because if they were never diagnosed with Asthma, they won't have an inhalerÂ to help them. This whole incident would have never happened if the Mrs. Jones hadn't required students to participate in one extracurricular activity.\n \n Students shouldn't be forced to participate in activities they don't want to participate in.

What is an extracurricular activity, and why did my principal make this decision? Figuring out the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, and how they impactthe students, will help me conclude how I feel about this choice.\n \n What are extracurricular activities? These activities are something a student could participate in to entertain or captivate them. Examples of these activities could be an art class, sports, or even a chess club. Normally, these activities are something you personally enjoy, or have a passion for. They could be in school, after school, or maybe not in school at all. One way how most schools get you to take an extracurricular activity, is by offering electives. Most schools have electives as a fun class for students, or something they enjoy learning. Another reason schools might have electives, is for the mind to grow, and find fun in certain activities. Not everyone has the same passion, so there are many options. You don't necessarily need to be good at an extracurricular activity, you just have to love, or have fun doing it.\n \n What is the reasoning behind the principalÂ forcing the students to take at least one activity? Cellphones are one of the main entertainment for teenagers, them often spending many hours a day on them. Even if you enjoy using your device, it is not the type of passion most adults would choose. Making students do an extracurricular activity might positivelyÂ give them a push to try new things. Taking an in or out of school activity may expand the students outlook on electives or clubs the school offers, and alluding for them to try something new. Going to these clubs or activities, offers new friendships as well. Other people that take the same activity as you, may also share the same passion. It is easier to connect with people who are similar to you. The principal would want the best for their school, and by making the students take an activity, they get new educational experiences.\n \n Even though these activities can have a positive effect on the students, there can also be negatives. Some students don't care about finding a passion, or an activity for them to do. They might just want to take a class that gives them an \"\"easy a\"\", not because it's something they would actually do for fun. Not only that, but some students just try to get into a class with their friend. That friend might be taking a class that doesn't interest the student. Taking a subject or activity that is boring or uninteresting to you, won't help you find what you like to do. When forcing the students to take an activity, while it might help them find their interests and explore new things, it might also force them to do unwanted subjects that don't please them.\n \n In conclusion to this prompt, I agree with the decision of the principal to make all students take an extracurricular activity. Forcing the students to take an extracurricular activity, can effect them greatly. It offers them experiences, finding what they like to do best, and discovering what they are good at. It can expand their communication with other people, and overall, make new friends. These activities, depending on what they are, can be good for your health. Some students don't particularly care about finding what they like to do, and would rather just be with their friends or use their cellular device. Making these students take an extracurricular activity, can make them discover new things that they didn't know or realize before.",

        "Have you ever tried an in-school sport or club? Many students enjoy extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. But some students aren't as keen on the idea. Some think it's a waste of time, or that they're very boring. But extracurricular activities help students and schools in many different ways. I think students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity because the students will learn new skills, students will become more social, and the school will become more diverse in it's interests.\n \n There are many skills to be learned in extracurricular activities. Depending on what activity it is, you can be taught a wide variety of talents. After school sports will teach you the basics to the game, and then maybe you'll make it to the school team for that sport. Certain clubs will teach students other games and talents. At my old school, there was a huge chess club. Some of the kids that went to it every Wednesday didn't even know how to play at first. Then they learned, as any other student could if they attended a mandatory extracurricular activity. Some clubs can even teach students the basics of just being a good student or friend, like the homework club, or the diversity club. So if every student took a mandatory extracurricular activity, everyone would learn a lot.\n \n Students can become more social through extracurricular activities. The more students spend time with people with similar interests, the more friends they'll make. If a student was to only hangout with the same group of friends all year, he or she would never become more social, which is a good skill to have as you get older. Besides, a student might make a life long friend through an extracurricular activity. Even if a student doesn't make any new friends through extracurricular activities, they'll still have learned important communication and social skills.\n \n If a school has a large variety of extracurricular activities that every student is attending at least one, the school will become more diverse in the student's intersests. Diversity in a school is very important for many reasons. Diversity would look good on how the rest of the county views the school. Then they might follow suite and make extracurricular activities mandatory. Another reason why diversity in a school is important because the students will impact each other and make each other want to try more activities, making a postitive cycle in which students want to partcipate in extracurricular activities, therefore benefiting them in the other ways, social and skill benefits.\n \n In all, mandatory extracurricular activities will help our school system in plenty of ways. They'll teach students skills, make students more social, and make the school more diverse. These are just some of the reasons that schools need mandatory extracurricular activities. If you want madatory extracurricular activities at your school, start a petitionfor your principal to see. Even if that doesn't work, you can always just convince your friends and classmates to go to these extracurricular activities. This is why I believe schools should have mandatory extracurricular activities.",

        "Have you ever wondered about the benefits of students participating in an activity? Extracurricular activities can have many things to it. Some activities can be sports,yearbook designing,student council, and many other things that students can enjoy. Students would have a great time and enjoy these types of things and can find different kinds of activities they could participate in. All students should participate in an activity because it can help students find an interest,students can enjoy it, and can help keep their minds distracted from school.\n \n Students can find different activities to find an interest/hobby. Students who don't usually participate in activities or events can find something new if they are being told to do something. Hence, making a student find an activity means that they will be searching to find one, and will lead to finding an activity they find interesting and try it out. In other words, students who doodle once in a while might find an art related activity and join. In addition, this can also help them keep an open mind and not think that all or some activities are boring or considering them as something they would never like doing. Some students might also be shy or not be involved to much in things so they might want to join an activity but are to scared to participate. This means that when students must pick an activity they can feel relieved and happy to do so.\n \n Some students can enjoy having extracurricular activities. For example, student would enjoy having activities because they can be able to do something that they enjoy instead of having class. To add to this, students that are athletic wouldn't be able to play a sport during class because it isn't allowed and would be very disruptive. Therefore, when students are allowed to choose an activity that would make them joyful and excited to join the one they connect with the most. This will also be beneficial to the class/classes that a person is in because they have already done what they wanted during their activity and it can help them focus in their classes more efficiently.\n \n The minds of students can be distracted from school related things. Students nowadays can become stressed, and can cause their brain to be less efficient. Students can be feeling down and even depressed which is a very bad situation for students since they have lots of things piled on them. Some of these things would include projects,homework, essays, and other things that can be personal to that student. Therefore, by joiningÂ an activity students can relieve their mind off certain topics and think about other things. While in an extracurricular activity they can communicate with others and can find new friends too. In addition, they can also find an activity that can help them relax and be more calm. For example, a meditation club (activity) would be very helpful or an art activity so they can draw out their emotion/feelings.\n \n Overall, students should all participate in activities. This is because it can be appealing to some students and not so appealing to others, but this can make them find different activities/opportunities and keep them open minded. Students can also find new friendships and can be distracted from school related things which keeps their minds functioning. Extracurricular activities include lots of different things and students can enjoy it and consider participating in one or more activities. Students should all join an activity because it helps them clear their minds,some students enjoy activities, and it can help students find an interest/hobby. Â Â Â",

        "A tiresome day of school just ended, but instead of being exhausted, you are exited because your extracurricular activity is about to start. Many students go to school everyday, then leave on the bus, or walk home, until returning the next day. Because a lot of students do that, the majority of them never experience any clubs that the schools works hard to put together. By making students try out a club, they would appreciate what the school has to offer. Principals should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help students be active in the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students explore some of their interests for the future.\n \n One reason that a school's principal should require students to have to participate in at least one activity after schoolÂ is so that students become active in the school once the hours of school are done. Students who stay after schoolÂ for an extracurricular activity participate in some of the schools programs. This leaves a stronger connection from the students to the school. Students can choose out of many clubs offered, and thereforeÂ feel as if they found a bigger reason to stay in school. A reason that students should be required to participate in an after schoolÂ activity is so they are more active in the school.\n \n Another reason that school principal should make kids participate in an after schoolÂ club is so that kids can interact better with others. When students join a club in school, they meet new kids, ones with similar interests as them. Because of their shared interests, students can form a bond, all because of this club. Kids would also talk with the teachers running each club activity because they have more in common, like a passion for the club. A second reason that kids should have to participate in a extracurricular activity at school is so they learn to interact better with both students and teachers.\n \n Lastly, if a school principal made students join an after schoolÂ club, students would find and explore some of their interests. Students all have their own interests and hobbies, but to find them, one would have to look. Middle and high school students are at the perfect age to explore passions because they are getting ready to pick a major in college, so they are looking high and low for an idea of what their major will be. By joining a club at your school, students will find some club that pulls at them, inviting them to join. Also, students would have time after schoolÂ to try new clubs or sports. For example, an interested student could choose to participate in the yearbook committee, or even the SCA. One last reason that students should participate in an after school club is because they can figure out some of their hobbies and passions before college.\n \n In Conclusion, if a school principal required that all students must participate in some after school club, students would become more active around the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students expand their hobbies. A student would have a bigger purpose to stay at school if they had to join a club, giving them a stronger connection to the school. The interactions between students and teachers would be higher because they would have more in common. Finally, students would explore many different career paths for college and have a varied set of interests when participating in after school clubs. Principals, by making your students participate in an extracurricular activity, you help students in a lot of ways, so consider trying out this idea for a better future for your students.Â",

        "Do you agree or disagree, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I disagree with this decision because, students may be uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on student council. Some students may not have the transportation from school after they are finished with the activity. Also, some students may have important things to do at home everyday after school.\n \n Students may be uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. These activities may not be easy for him or her to do. These activities may not be his or her thing. Some may never picture themselves doing these kind of activities. Some students may be interested in doing a different activity.

Some parents may be at work, and can't pick them up. The student's coach or another student's parent may not feel like or cant take the student home.

Also, they may need to get rest for a different activity outside of school.\n \n The principal should rethink about this idea, because some students have reasons why they can't participate in his or her school extracurricular activities. Such as, students being uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. No transportation from school, after they are done with the activity. Also, some students have important things to do at home after school. This decision is not a good idea for the students. Let students make their own decisions about what they would like to do!

        "Regarding the decisionÂ the Principal made, (\"\"all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity\"\")\n \n I agree with for the following reasons.\n \n The first reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will improve social life for many students at our school.\n \n Social Life is very important for kids my age because, it helps build character, (which means, it builds up personalityÂ and special traits within a certain student) creates new friendships, (always a good thing to have) and it will also make the student feel like they're a part of something.\n \n Another reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will also help students who are dealing with personal stress. As everyone knows, a lot of kids my age suffer from different types of stress. Which are mostly caused by either depression, anxiety or even loneliness. Which means that with this new opportunity they have, their depression, anxiety, and loneliness might go down a bit as they get to interact with other students while they participate in activities they might of never even tried before.\n \n The final reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will even help students develop time management skills. Most students at our school (that I know of) either don't have time or don't know how to fit everyday activities like school, homework, and free time in their everyday lives. So, since they have to participate in something new now, it might open up their eyes a bit and help them see how to distribute their time, which will result in them having some free time at the end of the day.\n \n In conclusion, I think the Principal's decision to make students attend or take an extracurricular activity is a great idea because, it improves social life, lowers stress some students might have, and also helps students develop time management skills.",

        "Students should not have to participate in activities because some students might not have any interests in the activities the school provides them with. Teachers, and parents always tell me \"\"school comes first\"\", but the principal is more worried if a student makes practice on time. Now cm not saying activities are bad for students, but why does every student have to participate when they should be more worried about their future. Kids are more worried about missing their clubs than missing the notes that the teacher is providing before the test. Students should not participate in activities because some kids might not have any interests, kids should be more worried about their education than their clubs, and last but not least, kids are missing missing the notes that the teachers provide for the kids so they can pass their test.\n \n Not only does this situation affects students, but it also affects teachers and parents. Most teacher are anxious for kids because they have doubt that the students will not pass their assignments or even their class. Parents are terrified of the school calling them because their kid is not passing. Getting an education should be a kid's top priority because not one dream will be possible without an education. This situation can affect teachers and parents because they both get anxious when their kids are not passing a class, A kid's top priority should be getting an education.\n \n School activities are good when students are still doing good in school. activities should not be in frontÂ of education but kids will put it there when teachers are forcing students to take an extracurricular course. Most students only want to learn when they walk into school. But they are being forced to join an activity that has no relevancy. School activities are good when kids are passing, a kids education should always be first, being forced to join an activity is not right.\n \n When I was 13 years old in seventh grade, I was on a basketball team. When I walked into practice my coach called me in to talk about my grades and why I was failing, he didn't care about what I had to say so he cut me from the team. When I walked home my anxiety level went through the roof because I was trying to find a way to bring up my grades before the school year ends. When I told my parents what happened they started panicking and hitting and told me it was way too late to bring my grades up and I might fail. My body felt cold and I was depressed, I begged my teachers for help everyday but they told me that it still would not bring all of my grades up. Because I didn't care about my school work I had bad grades, I had anxiety, and last knowing I couldn't do nothing to bring my grades up gave me depression.\n \n Students should not have to participate in school activities because most kids might not have interests in them. activities can affect a kids grades which can have teachers and parents worried. Kids will put their activity as their top priority when getting their education should be. Students, and the school staff should be more productive with students education.

        "Neville Longbottem transformed from a blundering idiot to the hero who destroyed Voldemort's most precious Horcurx. How did he do this? Through extracurriculars, which are also extremely important for students in the real world. I agree with my principal that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities encourage students to become more confident and brings to light their hidden qualities, while also giving them skills that will be useful throughout their whole life. Students can also discover their passion through extracurriculars, which could eventually become their life's work.\n \n Extracurricular activities instills confidence in a person and helps them show others their best qualities. If we dig deep into Neville Longbottom's school life, we discover that everything changed after he joined Dumbledore's Army, a club founded by Harry Potter to encourage the learning of Defense Against the Dark Arts. He gained confidence while he took over the club for Harry, and his true qualities of bravery and courage really shined through. Confidence is important because studies have proven that a person who is clearly confident is more respected by their peers. Possessing confidence helps a person to have good mental health as well and boosts up happiness levels by at least 80%. It is also important for a person to show others who they truly are, because hiding their true qualities creates feelings of dissatisfaction, which is overall detrimental towards a person's happiness. Helping students open up and gain confidence are just one of the several benefits that extracurriculars provide.\n \n Students gain necessary life skills as well as confidence through extracurriculars. These life skills are often skills that can only be acquired through experience. Social skills such as leadership can definitely be acquired, and it is a coveted skill that can eventually lead to success. Just look at Neville! Proof that leaders are made, not born. Students also learn the importance of commitment as well as the skill of cooperation through extracurriculars like sports. In Quidditch, a sport that requires a ton of commitment and cooperation, Harry Potter learned to drag himself out of bed at the crack of dawn and deal with foul opponents, something which would definitely help him later on in life after he became the Head of the Auror Office. One of the most important skills a person can learn while doing an extracurricular is time management. Most self-made billionaires are masters of time management. Balancing extracurriculars with school is no simple feat, and will definitely prove to be useful in the future.\n \n One of the best things about extracurriculars is that it will help a person find that passion which will fuel their life's work. By exploring different clubs and activities, a person can discover what it is that truly ignites fire in their soul. In a recent poll, 87% of the people who have a passion state that they are at least 95% happy about where their life is going. These are incredible numbers compared to the 97% of people who don't have a passion who state that they are less than 30% happy about where their life is going. Another poll has stated that less than an estimated 50% of people do not enjoy going to work. This is because they are not passionate about it. A person who hates their work will not be happy at all, which could result in early health complications. For students in particular, finding a passion is important because colleges are more favorable upon students who have a passion versus those who don't. Having a passion is necessary for happiness, and extracurriculars will help students find their passion.\n \n I strongly believe that extracurriculars are necessary. They help students gain confidence and a passion and teaches important life skills. Most importantly, they make students happy. Neville Longbottom, the former laughingstock of Hogwarts, transformed himself through an extracurricular. Even though Neville is fictional, he proves the importance of extracurriculars, and shows exactly why every student should participate in at least one.Â",

        "Whether it's a lovable hobby of yours or an aspiration, there is always a task a person loves to carry out.\n \n Mandatory extracurricular activities would be a phenomenal addition to the requirements of our school.\n \n I find this decision to be fantastic because it gives the opportunity to students to practice unknown activities and find new passions that drive them forward.\n \n In addition, the school too would benefit from the growing skills and work put out by the students through extracurricular activities.\n \n The first reason why I agree with our school in this decision, is because it will provide the opportunity for both me and my classmates to practice the unknown and find new passions for us to follow.\n \n This practicing of new activities will provide us students a development in our skills.\n \n For instance, if I were to become the head of the student council I would experience how to become a leader, the skills needed to be a leader, and how to drive my classmates to become better students.\n \n Secondly, a new drive or passion for our motivation could become discovered through the practicing of extracurricular activities.\n \n As a result of this finding of new passion or drive, both me and my classmates would be able to figure out what it is we really aspire to be in the future to come.\n \n Finally, the experience that would be provided to us through extracurricular activities, be it sports, leadership roles, or other extracurricular activities that are available to us, would be extremely helpful in our futures.\n \n Specifically, the work ethics that would be highly important in our future in college and even when having a job, these work ethics would be taught like wildfire in any extracurricular activity as long as participation and active engagement is exercised.\n \n The growing passion and drive combined with the learning of skills and work ethics will surely benefit both me and my schoolmates in the future to come.\n \n As for the second reason I support my school's decision, it is due to the fact that my classmates will not be the only to gain through the mandatory extracurricular activities rule, the growing skills along with the hard workÂ that will be progressively demonstrated by the students will surely benefit the school in more ways than one.\n \n A major part of any school, the yearbook, could be made and designed by the people who are inside of the yearbook.\n \n Specifically, the feelings, emotions and bonds created and felt throughout the year by myself and by my schoolmates, could only be expressed inside a yearbook through the people who made those bonds and felt those feelings.\n \n However, that is not the only benefit, the students of the school will also be able to make a more deep and connecting bond through both the teachers and through each other.\n \n For instance, not every club or sports team can run by a teacher or by a student, this diverse teaching environment that will be provided will prove to show a deeper connection through my schoolmates and through their main learning environment.\n \n Lastly, the improvement of attraction to our school will encourage every student to work harder and become better students along with better learners.\n \n In depth, the increased need to work hard and utilize the skills learned through extra curricular activities will increase the grades, performance, and attentiveness of many students in class and outside of class.\n \n All in all, this decision will not only grow myself along with my classmates, but the school in a whole.\n \n The third and final reason why I agree and wholeheartedlyÂ support the decision of my school is because both me and my schoolmates will be able to grow mentally, and physically through the extracurricular activities.\n \n First off, the improvements of the number of people participating in extracurricular activities will prove beneficial for people who are in study groups.\n \n As a result of the increased amount of people taking extracurricular activities, an increased amount of people will join study groups which will allow more sharing of knowledge through older members and newer members.\n \n Secondly, sports teams will be able to have more competition, therefore increasing the skill gap between players.\n \n More people participating in extracurricular activities means more people trying out for sports teams which results in a higher demand to play for the team, whether it be basketball, soccer, football or other sports, the high demand will cause an increase in specific member choosing for the teams and will also cause an increase in team spots, therefore increasing the skill of the teams and creating more ways for myself and other students to play sports and grow ourselves physically through those sports.\n \n Lastly, mental sports teams like chess, Sudoku, and other mental sports, will see the same increase.\n \n Specifically an increase of mental capacity being held by our school's students, and with this increase in mental capacity needed to play games like chess, it causes an increase in schoolwork performance, and other schoolwork related items such as tests and quizzes.\n \n The improvement in mental and physical prowess being presented will surely produce results for my schoolmates in the future to come.\n \n The addition of mandatory extracurricular activities to our school will prove to be a promising and progressive choice.\n \n Firstly, students are going to able to practice unknown activities, find new passions, and find new friends while still growing themselves.\n \n Secondly, these growing skills and hard work that will come to be expressed by both me and my schoolmates will prove beneficial not only for us, but for the school as well.\n \n Finally, students will be able to express their mental and physical growth and increase that mental and physical growth through these extracurricular activities.\n \n I believe without a doubt that the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities is the best decision our school has ever made.Â",

Most parents don't get off work till six o-clock, and lets say your kids practice ends at five o-clock, or maybe even four o-clock, your child would be alone at school for more than an hour, and thats a long time. No child should have to be alone for that long and doing something they don't want to do.\n \n Lastly, if your child has younger siblings and they have to take care of they after school, they wont have time for other activities. Generic_Name is a fourteen year old girl and has a three year old sister named Generic_Name . Every day she comes home and plays with her, feeds her, and gives her everything she needs while mom isÂ at work. If Generic_Name has to stay after school for an activity, what would Generic_Name do? This was the most important reason, kids just don't have time.\n \n In conclusion, we can all agree that students should not be forced to do after school activities, the cost is to much, they may not have a way home and they might hot have time because of younger siblings to take care of. Don't let someone force your kid to do an activity they don't want to do. Next time your at a parents meeting for your kids school and the principle asks for who is against all students being forced to do an extracurricular activity, raise your hand for the sake of you and your loving, passionate kid.Â Â Â",

        "I believe that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The reason I believe this is because students need to know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities, they need to learn how to do other activities, and because many students don't do extracurricular activities. I believe the principal is right in this decision. Doing these activities is an essential in these students lives. These students must start participating in extracurricular activities.\n \n Many students need to know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities. Students need to learn how to do activities, such as playing basketball. Basketball also gives a lot of exercise, which is very important for students. If students start playing games, such as basketball, they will know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities, how to work together, and how to make decisions. I believe that participating in sports such as basketball is very important to students.\n \n Some students may already do extracurricular activities, but it is important to learn how to do other activities. It is important that students learn how to do other activities, not just one activity. If students learned how to do other activities, they can learn many other things. For example, students that work on the school yearbook can learn how to edit. Editing is a very important thing that can help students make things look nicer. It can also teach students to learn how to work together with their peers. Learning how to do other activities is a very important thing.\n \n Even though some students may already participate in these activities, many do not. Some students may play on the computer, watch TV, or even just do nothing. These students need to start trying out some extracurricular activities. If they do not, then they will never learn many of the things these activities teach. Some of these things include working together, decision making, or even learning how to make friends. These things that extracurricular activities teach are very essential in our every day lives. These students need to learn how to do these essential things in their lives.\n \n Students need to participate in extracurricular activities. The reason I support the principals decision is because students need to know how it is like to participate in these activities, they need to learn other activities, and students that don't do these activities need to start trying some out. Many people enjoy these activities. Students need to learn that these activities are good for them and that they teach many important things. I believe that if these students just tried out some of these activities, they would learn to enjoy them.",

Students should take at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future, students will get healthier if they join a sports team, and students will make for friends.\n \n Students should at least take one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future. First, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then students will find the job that they want. For example, when Johnny did multiple activities in school, he knew that he wanted to be an artist because he liked to draw and he was good at it. Also, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then they will make can make lots of money.

        "Imagian getting home from school at around five and then doing homework till like seven or eight sounds crazy right well thats what will happen if students are fourced to do an extracurricular activity. Us students simply wouldn't have time for anything else which is why I disagree with making students dp a curricular activity. Some of us students just don't have the time and are far to busy with things like getting home late, doing homework or studing, plus some kids babysit.\n \n The first reason I disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. Parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. Plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.\n \n The second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. If you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. This will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. Which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.\n \n The third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin. However, with an after school activity they will not return home in time to watch said family members. And lets not forget that some students have jobs as babysitters for other people's kids.\n \n Now I understand that some people may say \"\"oh but it's good for young children to do an after school activity and I agree, however some students are far to busy and should not be fourced to do an after school activity its not that we're lazy or anything we'er just to busy.\n \n so in conclution i believe students should not be fourced into an extracurricular activity some of us are truely to busy for one being that we will get home late, have to much homework, and no time for friends, along with watching younger family members there is no time",

        "I do not agree with this, if students were required to take an extracurricular it may not work for everyone. Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after schoolÂ students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.\n \n Extracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to. The student may feel the need to attend every single meeting which may also cause stress or anxiety. There are two more reasons that an extracurricular activity should not be required.\n \n Students may not like any extracurricular activity that was offered. There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list. If the student does not like any extracurricular activity they should not be forced into one. Forcing a student into an activity they do not want to do could be stressful on them or result in a violent reaction.Â There is a final reason why extracurricular activities should not be required.\n \n Students may not have the time for an extracurricular activity if it is after school. Some students have things going on as soon as they get home, it could be another sport that is not in school or just going out after school. A lot of people usually don't have time for an activity that is after school if they are already in a sport that is not at the school. This could also result in not getting homework done or getting bad grades. The extracurricular activity could easily get in the way of these things a students has to do.\n \n If a extracurricular activity was needed I do not think it should be mandatory. It could cause any of the listed things; stress and anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after schoolÂ students may not have time for it.

        "After-school activities offer a variety of things, and students often choose to stay after school to enjoy them. However, being forced to stay past school hours to participate wouldn't be much fun for something that's supposed to be an activity to enjoy in your free time. Students should not have to participate in after-school activities, because some students may have other matters they need to attend to (family, jobs, etc), may already be doing a time-consuming activityÂ outside of school, or may not have transportation home.\n \n Students may already have things to do that take up after-school time: for example, they could be needed to babysit younger siblings, to take care of another family member, to do household chores, or to work an after-school job. Requiring students to do an after-school activity would take up this time, where they might be really needed.\n \n Having students participate in things beside schoolwork is important, but not more important than family or work needs. They might be leaving a younger child alone, just because they have to participate inÂ a sport or student council. There are things more important than extracurricular activities.\n \n Students may also have an outside-of-school activity to participate in at the time. Many students choose to take lessons or sports outside of school. For example, they might have private instrument lessons, a neighborhood science club, or a sport team that isn't school-involved. These activities are just as important as school ones, and they shouldn't be forced to miss them because of requiring extracurricular clubs. The outside-of-school activities are often paid for, or require money in some way. This would lead to a loss of money for the parents, paying for lessons that the students can't attend.Â Students may lead busy lives, and they shouldn'tÂ have to have them taken up by even more school-required things.\n \n Another reason school clubs shouldnt be enforced is that while buses and parent pick-up are often available at the end of the school day, it is not always the same when it's already been an hour after school. Parents also often have busy schedules, and they can't always be available to drive their student home. That is one reason why some students choose not to participateÂ in extracurricular activities. But ifÂ studentsÂ are being forced to stay after school, they might not have a ride home. This would create a problem, because then most of the school would need a bus ride home, and that would require a lot of buses and bus drivers. This would be very financially taxing for the school, so it would be better to just let students go home at the end of the school day. They have already been required to attend school for seven hours; it would not be fair to make them stay longer for something that isn't even education-related.\n \n In summary, students have busy lives already, taken up by chores, family commitments, possible after-school jobs, schoolwork, and outside-of-school activities. They shouldn't be forced to add more things to their schedule. Extracurricular activities are meant to something fun and enjoyable in a student's free time, a choice to partake in something they find interesting. Making students attend extracurricularÂ activities would take the fun out of it - it's supposed to a chance students can take, not another thing forced upon them. These students have lives to live, things to take care of, other time-consuming responsibilities in life that are more important than school-related ones. Let extracurricular activities remain as a choice for students.",

        "This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.\n \n Most students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.\n \n Students tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.\n \n We all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.\n \n Principals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things about doing a sport after school. You should go out and try for any sport you can and you can get better and better everyday. Nobody is holding you back from doing something you want to try doing.",

Going to school and playing sports like basketball, football and soccer and etc, playing those sports during school hours could be fun for the students. For the ones that love to play sports could have so much fun. Playing the sports you like can be fun but also can make you better at the things you do, it is like giving you practice outside of practicing with your team. Kids now in days need to at least do something active everyday. So therefore kids should at least be active of doing something for at least 60 minutes.

Yearbook is an example of being active and also doing activities. Doing a activity that involves technology can make sure kids can learn things with the things that they are working with in school. Most students prefer using technology anyways so it should also be fun. Technology has games and writing and reading and etc. Those things can help kids have fun but also learn things at the same time.

        "School can often be full of work piling up in the classes we don't enjoy, and stress that gets us down. What if there was a way to make school enjoyable for everyone? Extracurricular activities are teams, clubs, and any other organization run by the school. Many students like these because they have something to look forward to while in school, but not everyone always joins. I believe that students should become a part of organizations because it gives them a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and choose an activity that they enjoy.\n \n In school activities that are outside of class, students have a chance to create bonds with new people. Teams and clubs require working together to make ideas come along, especially student council and sports. This also builds a work ethic for future jobs. Sometimes students may have trouble making friends, so being in a club makes it easy to meet people. Similar interests can also often lead to friendships. Students can also get to know a teacher who sponsors their club better, as many students rarely speak with them in class. Having a more interesting topic to discuss with teachers helps students feel more comfortable around them in class.\n \n Students should become more involved in schools activities. As a yearbook staff member, I know that from experience. I have been able to go onto the basketball courts during pep rallies to get pictures, inform people and work with them about buying a yearbook, and learn about other class when I take pictures and collect information from them. Similarly to student government, students are able to see their hard work pay off when fellow classmates participate in spirit days and other events. With sports, athletes are able to show off their skill and passion for the game while being able to represent their school.\n \n Lastly students are able to choose what they want to be a part of. Not everyone enjoys the problem solving of math or the memorization of history, but it is a requirement to take them. If students join an activity they'll enjoy, then they will have something to look forward to in school. This can also strengthen career paths. If a student is set on becoming a business leader, they can be a part of yearbook or the other organizations that run like a business. If a student is determined to be in the NFL, then they can tryout for the football team. And if they don't find a fit for them, they should be able to make a group themselves. It's important to have a variety of clubs, including students' ideas.\n \n In conclusion, schools should require their students to join extracurriculars just as they require them to take core classes. This is because it gives students a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and be a part of something that they would enjoy.\n \n Students shouldn't dread school, and this is one way to make it better.Â",

This can be a very big help for parents because they will be coming home from work around that time and knowing that their child is safe a school will take some stress off of them. After school schedule usually line up better with work than a regular school day. Money shouldnt be and issue because school do these activities for free, but if something does come up where you have to pay than you could set something up with the school that will work for you and your family. Theses reasons state why extracurricular activities would be good for you.\n \n This is why I think student should participate in at least oneÂ extracurricular activity because it would help them in the future and and they can connect with new people and make new friends.

        "Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.\n \n Having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.\n \n For example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.\n \n Forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.\n \n Forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.",

        'Nine times out of ten children will get bad habits from not adding an extracurricular activity to their schedule.\n \n Causing them to be lazy and end up with bad grades. Because when you add at least one or more extracurricular activity to your schedule, it can help you be more social, get ready for highÂ school, and have a healthier schedule.\n \n First, is being more social. When getting a new activity to do at the end of the day, you will end up with other people. Meeting different people is one of the ways to clear bad social habits. Because of the fact that they are in the same activity as you, some of them might have the same interests. This can cause you to have new friends, this will help you work with others. Working with others is a good factor when you have an extracurricular, and it\'s not as hard as opinions might think. Working with others has a bad side to it because of this you could get annoyed, but you can get use to it by building tolerance .\n \n The second reason is, that it helps you get ready for high school. To get ready for high school you are going to need a good GPA score meaning you need a high grade if not higher. Getting an extra activity can help you if not guide you to the higher GPA. Sometimes the teachers will give you extra credit activities or let you finish work that you want to get done.\n \n The thirdÂ and final reason is building a healthy schedule. Building a healthy schedule is very important because it can effect what you do now and what you will do in the future. When you add something to your schedule it will help you be able to take hard and stressful tasks. This will help you when ever you dont have a lot of people around to help.\n \n Now some people might say that it\'s ""too hard"",""I just dont need it"" , or "" it takes too much time"". But student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. This counter argument dose not compute with what is needed.\n \n If adding an extra curricular activity to a students time, then it will give them social skills, lead them to high school, and help build a healthy schedule. These are the main things that students need to be successful.',

        "What ! The principleÂ is making us participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I remember when I was forced as a kid to do that, I didnt like it at all. I disagree with this statement because, first off some students might not have time to do the extra activity's, secondly the students work hard enough as it is in school, lastly it might be the least favorite thing they do especially if they have to get forced into participating in extracurricular.\n \n Well to start, some students can't stay after, they might need to go home and babysit or watch out for their siblings. Secondly, some kids might have hours of homework that they need to do, they might not have time for extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have after school sports like baseball or football games and they would like to attend to instead of playing or doing something after hours that doesnt matter as much as students sport.\n \n Next, students work all through out the day with hardly any breaks, students want a break from having to deal with taking down notes and hearing a teacher talk for hours. Secondly, lot's of students are stressed out with grades and family problems, so why make them more stressed out by forcing them to do extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have to follow the rules and listen to teachers daily, as a result the students wont be able to learn when to make decisions for them selves if they the teachers are always telling them what to do. Students need to know when to make the decision to stay or not stay, not to be forced.\n \n Lastly, some kids dont like to do extra things like playing games or sports at school because it will make them very sweaty and sticky, the principle is also forcing them to stay. An addition, since the principle is not giving the students a choice they wont like it, but If there was a option that the kids could choose then it would be more enjoyable because they can choose when they want to stay or not stay. Lastly most students like to kick back and relax and spend some time inside their home. I personally would like to be home sometimes after school and watch some movies and fall asleep if I can.\n \n In conclusion, I disagree with with this statement because, it's not fair for a student to be forced into staying after to do extracurricular activities. It's also not right to be forced to stay, especially if a student had to take care of personal business like taking care of family. Principles should already know what could go on at a house, so they need to be more reasonable when it comes toÂ adding on to a persons schedule. I still cant believe that the principle is making everyone stay and participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Â Â",

        "Your principal has decided that students are required to take at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree with this? I agree with this because you may want to stay interested in any of your schools activities. It is important because students want to stay active with there schools and the best way by doing that is by having something for students to experience. Schools have activities for students to do after schoolÂ because they want them to stay active. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students gain responsibility, helps get students motivated, benefit their college and job application.\n \n First things first, having extracurricular activities can help students gain responsibility because in some cases students will be doing things that take someone with responsibility to do. For example, students that are in sports are responsible for having the appropriate shoes and clothes for their practices. This is one reason why activities, that certain schools have, are important. This will motivate students to do better and they would want to succeed in whatever they are doing. This leads me to my second reason.\n \n Secondly, it could help students get motivated to do better in school. This is important because extracurricular activities require you to have good grades and if you like one of the activities you are doing you will be motivated to do good so that you can stay in it. This can allow tons of students to be successful in school and they will try hard in school. Students might want to do certain activities that require them to have good grades and if they don't then they can't do it. This is why in order to do what you like you need to do good in school and it is very important to do good in school.\n \n Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit you when you are trying to apply for a job or just trying to get into a college of your choice. The first thing is that it may help you look good when putting whatever you did on your paper. For example, someone can put they did track and then they got an award for winning a competition, that would make their paper look good. Another example is that if you want to get a specific job and you are in a certain club were they teach you about the job could really benefit you. Like stated in the previous paragraph, it could help you take care of your grades and if you do have good grades colleges would want you. This could help you in the long run because it is important to have some experience with what job you want. Extracurricular activities can help you get to know how you feel about this and if you want to do this in the future.\n \n In conclusion many students need to be responsible in order to keep the activity they want. Students will become motivated to do better so that they can stay in that certain activity. Students will have the experience and they will be able to get the job that they want. These reasons prove on why it is important to have extracurricular activities. This is why I agree on how students should be entitled to at least on activity because it helps students gain responsibility, helps students get students motivated, and it helps students on their job application and college application.

        "Haven'tÂ you ever been so tired to listening to a subject that you seem to dislike? Wanting a break but never able to since its for a grade, well your principal has decided that you can participate in an activity you might like! You can be in a sport, work on the yearbook, or even serve in the student council! I for sure love this idea! It helps kids look forward to something that might not be as tiring and boring as the subjects of schools, run around in basketball, be creative in art class, be inspirational as you work on the yearbook, or help others and the principals being a part of the student council! It all helps in the school system and you might make a change, for example, Generic_Name, a senior in one of the highest ranks high schoolÂ in Japan, was a student councilor that helped hundreds of students from doing a bad choice, grades, or just be someone to talk to. The principal has announcementÂ that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity, and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.\n \n First, it'll make you look forward about something during your day. You might have had a bad day but then you might remember that you're going to maybe you favorite topic class and that might brighten up you day a lot more. It'll be like a small break you get other then lunch. You get to talk with your friends and maybe even your favorite teacher and learn new tactics in the class you might like. A moment class where you can relax and hang out and get grade in too! A lot of high schools, if not all, let you pick the class you wanna be in and you may have other choices too. It's a matter of your and luck but always worth it.\n \n Second, I'll be talking about how you might socialize more. You might not get what I'mÂ saying so I'll just straight up say it, you don't always have to be quiet unless, of course, the teacher is talking. You get to be in groups and learn from each other and depending on what your doing you will get a different pack. For example, if you were to be in a basketball team, you going to see different cons and pros onÂ each player but you'll all will have toÂ work with each other to accomplish you goal, if your working on the yearbook you will all have to speak to each other and work on the same task to show that sometimes two people make a better job then one. It can help you boost up your social skills and your skills with working with others even if you've never met them. Socializing its a big stage in our life that some areÂ very afraid ofÂ and others not at all and this types of things will help you in case if you wanna make a business or be a doctor or police officer or anything, but communication is always the key that you wanna use.\n \n Thirdly, this class may be the best of each year your in high school, you never know. It can be that class you'll always talk to your friends about after you graduate and have memories of. The class that brightened up your whole high school year into one of the amazing years ever, the one class that when ever you pass your old high school or have to speak about it thats the fist thing that comes into mind. That one class that cleared you mind and helped you with drama and other skills you might have needed to learn.\n \n In conclusion,Â the principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity,and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school. This essay will help you understand why sometimes even having another extra class might help you in the future or at that exact moment.",

        "Can you believe that schools are now making students stay after-school to participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with schools having students participate in one extracurricular activity becasuse students need time for other activities outside of school, students need time with their families, and they need time to do their homework.\n \n Many students love coming home right when the school bell rings and having the rest of the day to do what they like. This is not the case at some schools. At my school our principal is having us participate in one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because students need time to play and practice sports such as basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer. Students also need time to hang out with their friends not just inside of school, but outside too. If a student is forced to stay after-school and there is nothing they like there than it may bother the students emotions and make them sad. If a student is sad or upset about this it may affect their participation, attendence, and effort. I do not want kids spending more time than they have to at school.\n \n There are a ton of students who do not get to see their family at all due to school. Students need time to be with their family and socialize with them like playing a board game or having a nice conversation. Extracurricular activities may interfere with the time that kids have to spend with their families. It is very important that kids spend time with their families because it keeps their mental health well, keeps them in line, and provides comfort for them. It keeps their mental health stable because they do not worry about seeing their parents or when they will see their parents again. It keeps them in line because they have somebody to tell them what is ok and what is not ok and they have somebody to discipline them. It provides comfort for kids because they know somebody or some group of people are there for them. If students had no time to spend with their family it would most likely casue many problems for them.\n \n Did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen.\n \n Once again, I believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework. If time that students have for these activities gets taken away by school it may lead to something bad. If you do not agree with me please think about this again and if you do agree with me that is great because you are thinking the right way.",

        "Generic_Name is making the whole school participate in at leastÂ one after school sport. Although most kids arent happy with this i certainly am!\n \n I agree that you should participate in at least one activity after school because, its good exercise for you, its only one activity and its a break from watching TV all day and being on your phone.\n \n The first reason you should do an after school activity is because, its good exercise, doing an after school sport can make you a healthy person because of the constant movement and running you do in most sports. For example sumo wrestlers usually lose up to 30,000 calories a day which is insane isnt it. You dont know how much impact a sport has on your health. Another example of sports being good exercise for you is when your constantly at practice in you do drills like running or in ice hockey when you move around back and fourth, or when in wrestling your sprawling and consistently moving. Stuff like that is the best exercise you can get these days. Or even if its not a sport it can be exercise, when your just walking you are burning calories. everything you do burns calories, even breathing.\n \n Moving on to my second reason on why you should do an after school activity is because its only one activity you have to do. Its not like its for 3 hours everyday of the year. Its not a huge birdin you have to do, its probably only like an hour and 30 mins a day or less for only like a season. But if your that lazy just do something simple and easy that dosent last long at all. Then you'll get your one activity you have to do out of the way so you can spend the rest of your year after school how you would like. The only reason i see you can't stay after school for an activity is because your family needs you everyday after school, or you have a little brother to take care of, things like that. If anything it might motivate you to do more activities after school, or join a league outside of school. All ImÂ saying is its only a little bit of time out of your day so dont sweat it.\n \n My Finale reason why i agree you should do at leastÂ one after school activity is because it gets you away from your phone. Instead looking on instagram and checking out snap chat. Your in the real world doing something instead of posting a selfie for the internet. While your staying after school to do an activity some lazy guy at home is just playing video games in his basement which is not helping him out, or getting the exercise he needs. Plus one day your not gonna be able to do this. Your just gonna sit in a cubical all day working on stuff and doing papers from 9 am to 5 pm. But you seriously need this because you can't be on your phone or the internet for the rest of your life.\n \n In Conclusion i agree that we all should do one sport or activity after school because in reality its good exercise, dosent take that long and its better then looking at your phone. It wont kill you to do a sport and its not that hard. You'll be find doing an after school activity. Once the season is over for the sport your doing then your done, you've gotten it over withÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â",

See not all parents have the time to be driving there kid places if they're busy at home or at work. Some parents have to work late so they can have money. Parents have a lot of responsibilities.\n \n Reasons why we don't have time to do extracurricular activities is because they cost a lot of money. I used to do gymnastics when I was younger but I had to quit because my mom didn't always have the money to pay for it. I was so upset when I figured out I had to quit but I was strong because I can always do it again in the future. So sometimes our parents are struggling and we can't help but to quit. Just because our parents don't have time or money to do it now doesn't mean we can't do what we love in the future.\n \n Don't forget about us kids! We have tons of work to do at school and have to study and sometimes projects for school and its so overwhelming! If we have so much to do how could we ever to do an extracurricular activity! Doing extracurricular activities can also take up the time that you might just want to yourself. Some people don't even like doing activities which means they would but doing they're not happy doing and it's not fun to do something you don't like. These are my reasons why I don't think that all students need to do at least one extracurricular activity.",

        "You just got home from school and you relax for a while then you are going to study and do homework. But you are forced by your school to do a sport or be in the student council so now you have less time to study. I think that student should not have to do something outside of school if they don't want to like playing a sport or working on the year book.\n \n First being forced to work on something you don't want to do can put more stress on kids. Lets say if you are forced to play a sport and you have no athletic ability and you hate that sport with a passion it can make you miserable, you have to spend a lot of time with a sports team and that can really be bad if you don't like it. If a kid cant get his homework done because of something he is forced to do that can also put a lot of stress on kids not being able to get work done. If kids are forced to do something they hate it can really have a negative effect on them and their grades.\n \n Also having to do other stuff outside of school that you don't want to do can take away from them having fun and playing with friends. Many kids now don't get outside as much as kids used to, and having them trapped not being able to do what they want can take away from them being kids. Having kids not being able to hang out with friends can make them not as happy and they can lack good social skills. You can see that forcing kids to do stuff they shouldn't have to do is a bad thing, this can suck for the kids if they have to do this.\n \n However getting kids to do other stuff can help them get off there screens. Kids are playing video gamesÂ way too much these days and getting them a new activity can help get them off. Playing a sport could help kids loose weight and be more fit so they are not unhealthy. This can be good but, making a kid play a sport they don't want to do can make it so they don't try in the sport and don't give any effort because they don't like it. No one wants to play a sport they are not good at. This is why kids should not be forced to do something they don't need to do.\n \n Now you can see how making kids do something they don't need to do is bad. I think schools should not make kids do something school related that doesn't count towards grades. I hope schools don't do this and that kids can just be themselves.",

        "Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities are very important, not only to your health, but to your fututre. Colleges have started looking into extracurricular activities more now then before. Not to mention how much fun they can be.\nCollege is important. It helps set you up for your job and 'adult readiness', but first, you have to get into college. Applications are important, they are a main factor in getting into college, but I wouldn't neccesarily call it your 'make or break'. Grades are exceedingly important when applying for college, but extracurricular activities are just as important. Extracurricular activities can help show that you can commit to something, follow through with it, and you might be very good at it. The more extracurricular activities, the better. For example, let's say an A average student who did no extracurricular activities applies for a college. Another B average student who did one or two extracurricular activities applies for the same college. The B average student is more likely to make it into the college than the A\naverage student because of their extracurricular activities.\nExtracurricular activities can mean many things. It can mean sports, clubs, volunteering, and many more. Sports are well-known to be good for your health. It helps you exercise and stay in good shape. Laziness, especial in teenagers nowadays, is very common. Being required to move and exercise would do our health and body good. Even if we don't do a sport and we chose a club. Clubs normally make you exercise your brain and make you think in a different way than school usually requires you to.\nFinally, it can be fun! Many people who do extracurricular activites found that they liked a certain activity more than others. I, for one, have that expieriance. I tried many sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, swimming, and ballet. I thouroughly enjoyed swimming, baseball, and ballet. However, I didn't do baseball. Now, I'm on pointe in my ballet and going on to my eleventh year of dance and my summer swim team was the Division and Finals champions. I love my extracurricular activities and I feel as though my life would be fairly boring without them.\nThere are so many benefits in doing extracurricular activities and being required to participate is merely helping you get the leg up on your future. In the end, it's all worth it, every bit. It does so much good in your life that you won't even relise it until your older. Therefore, I agree and support the principal in their decision.",

        "If you had to participate in an extracurricular activity, what would you choose to do? You have to pick because the principal said all of the students in the school have to participate. You may have reasons to not do it, but there are some reasons why you should. The main reason is you might actually like it and enjoy whatever activity you choose. So,Â I agree because some people may need the extra activity, others might wanna be more active, and some people may just wanna have fun.\nSome students may need an extra activity. One reason is they may want to be more confident or build their self-esteem. They might want to step out of their comfort zone, and also may be trying to impress someone. The person might also need help with something important to them. They may be struggling education wise and are searching for help. They might need help with a sport or hobby of theirs.\nStudents may be trying to be more active. They might be trying to get and stay fit. This student might want to become a stronger person than before. This person might want to get abs or build up stamina. It might be a goal for them to be a healthier person. It'll be better for their body in general. They'll be able to last longer while stretching and running.\nMost importantly, students simply just want to have fun. Students want to learn something new and exciting. They might want to learn how to play certain sports or games. They just want to have a good time playing together. They might want to play against other teams. The thrill of racing against time trying to get more points is amazing! It's also rewarding to have a victory in something.\nBased on those reasons, I see the point of having students be involved in an extracurricular activity. It's important and you could have some fun while doing so. It's not a punishment, it's probably to make sure you're getting energy, learning something new, playing a sport, or joining a club. Since you could have fun, may need the extra activity, and you may want to be more active, I agree with this decision.",

        "Hello my name is Generic_Name. I am here because I am giving my opinion on whether students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity. I think that it would be good for students in many ways, so keep reading if you want to find out why.\nForcing students to join extracurricular activities is a good idea, one reason is that they might make new friends. This could happen because they would find other kids in they're group who enjoy the same things. Having friends makes school a lotÂ easier and more fun. An extra bonus to having friends is that it is less likely for you to get bullied because you will have people to back you up. Even outside of school having friends is good. Like if you want to play basketball but you arent on a team, well boom! you could go to a court with your friends to run some games. In many ways having friends around will impact your life in good ways.\nAnother good reason for having to do activities is you could find out that your really good at something. Like, what if you could play a mean harmonica without even knowing it? You wouldn't have a clue unless you signed up for an extra activity. You might even be a good chess player. Im pretty good at chess and I wouldnt have known that unless I played a quick game with a friend. You could even make new friends with your newly discovered skills. Some activities can help you later in life, like if you need to knit a rope because you got lost in a forest, or you need to know how to jump start a car because it broke down on the side of the road, well no problem you already know how to do it because of the activity.\nYou could have a lot of fun doing some activities. Having fun is important because you dont want to have suicidal thoughts or depression. Being depressed could easily lead to bad grades and poor choices. Having fun is good because your life will just be better. You can do tons of things to have fun or be happy. Maybe your fun is reading, well then you could sign up for a book club. I have fun playing sports like basketball, or baseball. I like getting fresh air, so I play outside a lot. Again, having fun is so important it makes you want to try more things. Having fun can make people like you more so it could lead to you getting more friends, and having friends is also very important.\nOK! I have given my opinion on why every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities. I definitely think it would help out tons of kids to do it. So we should start as soon as possible. well its time to wrap things up. It was nice writing to you. this was more fun than I thought. See you later, bye!",

        "I disagree in having to make students participateÂ in a sport, or extracurricular activity. Not all students enjoy playing sports or participating in a school activity. Not many parents have the time or money to put their kids in such either, and its also putting more stress on kids during and after school if having to join one.\nWhen being forced to do something such as a sport or school activity the school has to find a variety of the kids liking. Making sure all the kids in his school have a place to have fun at and not just something they have to do and dont enjoy. Having all kids in something at a school can cause running into dept because thats a lotÂ of kids you have to put money towards. Sports can run as much as two to a hundred dollars per kid for any sport, and when having to be forced into a sport that you dont enjoy why waist money. Even when the kids dont want to participate why even try putting your hard working money towards it.\nSports and activities for school are not free. The school has to buy equipment and tools for those opportunities and, sometimes not all parents can physically do that. Sports are a lotÂ of money and when having to be put into one not knowing how you are going to pay for it can be embarrassing. Letting your kid down is the least a father or mother would ever want to do, and when working in the school board having to deal with phone callsÂ from parents saying they cant afford a extracurricular activity would be heartbreaking.\nKids work really hard to put forth effort on school work,homework, and participate in school projects. That can be already enough stress on a kid no matter what age. When having to put another thing on top of school work managing time for sports, and extra activities sometimes kids just cant deal with it. Grades and having a good GPA can come first for some kids. Sports and other things come last. You could probrobaly already have something after school you do and having to move your whole schedule around can be really tiring and stressful.\nThis is why I disagree on having to make kids participate in a sport or activity. Its way to much work, stress, and money. So when coming down to a decisionÂ I agree with a no because having every kid in a sport or activity is absurd.Â",

        "My principle has decided that she wants everyone to participate in a extracurricular activity. In my opinion, I believe it's the best for students to participate in school activity. It will be a great way to have fun, make new friends, and get some exercise.\nMaking new friends is not always easy. Many kids now judge you by the way you dress, act or even look. For example, I was a new girl at a school. It wasn't very easy to make any friends so I decided to stay after school and join a club. As I was joining a club, I got paired up with a girl who was in the same grade as me.\nAt first, it was awkward but then we started conversations and we found many things in common. One thing that we found in common was that we both love dancing. Since then, we have been very close friends until this day. Participating in a activity was the best thing I did to be able to make new friends from a new school.\nAnother reason why students should join a activity is to maintain your health. According to WWW.stay. healthy. com, has stated that participating in a club or activity at least an hour per day is very important for your health. It is also a great way to distract yourself from any anxiety or stress you are facing. Everyday my sister would come home from school. She would always be overwhelmed with the amount of homework she had to do and complain about how much her neck and back was hurting. It was a hard time she was facing and my mom decided to take her to the doctors. Our Doctor, said that her body was hurting because she didn't get any excersice and she also wasn't participating in any activity to distract her. The next day, my sister decided to try out for volleyball. She was great and made the team. By joining volleyball, it helped her feel free because she was distracted by everything negative she was facing.\nJoining a activity doesn't have to be boring or all about running . Activities are meant for you to pick them and do something fun you love. There are many activities to choose from. For example, I love doing pottery. My mom and I would go to a building where they would teach you how to make cups, any animal, and vases. It makes your hands messy but it was so much fun. Next year, for high school there is a class where anyone can take and it is called ceramics. I am beyond excited to take a class where I'm going to do something that will distract me but at the same time I will be doing something that is fun for me. When given the chance to participate in any activity, it is a great way to pick something you know will be enjoyable.\nAs a result, by participating in a activity it helps you maintain your health, have fun, and meet new people. At first, starting something new can take a couple tries until you get it right. In addition, once you learn it is the best feeling ever to accomplish something new. After learning it will become easy and fun because you will already know what to do.\nIt is also a great way to meet new people and make friends who love the same thing you do. Activities help you feel distracted and calm because you are doing something you love and no one is judging you from it. These are my reasons on why I strongly believe that everyone should participate in a extracurricular activity.",

        "Some people might think after school actives are fun and some think not. Some principals think it is required for students to have an after school activity without thinking about how the students feel about after school actives. Students should have the right to choose weather to have and after school activity or not. Students should not have to participate in a extracurciuar activity after school because some students do not have the time, Not a student would like to be forced to do a after school activity, And not all students like to have an after school activity.\nAfter a long day at school some students do not have the time to do an after school activity. They could have after school plans and can not do the activity they were supposed to do. Others have lots of homework to do after school although teachers say that would be a terrible excuse to say but every teacher does not know how much homework the kids have after they're class. Students after school might have to take care of a younger sibling or pet because their mother or father is at work or they could be doing something to help out their mother or father.\nIn many occasions students are force to do an after school activity chosen by the school district. Students are more likely to do the activity if they are to chose it instead of the school district. Because of the students disliking the activity they were assigned they would most likely to skip it and go on with they're day. so instead of forcing students to do an activity have options for them so they can pick for themselves.\nSome students just do not like after schoolÂ actives and they do not have a reason why they just don't. The students would rather study for and up coming test or quiz. They are stay at home kids they go to school and come back home to do whatever they need to do to pass school. Their is no explanation but they just dislike actives after school and if they do not like it then they should not be force to do something they do not want to do. they want to take the time to study and pass the grade instead of doing an after school activity.\nAfter school actives can be every difficult to do for some students because some dont have the time, they would not like to be forced to do it,and some kids just do not like it at all. These are just some reasons on why not give after school actives to students but there are many more, people just do not think about how busy the life of a student is.Â",

        "Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like? Well you came to the right school, cause the principalÂ made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like.\nYou could play on a basketball team\nYou could play on a football team\nYou could play on a flag football team\nYou could play on a baseball team\nYou could play on a softball team\nYou could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team\nI agree with theÂ principalÂ because, when we get home we don't doÂ anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future.\nSo if you don't agree with me, I'll give more reasons like kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friendsÂ while they're after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high schoolÂ sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.\nIt is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did.\nIf your not interested in sports you could do other afters schoolÂ activities like\nBook club\nYearbook club\nDance club\nCooking club\nComputer club\nStudent council\nEngineering club\nYou could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home.\nBut if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.\nIf you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit theÂ teacherÂ you will get expelled.\nIf your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.\nIf you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friendÂ over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend throughÂ basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.\nMost likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no oneÂ knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.\nSo what we know is that joining an after schoolÂ program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could joinÂ for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

You get fired from that job and all because of your school. This is what would happen to many people if schools mandated after school activities. I pick up my brother from his bus stop every day and if I had after school activities there would be no-one to pick him up. I think schools should not force students to take an extracurricular because of Jobs, People, and Time.\nOne of the reasons schools should not force students to take an extracurricular is Jobs. Some students have jobs after school. They might have to work to help support their family. If you made them take after school activities then they wont be able to make it to work on time most of the time and get fired. Nothing good would come of that situation.\nAnother reason is people like friends or family. As I said before, I pick my brother up from his bus stop every day. I also have friends that need to do the same thing. My mom has to go to work and my dad works from home so I'm the only one that can pick him up all the time. Same thing with my friend who also picks his brother up every day. If either of us had to do an extracurricular we wouldnt be able to pick up our siblings. Students also have plans after school with their friends, or maybe they are going on a trip with family. If they where forced into anÂ extracurricularÂ they would not have as much time to hang out with their friends or go places with family. They might be late to wherever they were going.\nThe last reason is time.Â Some students just simply dont have enough time every day to do an extracurricular. They might have clubs after school, or they might play on a sports team. Not everyone has that much free time after school. They have homework, eat, spend time on hobbies, etc. But an extracurricular takes another couple hours out of your day, thats less time to do all those things.\nThere are also arguments for students being forced into an extracurricular but I feel like students should have a choice because everyone is under different circumstances.\nCard Stacking\nWhether you have a job, a sibling to pick up, or plans with friends, you could be stopped from doing any of those things by the mandating of extracurricular activities.\nCall to Action\nSo next time you have a chance to influence a decision about this topic, make sure you make it so that there are no forced after school activities.\nRestate Thesis\nThat's why I think you should not make students take extracurricular.",

Students can find clubs in which they can get help by teachers to do work there struggling to finish.\nIf a student missed a day of school and can't catch up, teachers can stay after and show them and important information that they missed. Tests can bring stress to students , and even make them panic a little, when that happens students can request thatÂ teacher help them and even give tips on how to relax and focus. Trying to juggle so many things at once can be difficult for most students, but teachers are there to help out those in need.\nSport clubs are one of the most popular clubs in some schools, and for good reason. Clubs like these offer students a chance to play the sport they like and represent the school at the same time. Sport clubs also give participantsÂ the opportunity to hang out with friends and create new ones along the way. In some rare chances collages may offer them a fully paid scholarship if they see the student overall success, and while it even rarer some professionals may be interested and ask them to join there team. Sports clubs offer students many opportunitiesÂ to get a head start in life and even get them interested in new hobbies.\nStudents coming to a new school for the first time might be timid or feel alone during the first few day, so why not ask them to come to after school. Extracurricular activities offer new students the change to make new friends and even help strengthen old ones. Many group of friends often hang out after school to just hang out or relax from the stressful day. Many clubs also relate to specific peoples interest, so people can meet others who are interested in their hobbies. Every person is unique and some may struggle to make new bonds, but after school activities can help them meet people who share the same hobbies or help steanthen bonds\nAfter school clubs are some of the key factors in schools. They help them keep high grades, Gives students the chance to do there hobbies like sport, and may even help new kids to make bonds or steanthen them. So I Believe that students should stay after school at least once, to see new interest or make new friends.",

        '""Mom,"" Generic_Name whimpered sadly. ""Why is it so hard to make friends in school?"" Her mother moves slowly towards the edge of her daughters bed and grabs her hand. ""Now sweetie,"" her mother says comfortingly. ""I\'m sure if you tried hard enough you could make friends with someone."" Crying softly Generic_Name turns toward her mother and says angrily, ""It\'s not that easy mom! I don\'t have anything to talk about with these people. We don\'t even like the same things!"" sighing her mother pulls her in for a hug, ""oh honey, I\'m so sorry. I had no idea."" Generic_Name\'s mother can\'t do anything but rock her sobbing child as she cries .\nThis is a sad reality for many kids, throughout all stages of schooling, they have difficulties making friends and often end up feeling isolated and lonely. This problem can be easily solved by school principals requiring students participate in at least one extracurricular activity like a club or a sport. These extracurricular activities would help encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue a passion or hobby, and give each otherÂ opportunities to learn more about themselves while expressing their personal interests and talents.\nThe first reason schools should make extracurricular activities a requirement is because they would encourage students to be more social with their peers. As a student with social anxiety I know how difficult it can be to try and talk to people and make friends, but in my experience i\'ve noticed that clubs and sports give students more confidence in themselves. An extracurricular activity, whether it be a sport or a club, is an 3 and easy way for a student to put them selfÂ out there with people who share their interests. For example when I first started school it was hard for me to talk to people and I didn\'t have many friends, then one day my language arts teacher encouraged me to try out for our school track team. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a chance, and it ended up being one of the smartest decisions I had made that year. After making the team I steadily came more and more out of my shell with the motivation of my teammates. I built strong friendships with many of the girls on my team solely because of the interest that bonded us together, our love for running. Joining track made me more confident in myself, and taught me how to make and maintain unbreakable friendships.\nMy second piece of reasoning as to why schools should require extracurricular activities, is because they would urge students to try new things and become interested in different hobbies. During the years students are in school, their hobbies are constantly evolving at a rapid pace, and they often become interested in things they had never acknowledged before. This example is true to many people, including myself. After track season had ended I decided I wanted to join an after schoolÂ club, but none of the options really caught my eye. After searching for awhile a friend from the track team asked if I would be interested in joining our school robotics club as her teammate. As I had no other options that jumped out to me, I decided to try joining. Since joining the club in my sixth grade year I\'ve developed a passion for engineering and computer programming that I never would have imagined developing otherwise. Taking that one chance to join the club has turned my previous skills and new ideas into a passion I doubt I\'ll ever lose.\nThe final reason that extracurricularÂ activities should be required is that being in a club or sport would assist students in discovering more about themselves. In many cases people find out new things about themselves while participating in a club. It could be simple things such as unknown talents, or as complicated as realizing their social position on a team. When I first joined robotics in my sixth grade year, I was what you would describe as a follower. But when our team captain was out because of a concussion and my team was falling apart, we found out that I was, as described by my coach, ""A natural born leader."" Even being the unsociable person I am, I was able to lead my team with no assistance for three weeks, with a strength I wasn\'t sure I had. After this discovery I was promoted by my coach to be a team captain. For the last three years I have been the captain of my team, and as this is my final year considering I\'m an eighth grader, my coach decided to test my skills. The past four months I have been captain and supervisor of three different teams by his order. I realize as I look back I never would have learned this about myself without joining robotics club.\n""MOM!"" Elise shouts excitedly as she rushes through the front door, ""WE WON!"" from her place in the kitchen her mother lets out a whoop of surprise before running to join her daughter in the living room. Surrounded by her teammates Elise holds the 1st place trophy up proudly as she laughs. The house is filled with the joyous laughter of Elise and her friends from the soccer club. As the girls chat between themselves Elise\'s mother looks on with a smile, proud of her daughter for finding friends that made her happy. Making eye contact with Elise she shouts, ""All right, Group picture!"" Lining up with large smiles on their faces and arms aroundÂ each other, the girls look into the camera with happiness evident on their faces. The snap of the camera ensures this memory will always have a special place in Elise\'s heart.\nWithout having joined an extracurricular activity Elise would never have had the opportunity to make the bonds and friendships she did. Being in a club or sport helps encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue new hobbies, and give each otherÂ opportunities to learn more about themselves and express their interests. Reasons such as these are why I agree that principles at all schools should make the decision requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Â Â Â',

Sports aren't the only option though, there are clubs like chess club, student council, yearbook or debate. This is a good chance for Generic_Name to make some friends. Many students don't do anything after school. If the students don't have an extracurricular activity then they seem less active with other people. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it keeps the students off their electronic devices, makes the students more active with others, and it helps the students to stay out of trouble.\nFirst, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it will keep the students off their electronic devices. People today are very absorbed in their devices. Apps like Instagram, TikÂ Tok, Facebook, and YouTube keep people entertained for hours. When students dont have an extracurricular activity then they are more likely to get on their devices for many hours. If students were to go to an extracurricular activity then they could be more involved in the real world and not crammed inside there house on their phone for hours.\nSecond, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it makes the students more active with other people. Many people struggle with interacting with others, but an extracurricular activity can help students to meet new people. Being in an extracurricular activity will help students to make new friends. Most of these activities require students to interact so they will have to make friends. Having friends in school makes their time there more enjoyable. Going out of the students comfort zone is a part of life they are going to have to do things that make them uncomfortable.\nLast, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it helps the students stay out of trouble. Students are more likely to get into trouble when the aren't in a extracurricular activity because, they may get bored and just go and make some bad decisions. Many students feel peer pressure to do bad things. Extracurricular activities can help create a positive influence on people. Students sometimes feel like they have to be like this or be like that but, the students just need to be themselves.\nJust like Generic_Name students can explore new activities to make friends. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it keeps the students off their electronic devices, makes the students more active with others, and it helps the students to stay out of trouble. Push students to join these extracurricular activities so they can explore what they like to do, and what they dont like to do. If students never get out of their comfort zone then that wont get anywhere in life. Extracurricular activities are good for the students. It gives the students something to look forward to at the end of the day.Â",

        "Imagine yourself running down a basketball court to score a point for your team, winning a debate, taking the perfect picture for your school yearbook, or being the leader of a student council meeting. These scenarios are some activities that students participate in and find joy in doing. Many students try school related activities and result in being very passionate about them. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows them to learn life skills, help find a better activity they could enjoy, and make new friends.\nInvolving students in at least one extracurricular activity would allow them to learn new life skills. For example, if a student were to join Debate Team, they would learn how to properly debate against one another and find evidence to support their arguments. Another example would include sport activities. If a student were to take part in a sport at school, it would teach them about competition. When participating in sports many play to win and the game could get intense. This shows the players competitiveness. Also, if students were to serve in student council, they would learn how to be a leader. Students who are in student council participate in the meetings and come up with good ideas for the school. In life, this skill will be useful because it teaches students how to become a good leader. Students learn all kinds of different skills in extracurricular activities that could be useful later on in life.\nSome students have trouble finding activities they enjoy doing. However, there are many options to choose from when trying to find the right extracurricular activity. Within all of the choices, students could find one they are interested in. For example, when I was looking for a school related activity, it was easy to choose one that I would enjoy because there were so many options that interested me. I chose to run for student council and I have enjoyed my time as an officer. Additionally, many people try to figure out what they want to do in the future around their high school or middle school years. Participating in an extracurricular activity could help someone decide what they want their occupation to be because of an interest in an activity. To add, if a student is interested in one specific activity, they might want to join more that are similar since they share common interest. Finding one activity for a student could lead to them finding many new interests.\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity would also help students make new friends. For example, when doing a team activity, students learn teamwork. Most students find someone they work well with within a group of people and it could eventually turn into a friendship. Also, while working with a group, some people find others that share common interests with them. Most friendships work because they share similar interests in certain things. Additionally, activities are always more fun when you can do them with friends. For instance, when I play basketball independently, I am less motivated and I get bored faster. Whereas when I'm with my friends, my energy is higher and there's more to do. Overall, making new friends is always possible when doing an activity.\nTo conclude, taking part in at least one activity teaches you many different life skills without even knowing it, some students try one activity and find new interests along the way, and while working with others, students develop friendships. All of these advantages lead to a fun and educational experience.Â",

      essay:
        "Extracurricular activities, such as playing sports, instruments, and joining after school clubs are highly encouraged by adults and teachers for growing adolecents. Recently, the principal of the Generic_School stated all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe forcing students to join a club activity will be unnecessary, unproductive, and inefficient considering the cost and the effort. There is not enough data and evidence to ensure that all students will like their activities, it will create a fair cooperation and competition environment among diverse groups of students, and finally to prove that every student will enjoy extracurricular activities.\nMy first argument is that it will force students to participate in an activity that they might not enjoy which is unhealthy. My current school, Generic_School, does not have unlimited budget, faculty members, and space for different club activities. With very limited resources, the school will much prefer to establish more popular clubs than smaller clubs. Options that the school offer may not serve everyone's interest, but students will still need to choose an unappealing activity because it is mandotary. For example, when I was at a camp last summer, I was asked to choose five different activities. However, they did not offer all the courses I wanted and I ended up joining the swimming class which is my least favorite sport. From my own personal experience, I concern how some students might lose their interests or end up disliking their chosen clubs activities.\nSecondly, the plan seems unfair for certain group of students and will develop an unhealthy competition environment. It will simply create a disparity betweeen students who can afford private lessons or tutorings to get better at the activity and those who cannot. For example, a clarinet player who receives private lessons and plays in a local band will be able to perform much harder music and eventually be placed in a more advanced band than his peers who cannot afford the cost. This allows an environment where certain group of students will continue to get better and others cannot. Not only will it pressure the students with unnecessary stress, but it will also burden their parents financially.\nLastly and most importantly, it does not necessary have to be an extracurricular activity as far as the students are passionate about the activity. For example, some people might be passionate about learning foreign languages and cultures or solving creative math problems which are not considered extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are meant to help students find their hobbies and interests. However, for students who already have hobbies that are not necessary defined as an extracurricular activity, such as reading books or writing creative stories, it is not right to force them to do something that they are not interested in when they have already found their interests. Everyone is born with different talent and interest. For instance, I enjoy public speaking and joined the Generic_School Debate team, whereas others might fear giving speechs in front of their classmates during civics class. Extracurricular activities may not be the best option for all students.\nAlthough extracurricular activities are known to promote adolecents' overall well-being in general, there seems to be more disadvantages than benefits to this plan. Because the school board has limited resources to offer, it will be practically difficult to make extracurricular activities mandotary and ensure all students could benefit from this plan. We also cannot make sure that everyone will like the activities and create health and only necessary competition among the students. I value some benefits of this proposal but believe that it is more disadvantageous towards students and that is the reason why I disagree with this plan.Â Â",

        'Trudge,Trudge.\nGeneric_Name\'s feet dragged on the concrete as he sighed, walking into the school.Â The building towered over him while casting a gloomy, grayÂ shadow. As he entered the school, Generic_Name\'s so called ""friends"" ignored him and talked behind his back. He had known for a while that his friends hated him, but Generic_Name hadn\'t had the chance to gain better friends. The boys approached Generic_Name and start ranting about how stupid he was. This was the last straw. ""I\'m done with you guys!"" Generic_Name yelled, and stormed off. ""Fine with us,"" one of his old friends said. Now friendless and depressed,Â Generic_Name wished the school day could be over as he trudged off to his first class.\n""Alright class,"" Generic_Name\'s teacher said while students entered the room, ""Can anyone answer this question?"" No one made a sound. Everyone stared at the teacher pointing to the equation on the board. It was so quiet, you could hear the pin drop from Generic_Name\'s desk. Generic_Name knew the answer, but he was scared to answer. Generic_Name\'s teacher sighed. She said, ""Today we will start a group project. I\'ll assign groups. Remember to work together."" Generic_Name moaned and expected the worst. His group ended up being consisted of students that didn\'t know how to work together. They ended up arguing over everything ""What happened to \'teamwork\'?"" the teacher asked, startled. Generic_Name answered, ""Well if we had more opportunities to work with other people, we might know more about teamwork."" ""I better talk to the principal for more teamwork opportunities,"" Generic_Name\'s teacher said, shaking her head. I agree with the principal\'s decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make friends, increase self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.\nThe first reason why I support the decision of students participating in extra activities is that students can make friends. If students were able to join a club/activity of their choice, they would meet other people with similar interests, leading to new friends. For example, I have participated in the Generic_School Chamber Orchestra since 6th grade, and I met one of my current best friends at this club. I also have friends I met there that are at high school right now. I got closer to these people because I joined Chamber. All of us were advanced at playing an instrument, resulting in many similarities. Students with similar interests that join the same club usually have a lot of time to spend together, resulting in a friendship because they were able to connect for so long. A whole club could learn how fun it is to be around each other and even form a new friend group. I\'m sure Generic_Name could use a new friend group right now!\nThe second reason why I support the principal\'s decision is that students could develop better self confidence. Some people don\'t try out for a sport because they are too nervous about what other people would think about them. If it was mandatory for these students to join or tryout, they could make it and see how good/talented they actually are. This results in higher confidence. A shy and low-esteemed student being part of a club and making friends could finally see how funny they are, making them happier with higher confidence. For instance, I have a friend that I dance with that had a low self confidence. She started making friends, and now she is very outgoing. Maybe if the shy girls tried out for the cheerleadingÂ team, they would join and become a preppy cheerleader stereotype.\nThe final reason why I agree with the decision of students having to participate in at least one activity is that students would develop teamwork skills. People who play sports or participate in clubs know that teamwork is important. A basketball team that passes the ball to each other is more likely to score than a team with one person doing everything. If students were ""forced"" to join an activity, they would develop teamwork skills that would help them for group projects. It would even help them in the future for when they get a job. There are very few jobs now where teamwork isn\'t important because people need each other to complete a task. For example, it would be hard for a construction worker to build a whole house by himself. If the school made it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would help them with teamwork tremendously (especially Generic_Name).\nBounce, bounce.\nGeneric_Name practically skips into the school because he is so excited for Robotics. Ever since the principal made all students join an extracurricular activity, all students seemed to be happy to come to school. The building welcomed all students to a new school day. ""Hey Generic_Name!"" calls out Generic_Name\'s new friends. Generic_Name met them by joining Robotics. He runs to them and the whole Robotics team dives into conversation. ""I\'m so glad that I have such great friends that have similar interests as me,"" Generic_Name says cheerfully. Everyone laughs as they agree to walk to Robotics together. ""Hey everyone! Can anyone answer this question?"" Generic_Name\'s teacher asks while the students got settled in class. Everyone\'s hands shot up, including Generic_Name\'s. The teacher called on Generic_Name and he stated the right answer. ""Correct!"" the teacher said, and Generic_Name beamed. He was proud of himself and his new self confidence. He figured out how smart and funny he was after joining Robotics. He also figured out that he was great at math, and even led his team to victory at the Robotics Championship. ""Let\'s work on our projects!"" the teacher said. Generic_Name\'s group got together and they worked diligently for the rest of class. They each joined a club or sport, so they figured out teamwork. They worked together to produce an A+ worthy project. The teacher said, ""I\'m so proud that you guys figured out teamwork. The principal made a great decision!"" I agree with the principal\'s decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because they can make friends, gain self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.',

        "Many people have at least one activity that they love, care about, or are passionate about. School helps many kids find out their strengths and weaknesses. I believe that our school should make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. This will benefit students tremendously. If these activities can help students expand their social skills, get new opportunities, and let them have some fun at school, then I think our schools should have this requirement.\nFirst, we are going to talk about one of the reasons why the students should be required to be part of at least one extracurricular activity. That reason is sociability. If someone that is shy joins a club that they are interested in, they might talk more because they are in their element and where they feel the safest. Being in a club can also give kids the opportunity to make new friends. Students can learn social skills from working in groups within the club, or working with the whole club. Students might feel like they fit in more if they are in an activity where mostly everyone has a common interest. Depending on the club, there are multiple different ways that doing an extracurricular activity can help a student expand their social skills.\nNewÂ opportunitiesÂ and getting to explore different interests are a great benefit of doing an extracurricular activity. Students can learn about something they never knew existed. One time I was at a camp and they made us choose an activity that we wanted to try. I chose wood burning, and I had a learned a plethora of things that I did not know before. If the camp had never made me choose something to do, I would have never learned about wood burning. This very closely relates with the extracurricular activities. Students can get exposure to different types of activities, and may even find a new hobby that they enjoy. Next, we will talk about the third reason why I believe that we should make the activity mandatory.\nThe third reason why students should have to do an activity is so they can have fun. For many kids, school is work and stress. If they have a club to look forward to at the end of the day, it can make school more enjoyable, and maybe even more fun. It is also relaxing to have an activity that you get to do with your friends, and not worry about homework or tests. Some extracurricular activities may have fun projects or activities to do that students can enjoy. If a student is doing an activity that they enjoy or have an interest in, then it is likely that they will be having fun.\nHaving fun, learning new social skills, and exploring different clubs/activities are just some of the many reasons why our school should make extracurricular activities mandatory. These activities can lead students through a journey of self-discovery, and can benefit most of the students. I think it is the right choice to make all students do an extracurricular activity, and doing so will let kids enjoy some of the things that they care about and are passionate about.",

How many days do you find yourself at home, wishing you were out playing football, but you didnt have a team, or needing help on your science homework, but your teacher wasn't there to help you? Extracurriculars can fix those problems becuase they offer after school sports, help from teachers, and many other fun activities. While they have many advantages, some students won't participate in fear they might not know anyone there, or because their friends aren't doing them. Schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can get you active, are socially beneficial, and can help you in school.\nThe first reason schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular is because it gets you active. Schools offer sports like basketball, football, and various other activities, and you can even be on a team! Being active is a very important factor in being healthy, and has many health benefits, like lowering risk of heart disease. After schools sports can also help you relax and have fun after a long day at school. School is seven hours long, and most of it is sitting and learning. After school, you can join sports clubs to get out all the energy you've been holding in all day, and have fun after all the stress of school. Sports and being active is also fun! You can do some simple layups, or play a whole game, it's up to you! Extracurricular sports clubs are helpful because they get you active and moving, have health benefits, and are enjoyable.\nAdditionally, after school clubs are socially beneficial. When you join a new club, you may not know everybody there, but you will make new friends. You will meet new, interesting people in after school clubs that you didn't know before. These new people could become some of your closest friends, and be super fun and cool to hang out with! You would already know something about them, which is a shared interest in the club you are both in. Meeting someone with similar interests helps to form friendships, and connections between people. You could also choose to do something with the friends you already have, like all joining a club and playing basketball together afterschool. After school clubs are socially beneficial because they help you meet new people, or hang out with close friends.\nFinally, extracurricular activities can help you out in school. You could stay after for a study group to help you prepare for a big test coming up, or simply to understand the material better. You could also stay after with a teacher for a class you may be struggling with. Other struggling students would be there too so you wouldn't be singled out, and all of you can learn together if you are having similar problems. After school study groups can also give you time to finish your homework, and get help or guidance if you need it. As well as homework, you can work on projects in school that maybe you don't have the materials for outside of school. If you have a big art project in progress, you could stay after in art to work on it, to really give it your all, and make it the best it can be. An extracurricular study group is very helpful to your education, and has many benefits.\nExtracurricular groups should be required because they are very beneficial to a students life. They help to get students active, social, and improve upon a students learing experience. I know that staying after school has helped me a lot. When I was struggling with a new unit in math I stayed after school to get some help from my teacher. After working on it for a little bit I could actually understand what I was learning. I wouldnt have understood it as well if I hadn't stayed for a study group to help me. I also know that i love sports, and staying after school for a sports club sounds like so much fun! Schools should require participation in at least one extracurricular activity because they increase your activity, benefit you socially, and help you in school.Â",

        "Think back to your middle and high school days where the biggest decision you had to make was what club you were going to participate in with your best friend. Was is required to join a club, or did you do it for fun and the experience? The majority of students participate in extracurricular activities to learn or practice certain skills they obtained in that activity. Although, this is not the case for everyone because there is still some students that do not engage in non-academic related activities because it isn't required.Â I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives them the opportunity to discover new activities, participate in something new and learn a set of social skills they will carry with themselves for the rest of their lives.\nThere is a very wide array of extracurricular activities to choose from, therefore you have more opportunities to discover something new. You might join a club or sport because your best friend is doing it or your parents told you to give it a try, and you could realize that the activity is something you really enjoy and are passionate about. Sometimes, people get hesitant to try new things, but what harm could be done? The worst thing that could happen is that you don't enjoy the activity and might have to try something different. Overall, joiningÂ an extracurricular activity is one of the best ways to learn about or discover something you truly enjoy.\nAll of the extracurricular activities you engage in should be things you enjoy doing because they take up a big part of your life and can sometimes act as the support you need to get through tough situations. Sometimes academics can be stressful, but that is where the activities that you enjoy come in. Especially as students get older, they tend to resort to their hobbies as a way to keep them calm. Extracurricular activities can also effect your academic performance and the other way around. This is shown a lot through sports because, most of the time, your grades affect whether you get to play or not. Additionally, participating in activities allows you to practice and show off your skills. Therefore participating in an activity can be beneficial to your life in multiple ways.\nHaving a set of social skills is crucial to your adult life, and one of the best ways to understand this is by doing an activity that helps you form those skills. Discipline, for example, is one of the main skills you learn, especially when participating in sports. There is other skills you learn as well that are applied more to your social life. Being around people that are passionate about the same activities you love creates friendships that can last you the rest of your life. Many people meet their greatest friends through participating in activities both of them enjoy. By joining a club or activity, you influence not only others, but yourself to work harder and accomplish your goals. For example, if you were on the soccer team, you might want to make it a goal to work out every day after school to make your stronger. Engaging in extracurricular activities creates additional skill sets that help your social life as a human.\nIn conclusion, participating in at least one extracurricular activity should be required for students because it not only allows them to explore new activities, but it benefits their academic and social skills. Although there can be conflicts with money and time that some students might not have, it is still important to give them the experiences they need to become vulnerable to success.Â",

        "Did you know their are some principals that make decisions that truly benefit the students in the long run. I agree with the principals decision toÂ make all students participate in a extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities, not only help with really important life skills, they provide an opportunity to make new friends and it helps students with their collage and job applications.\nExtracurricular activities help people learn important life skills and lessons. Their are some skills that can only be obtained by practicing and joining extracurricular activities. Skills like, public speaking, typing, writing and being organized are skills that people pick up from a lotÂ of practice and extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities dose not only teach skills it teachesÂ lessons. leaning lessons at an age where it is possible to understand what is being taught, helps those lessons be at the top of their head where it will never be forgotten. All the lessons and skills the people learn stick with them throughout their life time. When I was enrolled into an extracurricular activity by my parents, I learned the skill of how to keep thing neat an organized, and that skill has kept with meÂ ever since. That skill of being neat and organized helps me with finding work for my next class and keeping my locker very usable. Because of the skills and lessons I have learned from extracurricular activities, I agree with the principals decision.\nExtracurricular activities also provide an opportunity to make new friends and strengthen existing friendships.\nThe first time someone attends an extracurricular activity, they are usually bombarded with friendly faces everywhere they look. All of the people that show up to the class are bound to have a social interaction with someone they see. Their are certain extracurricular activities were everyone needs to talk with their peers. Activities like debate and soccer are examples were everyone needs to communicate to each other to ensure that they know what to do and what is happening. Extracurricular activities force people to spend time with each other. When I was enrolled for an extracurricular activity, all we did was work with each other on activities and working with other people enhanced my existing friendships and helped build new friendships. Extracurricular activities have impacted me in a way where without them I would not have meet some of my really good friends, and that is why I think all students should take at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\nExtracurricular activities help with collage and job applications. Extracurricular activities show people the amount of experience someone has. When someone is reviewing an application for a doctoring job for example, they look at how much experience the person has had in the field or on call. The extracurricular activity someone is in, not only helps with showing their experience, it gives that person a taste of what their applying too and it can boost their confidence. Those activities you participate in can also, instead of boosting their confidence, tell them that they might not actually like that activity and pursue a different one. I had always been interested in coding and couple of weeks after I had began I realized that coding was not for me and that I really enjoyed playing sports.\nThe extracurricular activities not only show your experience they also how your determination toward something.\nWhen someone signs up for extracurricular activity they are also sighing up for a course where they have to take out their own time and money for it which overall shows determination towards that activity. The amount of help the extracurricular activities give people is tremendousÂ compared to just learning by yourself and that is my thought process on why every student should be enrolled in to any sort of extracurricular activities.\nThe principal made a really good decision to make all of the students participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\nExtracurricular activities help people obtain certain skills and lessons that can only be provided from extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities also provides a platform to make new friend and enhance existing friendships. All extracurricular activities help show perseverance, determination and experience.\nAll factors like learning skills, making friends, and having experience, are reasons why I think the principal made a good decision. In the long run all of the students that took extracurricular activities because of the principle would be benefiting.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      essay:
        "Have you ever been forced to participate in something that you never wanted to have a part in? Well, this same situation will become a reality for many students at my school very soon. You see, Mrs. Generic_Name, the principal of my school, has decided that each student must participate in an extracurricular activity. This means that a student has to do an activity regardless if they want to or not. If students are required to do this, then they will not be able to complete their mandatoryÂ after schoolÂ obligations, spend precious time with their family, and they will have more stress added to their life.\nFirst off, since most extracurricular activities take place after school, students will not be able to complete their obligations waiting for them at home. For example, many students will no longer be able to watch their younger siblings until their parents return home from work. As a result, parents will need to find someone to watch their younger children. There are also quite a few students who have the responsibility of taking care of their family pets once they are finished with the school day. A few of the tasks that come with this responsibility are feeding the animals, taking them to the bathroom, and exercising them. Along with taking care of their younger siblings and their pets, students also need to complete their chores. So as you can see, it is extremely important that students are able to go straight home after school, instead of staying after for an extra hour or two, so they can fulfill these obligations.\nSecondly, participating in an extracurricular activity will pry into the limited and precious time that students are able to spend with their family. For example, most adolescents get home from school around four o'clock in the afternoon, and many of their parents get home around five in the afternoon. A majority of families eat dinner between five and six at night. Once you clean the kitchen up from dinner, that only leaves about four hours to spend with your family. Depending on when the students' activity takes place, that suspends the amount of time a family spends together to around three hours. That is hardly enough time to do anything together! A famous family counselor once said, \"\"Your child is a newborn for a month, an infant for a year, a toddler for two, an elementary schoolerÂ for six years, a preteen for three, and a teenager for five. Time is precious, so don't waste it.\"\" Children are at school more than they are at home. The more time that is added for school, the less time that is given for family.\nLastly, when students take on an extracurricular activity, they will have more stress added to their life. For example, if Generic_Name decided to write for the sports section of our school paper, he would need to go to every basketball, football, and baseball game. Then, he would need to write a detailed report about each of the games that he goes to. Since basketball games are every Monday, the football games are on Friday nights, and baseball games are on Saturdays and Sundays, Generic_Name would be writing at least four reports a week. That doesn't even include if any of the teams make it to the State Championships. If another student decided to join Drama, then he/she would need to attend at least seven weekday and two weekend practices a month, four dress rehearsals, and all five performances. Plus, the student would need to stay after each performance to help clean the set and put it back into order for the next night. Along with all this extra work of being in an extracurricular activity, students also have to complete their never ending work load from school. With all of this combined, there is enough stress to give these students severe health problems.\nIn conclusion, being required to take part in an extracurricular activity will result in students not being able to complete important after school obligations, losing precious time to spend with family, and having extra stress added to their life. Having the activities are a great idea, but the problem is that Mrs. Generic_Name is requiring them. If she allowed the activities to be optional, then families wouldn't have to find someone to watch their younger children, those who chose not to participate would be able to spend more time with their families, and there would be a lot less stress for the students to handle.Â From what you have read, I hope that you will agree with me and take a stance on my side against Mrs. Generic_Name's decision for participating in a mandatory, extracurricular activity.Â",

How are you going to fit that into your already busy schedule?\nI don't think that the principal should require students to participate in one extracurricular activity.\nI think this because some students do not have the time to add another activity into the day, school should not control your personal life, and although some students might be doing the bare minimum, that doesn't mean other students aren't trying hard in school.\nTo start off, students should not be required to have one extracurricular activity because some students do not have the time to add another extracurricular activity into their day.\nAlthough some activities might be in school, they add on more work and stress to the student.\nSome students struggle to complete homework by their bedtime everyday.\nSome students do not even finish their homework until around one in the morning.\nThose students also have to wake up around 6 to go back to school.\nThat comes out to about 6 hours of sleep when they should be getting 8 or 9 hours of sleep.\nThe situation for every student is different.\nFor example, a student might have to take care of a younger sibling and tend to the house while both the parents work. Do you think that this is fair?\nReason number two for the principal not requiring a extracurricular activity for each student.\nSchool should not be able to control your personal life along with your school life.\nThere is a border between your personal and school life.\nTime is a precious thing.\nIf one extracurricular activity equals around 1-2 hours, then that will mean you will finish you homework two hours later, and that means you will have less free time to hang out and relax.\nSo, instead of going to that movie or dinner with your friends, you have to do homework and study.\nSchool already takes up 6+ hours of your day, how much longer can they make it?\nMy final reason that students should not have to add an extracurricular activity to their day is that some students are already working hard for their age and some students are not privileged like other students.\nTheir families might be struggling to make ends meet every day and they might have to work a job just so their siblings can eat dinner.\nThey are already hardworking and shouldn't have to work more just because the principal wants to require this.\nAdding this activity will just add more stress to the student.\nThe school is not aware of everyone's situation. I do not think that these hardworking students deserve this.\nIn conclusion, the principal should not require an extracurricular activity because some students are too busy to add another activity into the day, your personal life is separate from your school life, and the principal should not be able to add more work on to the stressed, hardworking students.\nDoing something like this would not be fair.",

        "Humans are like penguins. Just as penguins huddle together in the midst of a storm, humans huddle together in groups and find comfort and healing when they're with people that have the same interests. If that's the case, joining extra-curricular activities is a good opportunity to not only build life-long friendships, but also learn about different clubs and hobbies everyone can dive into.\nFor starters, being on a team automatically builds friendships and an unbreakable bond. A team is a group of the most valuable people in your life because members encourage one another and lift one another up. In many professional games, team members root for each other and help each other to be successful. When you see members respecting one another, there's no doubt about the friendship and love between the members. Also, people with the same hobbies become close very quick because of the same passion. I have met many of my close friends through the love of sports. Since my team had the same love of softball as I did, I felt as if I had known them for many years and something just clicked. Lastly, teams stick together. Through thick and thin, players stick together. Many professional players have been with each other for a long time. Since they've been together, they know each players strengths and weaknesses and how to help them. Gradually, a friendship forms and a life-long partner is born. All in all, being apart of a group not only forms a deeper love for the sport, but friendships beyond compare.\nSecond, anyone and everyone can be apart of a group. This is the perfect opportunity to try new things and learn about new hobbies. For example, many people didn't even know a club about learning sign language existed, but after trying it out, they became in love with the art of sign language and ended up becoming translators in the future. Also, you never know where this small hobby can lead to in life. For instance, one of my favorite hobbies is playing chess. When I was first forced to attend the club, I didn't know anything whatsoever about chess. However, I soon realized I loved playing chess and it was a good opportunity I seized. Lastly, everyone deserves a safe community full of people with the same passion. Research shows that those with a group to be in have a stable mentality and more self-confidence. Therefore, joining a simple community can even boost self-confidence and open doors to unknown hobbies.\nIn conclusion, being apart of a team or club benefits many aspects of life such as an incredible bond and friendship with team members, and a safe environment with other people that share the same interests. Something as simple as joining a club may change the way you perceive life. Just like penguins, everyone deserves a place to be.Â",

Having an extracurricular activity will help you make new friends, feel good about your self or just in general, and you can also be yourself.\nWhile doing an activity you will be able to make new friends. At the activity you will meet new people that you probably have never met before. By meeting new people you are gaining new friendships and gaining new people that you can count on, and trust. You can also meet people that have the same interest as you. Therefore you will be able to do stuff together and will end up going the the same activity, and will be able to do things together because you both like the same things. You will also be bale to understand each othersÂ point of view. When people are asking you question about your activity you can both see where each otherÂ are coming from and can give them tips and tricks that they can use in the activity, and you can agree on the pros, and cons, the easy, and not so easy parts. While in the activity you can meet new people, make new friends, and who know you could both be friends forever.\nBy looking for an activity you can find that one thing that you love to do earlier and younger in your life. You can find things that your good at may that be sports, acting, singing, photography, and so much more. Also you can keep searching until you find something that you want to put your heart into. By searching you may find new things that you never thought that you would like. Maybe you thought that you would LOVE basketball but then end up loving pottery. Or maybe you thought that you would LOVE acting but instead you like singing. There are so manyÂ things that you could end up trying and loving them. You could also find thing that will make you feel good, may that be about your self or in general.

Or even doing something that you love will put you in a better mood because you cant wait to do it or go back to it again, and therefore will have something to look forward to everyday. Therefor you can find things that you love and continue to do it and grow and be better.\nHowever having an extra curricular activity can mean more harm than good. When you have an activity you may not have enough time for house hold duties or even your homework for school. Your activity may run later and you may get home late. The you will have to eat something if you didnt already before, and get ready for bed. But by that time you may not have enough time for your school work or the things that you need to do at home. But if you learn how to time manage everything that needs to be done then you should be okay. By challenging your self you are growing better as a person, and will be able to do things that may be harder for other people to do.\nIn conclusion it is a good idea to do an extra curricular activity as it will help you meet more people, be more comfortable with your self. Will help you get out of your comfort zone and get out there and live. Also find things that you are good at and love. And by doing something you love you are learning little by little to love your self. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

As a result of their numerous advantages, many schools encourage their students to participate in them. My principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activityÂ can be beneficial, as it gives them a chance to make more friends, be more productive, and find possible career options or passions.\nOffering students the opportunity to participate in extra curricular activities gives them a chance to get to know more people, and make new friends.Â When socializing during these activities, they can get to know people that they would not meet without this opportunity. They can also share their passions or hobbies with other people who might have the same interests, causing them to become friends.Â The third reason is that they might see friends that they do not often see during the school day. These activities cause students to engage in different conversations, and be more social around other people.\nParticipating in extracurricular activities might result in students performing tasks that are more productive compared to what they usually do at home.Â At home, students might be bored and might not have any tasks or activities to complete after doing their homework.Â As an effect of not having anything to do, they might waste their time playing video games or going on social media. Similarly, this would be a waste of learning time where they could be more productive, and could find new ideas or projects to do. These activities can help students see that there are interesting tasks that they can explore, which are more useful than using social media, phones, or other distractions.\nEncouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them find possible career options, and discover new interests or passions. As they perform different tasks provided by these activities, they can find new interests that they did not know they had. Different chances offered can help students develop a passion that they already have, as they might not have necessary tools for it at home. Additionally, adults organizing these tasks can introduce career options in the field of the activity to students who are interested in them. Extracurricular activities can assist students in finding which pathway they will choose for their careers.\nAs a conclusion, all these factors are beneficial for the students, which show that these activities provided by the school can help them with their social life, as well as academics and other work. It encourages them to dedicate their time and effort. As proved by these reasons, the decision made by the school principal concerning extra curricular activities can be beneficial and extremely rewarding for students, by providing them with an opportunity to make new friends and get to know more people, perform productive tasks, and discover what possible career options and jobs there are in different fields.Â",

Whether or not they want to do an extra-curricular activity should be left up to them, and only them, not their parents, and most definitely not the school and the state. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "I believe it is wrong and i disagree with it. Here's why, the students should have their own rights and opinions on what they want to do, they shouldn't be forced to do an activity. A student could have a medical problem or they may not have the time to do the activity. Students should feel comfortable and feel like they have freedom. It could also lower morale at the school, because students could feel pressured or stressed.\nAn activity is not must, it is usually something thought about doing for maybe spare time. It is an invasion of freedom, In a way, to make students pick to either play a sport, work on a yearbook, or serve on the student council without their will and some type of benefit. It could also effect their parents/guardian, if students are made to play a sport, because the parents/guardian would most likely have to drop them off and pick them up from games or practices. It should depend on what the students want to do and what they can do, no one should ever be forced to do something if they don't want to do it.\nI think they should allow students to do an activity and give them the choice to decide if they want to do it or not. It could make the school benefit, if they did that, because it would raise moral and it would make students feel comfortable and not stressed. The students would have way more energy and focus if they are abled to decide if they want to do an activity or not.\nMy conclusion is if you want students to feel comfortable and positive let them decide what they want to do with their lives. don't make them do an activity if they don't want to do that activity or if they don't want to do any activity at all. Students should have atleast some freedom at school and they should feel like they have control over their life. Let students decide what they want to do if you want the school morale to stay positive and the students to have good energy and focus.",

        "Your principal has decided that all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Should schools make students do a extracurricular activity, do you agree or disagree? I disagree, schools shouldnt make students do that because the activities are something extra for the students who want it. Another reason is if you force someone to go out of their comfort zone, theyre less productive. Lastly, if it was a requirement the schools would need more activities such as clubs and sports teams. In conclusion, schools should not turn these activities into a requirement.\nFirst, schools shouldnt because it is meant for people who want something extra. People who do these activities usually require good grades. Others may be looking at something new. Then they're are ones who just like to do things so they do whatever interests them. This is why these activities are supposed to be something extra.\nAnother reason is if you force students or anyone to do something it usually means they're less productive. If someone joined a play for the school by force its most likely they will be removed because of either not helping or they're not working.\nLastly, if it was a requirement schools would have to make more clubs or sports teams. Schools can have a lot of students mine holds about 1,000 and they're are sport teams or clubs that are too large. FFA and FCCLA are competing clubs but if the schools make it a requirement people will choose them thinking theyll not do anything and ruin it for the ones who enjoy the club. Another good one would be if the school puts on a play certain people may ruin it by moving or breaking props or other impotantÂ items.\nIn conclusion, schools shoud not turn these activities into a requirement. Schools should leave these activites alone and let the ones who want to do them choose to do it. If the school did change the requirement there would be a lot of people who dont work. It wouldnt require as much room to leave them as a choice. This is why i disagree with this decision,",

        '""I have nothing to do after school,"" cried Generic_Name,""I\'m gonna be so bored."" ""You should tryout for soccer!"" exclaimed Generic_Name. Generic_Name wasn\'t keen on the thought of trying out for soccer. ""I mean, I\'m not very athletic, and I don\'t have very good foot eye coordination."" Generic_Name said wearily. ""That\'s okay. Just try it, you never know, you might enjoy it."" Generic_Name said, trying to motivate Generic_Name. Confidently, Generic_Name responded with, ""Okay, I\'ll try it."" All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.\nTo start with, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them make new friends. This is important because it can help a student who struggles socially. For example, say that you don\'t make friends very well. Joining a sport or a club will help you find someone who shares the same interests as you. Another reason is that it will help students become close with students that aren\'tÂ in their grade. For instance, almost all school activities are open to all grades. This is the only time students will be able to socialize with the grades above or below them. So it\'s important that they take advantage of it. Lastly, it\'s important that students make new friends because it can help them become more involved in school activities. To emphasize, I ran track my eighth grade year. My friends motivated me to tryout. I ended up loving it and making so many new friends with sixth and seventh graders.\nSecondly, requiring students to join a school activity will keep them busy. To start of with, when students are done with their homework they immediately go on their phone. To fix this problem, keeping students busy with a sport or a club will prevent them from being on their phone to much. Moreover, so many kids complain of being bored and not having anything to do after school. This is because they\'re not busy. To support my opinion, during track season I never complained of not having anything to do. I was always occupied either with homework or I was at practice. The last reason why it\'s important to keep students busy is because it gives them the opportunity to practice their time management skills. To illustrate, at the beginning of track season I was very stressed about how I was going to complete all my homework. By the end of the season I knew how to manage all my time and didn\'t have to stress on how I was going to finish my homework.\nFinally, requiring students to participate in a club or sport gets students get out of their comfort zone. Getting students\' out of their comfort zone is important because it prepares them for the work force. To elaborate, in the work force you don\'t get a choice whether or not you do something. You have to do it, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Another reason is that putting yourself out of your comfort zone can make you grow into a more confident person. For instance, I joined MAC committee when I was in eighth grade. Talking in frontÂ of a whole class made me uncomfortable. Now that I look back at it, it was worth it. I\'m so much more confident as a person.\nAnother reason is that getting out of your comfort zone can change your point of view. To illustrate, my friend\'s parents forced him to join the art club. At first he thought it was weird and only for the ""geeks"". Joining the art club changed his whole point of view. He now loves art and wants to pursue it as a career.\n""This is so fun!"" Generic_Name exclaimed, as she kicked the soccer ball. ""I told you, all you had to do was get out of your comfort zone."" Generic_Name responded. ""Yeah, you were right. I\'m so happy that you encouraged me to do this. I\'ve made so many new friends and found out I really enjoy playing soccer."" Generic_Name agreed, ""Me too. Soccer keeps me busy and off my phone."" In conclusion, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.',

I agree that every student should have to do one extracurricular activity because, doing actives outside and having to move a lot will keep you fit and healthy, when you work hard on things to maybe help your school it will make you think outside of the box, and extracurricular activities will help you meet new people and make new friends.\nYou should really participate in sporting extracurricular activities because it will keep you fit and healthy. When you are playing sports you are moving and this in an extracurricular activity. When you move and workout it helps you to burn fat which will make you healthier and more fit. As well as when you do activities that make you move you will have more fun and have a great time. There was this one time where I was really bored and had nothing to do in Elementary school so my friends told me to sign up for this running club where they do activities and really practice running. It really helped me have fun and, it also helped me get fit. So if your a sporty kid or not you should participate in sporting activities because you will have a lot of fun and will get really fit.\nWorking on things for your school is a great extracurricular activity. When you work for the school maybe under a project it makes you think outside of the box. When you think outside of the box your getting out of a small mindset and doing projects and working hard is a great way to practice getting out of the small mind set and really think big. When you work on school projects you must also work efficient so it is a great way to practice how to work efficient. In Elementary school I worked on the school yearbook. It was a lot of fun and I really had to work hard and smart so I could make the yearbook look really good .So if you can learn how to work efficient and use big ideas you can really do anything.\nWhen you do extracurricular activities you are able to make new friends. This is a great way to just join in with everyone and have a lot of fun and meet new people. When you do activities in sports you can meet new people who also love sports or who have other of the same interest as you. When you maybe do and extracurricular activity for an art club you can meet other people that love art and then maybe you guys can become friends. I once did a basketball club in Elementary school. Even though I was not that good I still met friends who were just like me just there to learn. That is why extracurricular activities are great ways to meet new friends.\nI chose to agree that that every student should do one extracurricular activity instead of disagree. I think that you should do extracurricular activities they will really help you in every way possible.

        "Agree or disagree? I think joining in a extracurricular activity is very beneficial, because students are able to be a little more active and help the community. Extracurricular activities has so many outcomes to participating in these activities. Students may not have the opportunity to do there pleasures that may they do at home or once they get out of school. This can also interfere with a students social and sport life. Although there are down sides to extracurricular activities there is a huge benefit such as, knowing that a student has helped or even cared about what he was doing weather it was planting plants, trees, flowers, playing a sport, or even helping a student with their homework. I strongly stand by the that participating in an extracurricular is beneficial, not only is it beneficial it is also enjoyable.\nSome activities that students are able to participate in are sports, yearbook committee, student council, and helping out with the environment. Another way this is beneficial is because weather you like it or not it really helps out the person, the community, and even the ourselves. While doing these activities you continue to make someones day by helping out just even a little bit. Many people, including myself enjoy watering the plants, a little goes a long way. Students often enjoy getting to know others and this is a great way to do so. How cool is it to know we have done an extracurricular activity and while helping our community? There are many activities that students are able to learn and put their brain to the test in a extracurricular session, for example student council. Student council is one of the many mind and brain focusing activities there are in these activities.\nExtracurricular activities can be enjoyable and entertaining. I used to stay after for yearbook committee, and we all learned some new and interesting things. While I was in that that club I was given the opportunity to learn a little more about how I can work on the computer and cropping/fixing images. This activity was very helpful and fun. I now know how it all works out and how I can get involved. If it hadÂ not been for my teacher who told me to get involved I wouldn't be as involved as I am right now. I know enjoy doing extracurricular activities. Lastly, Helping out is not such a horrible thing.\nParticipating in activities at a local school doesn't have to be terrible. There are so many activities out there that everyone can try and enjoy. Students get so many interesting things they ca do. Should students participate, yes they should. Many students want to just go home and not do anything, this helps them come out of their shell a lot more. School is not always boring, have fun at school. What will your next extracurricular class be, what will you do to get involved?Â",

        "I agree with the principals decision of every student having an extracurricular activity. Many students might disagree with this decision, because of some students not wanting to have an after school activity. However as being a student myself I have chosen to agree with this decision. When students have an after school activity, the activities that they choose to do can impact them in many ways. There are many reasonsÂ on why I believe that a student should participate in at least one after school activity. However, here are three reasons why I hold the opinion of students being required to have an after school activity.\nStudents will become more involved throughout their school community. If a student joins a school sport club they might be able to make some new friends. When students are able to make more friends they will not feel bored in a class if they have a new friend that happens to be in that same class. Students will also be able to know what is happening in other parts of the school, because of making new friends. When students are more involved in their schools community, they won't be confused of what is going on within their surroundings.\nWhen students have an after school activity, they might figure out what career they would want to have in the future. For example, if a student chose to serve on the student council. This extracurricular activity can help students to decide whether or not they would in the future run for a government position. If a school has Home EC as an extracurricular then a student might choose to become a baker in the future. Depending on the what your school offers, any activity you decide to join will help you when it comes time for choosing an occupation.\nIn the future students will be able to reflect on the things that they have done in the past. When a student becomes older their kids may ask what they did when they were younger. Which is a reason why students should work on their schools yearbook, because they will be able to show their future children what they did in school. These students will be able to show their children the yearbook that his or her classmates made together. Therefore, being another reason why students should participate in activities because of being able to reflect on the past.\nAs you may now know the many reasons on why I believe that students should have an after school club. Like I said before when a student chooses a certain activity, this activity may hold an impact on their life. Requiring students to have an extracurricular activity encourages students to be more involved. I believe that the principal has made the right decision by enforcing students throughout the school to join a club. In conclusion, I think that requiring students to have an activity will benefitÂ many students.",

        "Extracurriculars are activities that generally take place after school hours. These activities can range from clubs like Jazz Band or Latin Club to sports like Soccer or Basketball. Students stay after school to attend activities such as these for fun. Making these activities mandatory could create health problems in some students, take valuable time away from students, and ruin the fun of extracurriculars.\nFor some students, just being in a school building can give them anxiety. Making them stay after school to participate in extracurriculars would worsen this anxiety. Some extracurriculars even require extra work outside of school, adding more stress to the stress students already edure everyday at school. Requiring students to participate in extracurriculars would affect the attitudes of some students, since they are being worked harder than usual.\nSome students' parents can't get off work early to come pick their child up after extracurriculars. Some students have siblings that need to be taken care of after school everyday. Extracurriculars take time away from student to finish their homework. For some students, it can take several hours to complete a single homework assignment. Students would have to stay up later to do their homework making them tired at school the next day.\nMandatory extracurriculars would create overcrowding in clubs, given that more students would be attending them. Some clubs have limits on the amount of students allowed in the club. More teachers would have to stay after school to accommodate the amount of students in extracurriculars. This change would take time away from teachers who have to grade our school work after school, causing them to have to work in their usual free time.\nOverall, this decision would change the entire idea of extracurriculars, making them seem like actual classes instead of the fun activities they are supposed to be. I believe that making extracurriculars mandatory for all students is a bad idea. I think participating in after school activities should be left to the choice of students and not teachers, and I hope this essay has made you feel the same way.Â",

The examples provided are such as, sports, extra studying, tutoring, and clubs. If there was a vote on having an extracurricular activity, I would vote ""yes"". There are many good and important reasons to have an activity, here is why.\nMy first good reason is that having an activity can be really fun. At the end of the school day, you would have something to look foward to. You can make new friends and spend some time with them. You can maybe discover a new hobby you are good at. You can do the stuff that makes you happy.\nMy next good reason for a having an activity, is that it would be helpful in school. If you are having trouble not understanding a subject or concept or your grades are low, this can solve that problem. By having private help from another person, this can make you understand a subject better. Also, it gives you a chance to bring your grade up. It can make you be a better learner or make you be ready and prepared for a test.\nMy final reason for having an activity is extra playing time for sports. School is sometimes fun, but if you like sports, than this is a good way to do the thing you really love. If you are just starting or just learning how to play, than this can be a big help. You would have the ability to know what to do in a practice drill or in a real game. This can make you be even better about baseball, basketball, or soccer etc.\nIn conclusion, having an extracurricular activity is a great idea. You can find the thing you are really good at. It is also a good time to socialize with other people. This is also one of the ways to get extra help in school. You can enjoy any of the things you love to do during this time of the day.Â',

Some kids have had to move schools and house just so their child does not become a gang member. I know some people who have ha to move because they lived in a bad neighborhood and their mom and dad pulled them out of school to come to a better school.

Students should join a club because, it can help relieve stress from school, clubs can help you meet new people, and it can give you a hobby to do at home.\nFirst, students get stressed easily when a big test is coming up, or if they have a lot of homework and can\'t do it all. Stress can make you feel unhappy which can build up anxiety. When I was in sixth grade I was not in any clubs, and during tests I would panic and forget the answers. I decided to go to the councilor for help and the councilor gave me some good tips on how to keep calm during a test. Having a club to go to can give you something to look forward to during the school day and make you feel less anxious about school work. When I was in seventh grade I joined the yearbook and FAC\'S clubs. I didn\'t feel stressed during a test and my school work seemed easier than the year before.\nAlso, clubs are a great way to meet new people and make new friends. Somebody could like the same thing as you and you never knew. When I was a seventh grader I joined the yearbook club and on the first day\nGeneric_Name told us to get into groups of two or more and go to take photo\'s of the other clubs around, but I didn\'t know anyone. I was walking down the hallway with a boy, and to my surprise he put his hand out and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in eighth grade."" I took his hand and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in seventh grade."" Clubs can help you make that first step to say hello. In eighth grade I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club, I started talking to people that I had never talked to before. I found that these people that I have never talked to have something in common with me. I started to talk to these people I met around the school too.\nThird, sometimes when you join a club that club becomes a hobby and you start to do it at home. In my seventh grade year I joined the FAC\'S club. In the FAC\'S club we would bake and cook food, then I started to bake cookies and brownies more often at home and I also got my brother into it too. Know even though I am not in the FAC\'S club I still love to bake. Clubs can give you an opportunity to try something new, and most of the time if it is something that you like you start to do it at home. In my eighth grade year I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club. I shared it with my brother, and know we invite his friends to come play a campaign with us almost every weekend.\nGeneric_Name stood up and walked toward his mom, then opened his arms up to give his mom a hug. "" I am sorry mom,"" he said,"" I will try to make friends."" The next day Generic_Name came home and strolled down the hallway to his room. He came back out and walked over to his mom."" Hey mom,"" Generic_Name said. "" What is it Generic_Name do you need help with your homework?"" "" Well actually mom, I took a flier from the tennis club, I was wondering if you would sign it?"" Generic_Name smirked. His moms face lite up and jumped in the air. She grabbed a pen and neatly signed the formÂ like she was about to win the lottery. A few weeks later Generic_Name\'s mom was sitting on the bleachers cheering for Generic_Name who is working hard on the court. Generic_Name took the last hit and swung his racket as hard as he could. The ball hit the ground and the crowd on the bleachers jumped in the air. "" Nice one Generic_Name, you learn so fast!"" Generic_Name\'s friend exclaimed. "" Thanks.""

        "I definitely agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For one, it would help raise their GPA, especially if it is low at the moment. Most of the time there is an extracurricular activity for everyone, like STEM, Home EC, Yearbook club, Shop, and so on. Extracurricular activities provide a fun alternative than just going home at the end of the school day. Students can stay after school, come before school, or even go during their lunch period to their extracurricular activity.\nHowever, an injury or disability, like a broken leg or perhaps a learning disability could prevent a student from doing an activity that they want to do. Most of the time there are other activities that the student could do if they can't do the one they want. Sometimes, that particular activity could be canceled, maybe due to the weather if it is an outside activity, like a sports club, or maybe the supervisor isn't there that day. Maybe the student cannot go on a particular day because they already have something scheduled after school.\nSome people might not agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. They might say that the student may not have time for it, or there is no activity that they like. If there is no activity that a student wants to do, they can just start a club for it. If they don't have time for that particular activity after school, they can just integrate it into their daily schedule. For instance, if they can't do it on a Monday, they can do it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. They can also serve on the student counsel and perhaps get a particular activity listed as something other students can take. For example, if a school doesn't have a\nHome EC class, the student counsel can possibly try and get that into the course list.\nTaking an extracurricular activity is a good idea for anyone who: has a free schedule; wants to increase their GPA; or wants something fun to do. There is almost always an extracurricular activity for everyone. In conclusion, it is definitely a good idea to take an extracurricular activity whenever possible.",

        "In this day and age of society, most students that attend middle or high schoolÂ revolve around electronics. This is something that I think should change because some students prioritize using electronics over socializing with other classmates or friends. I agree with my principal, and I think that a student must participate in one or more extracurricular activity.\nParticipating in one or more after school activity in my opinion is a great way to socialize with new people, and make some new friends. Playing sports for example builds you as a team player, and helps you have a stronger connection with your team mates. I am currently training for freshman football at Generic_School for next year. Some of my friends and I go to Generic_School and work out in the weight room together, giving us a feeling of support from one another. During training, we are listening to music while we help each otherÂ out with the workouts we are supposed to do. While at workouts, we also get to know some of the JV and Varsity players who attend Generic_School currently. Doing football was a great Idea because of the strong bond I now have with my friends and the current high school players. When we have away games, we all take the bus to go to the other schools, and on the bus, we all talk and prepare our selves for those games. If you don't participate in a sport, general activities are great to socialize in too. Last year, I chose an activity which was out of my comfort zone, tennis. In tennis, I was in a group of about 7 or 8 other kids who I didn't know at all. But when I get showing up to the practices, and I kept making an effort to befriend the other kids, it ended up working out for the better. I got to make new friends and become good at the sport.\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity is also a great way to have fun. Even if the activity you want to participate in isn't a sport, you can always have some fun in an activity that interests you. Having fun for just an hour or so usually brings anyone'sÂ day up to a better mood. I participated in the yearbook committee in 6th grade at Generic_School and it was a great experience. I would have so much fun hanging out with all my friends while we were designing the yearbook and taking pictures for it. Now, even though the yearbook committee wasn't my first choice for my extracurricular activity, it was still really fun in the long run. I also played recreational league soccer in 5th and 6th grade. At the start of every season, our teams would switch players meaning I would have new teammates every time. This was a great way to have fun with different people and cooperate with them as a group. After every one of those activities, I would leave with a smile on my face, and just being there for that one hour made my whole day better.\nExtracurricular activities can also teach you a lot of new things. Yes, doing an extracurricular activity is fun and all, but you end up learning a lot. In the yearbook committee, I learned how to upload pictures onto a document, how to format the pages to have rows of pictures, and to decorate the pages with cool designs. In football, I learn the different types of positions to play, the different playing styles of other players, the different positions to play, and I also learn how to train properly to play the best I can possibly play. In soccer, I also learned different techniques on how to be the best player I can be. Some activities teach you more than let you have fun, but if you like the subject it is on, than it, again, is a great thing to do. I think learning while you are also having fun is one of the best things in life because it is always good to learn, but it also depends on how you are being taught.\nIn conclusion, doing an extracurricular activity benefits you more than anyone else. They teach you good things, you have fun while participating, and you get to socialize with your friends and potentially make new ones. This is why I agree with the principal, and I think we should do at least one. Â",

        "Do you ever wonder what it would be like, if your principal forced you to participate in an extracurricular activity?Â There would be much debate over whether it's a good idea, or a bad idea. Some students would agree with the principal. Some students would disagree with the principal. It's the same way with the parents. Here are three good aspects of having to participate, and my opinion. I agree because students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find a new hobby.\nMy first reason as to why I agree, is because students can get more exercise. Students get a good amount of exercise in gym. However, some students don't get any other exercise. Plus, it is always good to get more exercise. Students need to maintain a healthy body, because a healthy body is a healthy mind. Getting exercise releavesÂ stress for some students. some are lazy couch potatoes, and need to get off their butts.\nMy second reason as to why I agree, is so students can make new friends. Some students don't have a lot of friends. A student without friends is like a puppy left out in the rain. However, forcing them to participate in an extracurricular activity can change that. Some students like making friends, but don't know how to make friends. Some students have a lot of friends, but want more. If there is a new kid, it would give them the chance to make some friends and meet new people. Therefore, doing this can change a students life.\nMy third reason is so students can find a new hobby. On the one hand, some students have plenty of hobbies. On the other hand, some students don't have any hobbies. However, most students have one to five hobbies, which is a fair amount. For the ones that don't think they have enough hobbies, this a great way to help. Also, this could help some students figure out what they want their profession to be.\nIn conclusion, I agree that principals should force students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find themselves a new hobby. Students don't get nearly enough exercise in gym class. It's always good for everyone to make new friends. Also, you can never have to many hobbies. Doing this is good for everybody, even the staff. The staff members that participate will be working more hours, therefore, they would be getting paid even more money. If you think I'm right and made some good points, then show this to someone that can make this a thing in schools near you.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "The school principle has decided that all students must participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. I think this is a great idea and will benefitÂ many people. This would make students more active better member of society and brighten the students future in life. It would benefit the school and sports teams as well by having smarter hard working students.\nSchools have a lot of hardworking students but also have students who dont care and dont contribute to the school or themselves, making students participate in a sport, work on the year book, or serve on the student council would fix that. By making a student play sport you would make them work towards something out of school instead of just laying around, which would make the student a harder worker and benefit his grades. The sport would help the student have better ability to work with other people also giving them new friends to have fun with making school a more enjoyable place. Sports would also help the student become more healthy physically. Working on the yearbook or serving on the student council would benefit the student and the school in many ways such as giving students the opportunities to use there talants, and ideas to make the school a better place. Students could use there skills writing and putting pictures together or develope them while working on the yearbook. Serving on the student council, students could make changes to the school to better it for themselfs and others.\nI agree with this idea for the stuents and the school. It would make the students helthier, hardworking, get better grades,and express there ideas and talants. This is a great idea and more schools should do the same thing.",

        "The principal, of the school, thinks that every student should participate in one or more extracurricular activities.\nThere are lots of students that would like this very much, and others wont be as thrilled if this is to come.\nSome students might not be able to participate in these activities, but will have to do them if they are required by the school, some students might have other sports outside of school, or students parents might want them home after school,and some just might not like what the school has to offer. Students shouldn't have to participateÂ in extracurricular activities.\nMost teenagers now, participate in sports or other activities in there everyday life, so it might be a lot harder to manage school, an after school activity, and a sport outside of school. One of my friends has soccer practice everyday after school, so she has to leave school early to get there on time, but if she had to stay after school she would miss soccer practice, or she might level early and miss her after school activity. No matter what she does she will still miss one of them, but if she didn't have to stay after school she wouldn't have to miss practice or get in trouble for not showing up after school.\nParents might want there children home as soon as possible because they might have a younger child at home that isn't old enough to stay home alone or might not be responsible enough, so if they have an older sibling that can take care of them, they will take the opportunity. As an example*, I have a younger sibling at home who gets out of school around 30Â minutes before me, and my mom dose notÂ like it when shes home alone so when I come home from school I have to stay home until my mom comes home. Most of my friends have younger siblings, so if we all had to stay after school we would have to let our younger siblings stay home alone and our parents might not like that. Another thing parents might want there children home for is chores, if students stay after school they will have less time at home and wont have have time to complete all of there chores or get their homework done, plus some students may have sports or other activities so they would have even less time.\nThen there are the students like me, who dont have any interest in sports or talking in front of random people, students who do this will have to participate in sorts and work on teams and will most likely put little to no effort in what there doing and are only doing it because it is required by the school. Some students may like to play sports and make yearbooks but they might not like the sports the school has to offer or they might not like the people on the team, so again they might put very little effort in to what there doing. Others might just not be good at sports and prefer to read or draw rather then run around, throwing and catching stuff.\nIf students want to join a club or activity they should feel its because they want to and not because the school is making them do so, students should have freedom over joining extracurricular activities. All in all I believe that it would be better if the principal does not make extracurricular activities required.",

        'Students should be told to do at leastÂ one extracurricularÂ at school because doing an extracurricular can help students become more physically healthy, they can leave a lasting impression on their school and they can meet new people. All these can come from doing an extracurricular activity after school. I agree with this decision by the principal since most pupils will have good outcomes by doing an extracurricular activity. Students have a wide range of choices for their activity for example, students could choose to participate in sports such as baseball or basketball, work in the math club, the model U.N.\nAll the clubs you can think of the school most likelyÂ provides for their students to choose, however out of all the good reasons to force students to participate in these extra activities do have some setbacks. Some of these setbacks include the fact that maybe some students have responsibilities after school such as babysitting, jobs or religious reasons.\nFirst, Students who choose to be apart of clubs such as the Student Government or National Junior Honor Society can revolutionizeÂ their school and create change in rules that they do not favor as much as other rules. These clubs usually encourage free thinkers and people who wanna to create change and revitalize their school when it gets a little stale and boring. Some kids might join a sports team or musical ensemble and win a championship or a musical trophy that the school can proudly display like all the other trophies that the school has won. Most schools are very proud of their pupil\'s accomplishmentsÂ in or out of school usually displaying their accomplishments such as their students who went to the NBA like Kobe Bryant or became very famous actors like Tom Cruise.\nNelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the key to life and happiness"" and if that is true partially extracurricular can help you achieve that. As most colleges look at your application form they look at your Grades ACT and SAT but what they also look at is what extracurricular you are in such as clubs, sports teams or musical acts such as a band or ensemble.\nNext, students can become more physically healthy and fit when doing some activities after school. The main example of that is a school sports team that the students can join like track or swimming can help them lead a healthy lifestyle and lose weight while filling their requirements to do a school extracurricularÂ activity. These school sanctioned activities can help students become more fit and lose weight because of the sport. Sports in general are a good way to teach kids to be healthy and not sit at home all day and lay in bed or on a couch all day after school. Kids are easily impressionable to anything or anyone that tells them what they like such as a junk food commercial or a commercial for sugary cereal, these commercials tell them that the cereal that they are marketing is healthy but in reality it is just a sugary full of carbohydratesÂ cereal. By letting kids stay after and teaching them what foods are healthy for them or not we can reduce the impact that childhood obesity has caused the last couple of years.\nLastly, most students who participate in after schoolÂ activities can meet a lotÂ of new people who are interested in the same things as you are and you can talk to them in the clubs or other activities you have joined. Most people who join clubs are often interested in the same things as everyone else in that club, there even some clubs just about certain interests such as the anime club which is just a club for kids who like anime or manga. Other clubs and extracurricular are also good places to meet new people if you are new to a school and need people to talk to.\nthese friends you make can become lifelong friends of yours even out of school and into college or the workforce and adulthood. These bonds that you make in middle school and high schoolÂ can increase your social skills and help you with life skills like communication with other people, a skill needed in jobs like marketing where you most likely need to present in frontÂ of other people sometimes including your boss.\nIn conclusion, being told to do one extracurricular by your school isn\'t the end of the world you can make it fun by choosing a club or sport that you enjoy to do and it will not be a burden on you or your family. In these extra activities you can create a better you and show your school that, you can become healthier and you can always meet new people who share common interests with you. All the students are required to do an extracurricular most likely because the school just wants the best for you and your academic career whether that is from K-12 or beyond to college and the workforce extracurricular help you in many ways throughout your life, these clubs ensembles and teams can boost your self confidence, fortify your social skills while you have fun since you have chosen things that interest you and are not boring.',

        "There has always been extracurricular activities being offered in schools, even in my old house in Generic_City, but many students don't take advantage of these resources given to them. This is why I believe that students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. I make this claim for three reasons, the first of which being that students are more involved in the community that the school built around them. My second reason is that students doing sport related activities helps with exercise and having the need to stay in shape for the team and the school. Last but not least, my third reason is that students that may not have many friends could use these activities as a way to get to know people that are doing the same sport or are in the same band. So I believe that these extracurricular activities would be beneficial not only to the students but the school as a whole.\nFor my first reason I stated that doing an extracurricular activity helps students get involved in a community that was created around them. Students that join sports or other activities provided usually get to know others that participate in the same team or group that the student does. Another reason to back up my claim is that in clubs or competitive sports teams these students generally train together and help each otherÂ succeed in the task that they are working towards achieving. I believe that these activities would help tremendously with letting students get to know each other and further strengthening the schools community.\nMy second claim is that doing extracurricular sports help students get exercise that generally they would not get, had they not been told to do any exercise outside of school. If these students play for a school team (football, wrestling, etc.) there is intense training involved that from, personal experience, is not easy. Im not saying to go run a mile or anything but these sports try to get every competitor in great condition in order to get students to succeed in tournaments and bouts or matches against other teams. So there is a huge exercise component to most sport related activities.\nFor my third reason, let's start with a small story. So, imagine that there is a student that moves around every two to four years. it was pretty difficult to make friends so he generally stayed at home playing video gamesÂ by himself and didn't really go out at all. That was me until around three years ago and doing sports like wrestling and rugby have helped me make friends. So I understand how difficult it is to always be the new kid but these activities let me make friends and get to know people. Students that do these activities usually make friends with the people that have the same interests in activities.\nI believe that enforcing this rule would be beneficial not only to the school but the students as well and these reasons are why I believe in this rule. Communities get built around the students when they do these extracurricular activities. Physical fitness is also a big motivator for a few students with sports related activities. And last but not least, these students can make friends in these activities like I did when I used to move around a lot. Extracurricular activities would be a good service to enforce in schools.",

        "According to recent surveys, around 86% of students participate in extracurricular activities. Students playing sports or being in the year book club has been very beneficial for them. They can learn a lot from the activities, as well as representing the school. Participating in an extracurricular activity should be a requirement for the following reasons: Students will learn something new, students will gain life skills, and the school will see growth in their sport teams.\nFirst, students will learn something new. Not all students have participated in an extracurricular activity. Students who haven't done so, will be taught something they didn't know how to do. When I was in the sixth grade, a couple of my friends and I tried out for something we had never done before. We tried out for the middle school lacrosse team. We learned a lot from our coach and went from not knowing how to catch the ball, to being pretty decent at the sport. Not only can students learn something new, they can also gain life skills.\nSecond, students will learn life skills. Students will learn to show commitment, leadership, and responsibility. My father was a really good soccer player in high school and college. He tells me all the time about the three most important things: commitment, leadership, and responsibility. He also made it very important that I knew about the hardships of being on a travel team like he was on. He had to commit to playing soccer in all of his spare time, always practicing, he had to show leadership and get all the practices and games and help those in need, lastly, he had to show responsibility by making it to all the practices and games on time and prepared. This is why students will learn life skills. Not only can students benefit from extracurricular activities, the school can as well.\nThird, the school will see a growth of students coming to the school. These numbers help the school earn rewards and more money. When people see a school earning a bunch of rewards, they tend to switch to that school if they are in the same activity that is winning rewards. When the school gets more recognition, they will tend to get better players and will keep gaining rewards. One of my friends used to go to the same school as me but then he went to another school that had a better football team and was known for winning the division title. That school has gotten a ton of people to go to their school because of an extracurricular activity. This why the school will see a growth of students going to their school.\nHowever, others believe that students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity. They also say that students shouldn't have to be tied to school any longer than they already are. This wrong for several reasons: students will gain knowledge and life skills from these activities, students will have fun doing so, and students won't be at school for much longer than the normal school day. These activities are not just there to torture the students, they are there to help them excel and grow as a person. The activities will also prepare the students for the rest of their lives.\nIn conclusion, it should be a requirement for students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students will learn something new, students will learn life skills, and the schools will see a growth of numbers in the activities available. These are reasons why students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. I hope that you will think about participating in an extracurricular activity.",

Sports can also make you more active by it being fun to the students. Students can also be active by helping the community around them such as recycling or donating.

By making encouragingÂ there kids to have a open mind about after schoolÂ activitiesÂ they could also find out what there schools offer and possibly the parents could be interested.

When the students come home from there extracurricular activities they could tell there parents all about it and maybe teach there parents something they dont know.\nWhen you sign up or good to a after schoolÂ activity try and go with at leastÂ one friend who is also interested in the same topic. This will give you a safe feeling and you will have someone to share the fun with you! Not only will you have one friend there but if you bring a friend there is a 100% chance you will make more friends there.

For all you know you could have found a career you love and want to do as a job.

        "Do you want to be forced to work on something? No one does and if a school makes you do an extracurricular activity thats whats going to happen. If we have activities in school, then the after schoolÂ activity would have to be after school. There is a reason why we have P.E, FACS, coding, and stuff like that. We have those classes so that we dont have to do after schoolÂ activity.\nThe first reason why students shouldnt have to do extracurricular activities is because they could already be doing and activity. Whether its Babysitting siblings, playing with toys at home, playing video games, doing sports, or even doing a cooking class. Those are good activities, and even better, its an activity that they like. what if the student doesnt like any of the activity choices given to them. That could be bad for the child. Its like making a person eat when their full already, And to add onto this, The child could also be going somewhere already like out to eat, going to their moms house, dads house, friends house or a restaurant\nAnother reason schools shouldnt make kids do extracurricular activities is because after a long day of school or work you want to just chill and sit down, listen to relaxing music, drink soda, eat food, and all that good stuff. What if your school took away that time from you? That wouldnt be that great because then you have no down time. another thing you could do in this free time is study, do homework, and even work on some other stuff. this time could give student more time to complete and understand their homework. This would make the student more focus and responsive during class.\nThe last reason I have for disagreeing with making kids participate in extracurricular activities isÂ because the kids pick up time would change. some parents that go to work everyday get sleepy. they want to sleep after work just like the child does after school. parents get sleepy fast and thats because they have a lot to deal with. If schools dont do this, than the after school stuff wont be a problem. another reason is because the parent could be working afternoon hours the day that the child has to be picked up. Then the parent is going to freak out and try to get someone to get the child for you. the next reason is because the parent doseÂ notÂ have enough time to pick up the chi;d. and the last reason is because maybe you dont have the money to drive miles to you son or daughtersÂ school.\nIn Conclusion, if schools dont make kids do extracurricular activities, then none of this will happen. So I say we should save the troubles and just not do it. Treat people how you want to be treated. I think this is mean to the children because I feel like the children should have a say in what they want to do.",

        "I think having students participate in extracurricular activities is a great idea. Having students participate in extracurricular activities is very beneficial for your mental and physical health and has many advantages to the students participating.\nOne reason why being involved in extracurricular activities benefits you is because it's overall good for you. It can build time management which is a really important skill to have as an adult. Another skill you need to have is good social skills, and being around the other people in your activity helps build social skills. When you have good social skills talking to people and being social builds your self esteem and confidence and your mental health is just as important.\nParticipating in these extracurricular activities is actually really helpful for your future. Colleges love to hear you've done extra things. Even if you dont plan on going to college the extracurricular activities help you shape your life and see what you would like to do. School activities also help you figure out your interests and figure out who you are and who you want to be as an adult.\nSpeaking of figuring out who you are, being involved in extracurriculars helps build character. You can make friends with the same interests and hobbies. Sometimes, people dont know who they are and doing these extracurricular activities helps a lot because you can find your interests and your personality.\nIn conclusion, the principle should have all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Its good for your health, its beneficial for your future, and it builds character. Extracurricular activities are very beneficial because they exercise your mind and body.",

        "Students may not always make the best decisions,but we still chose what we wanted to do whether it would affect us or not. We don't make all of the decisions, because we have parents, guardians, and sometimes teachers to help us stay on the right track. However, if a person is in a spot where they could control what we do,like a principal, than their decisions could make things a whole lot worse or better. If our principal forces us to do an extracurricular activity, than I would say\nNo!\nThe reason why is because, We might get stuck with an activity that we've never done, We might have to miss it because of other important matters, and finally if we miss it, we would have to deal with the repercussions\nFirst things first, we have an extracurricular activity that we might not know or be familiar with at all. If the principal just assigned everyone to a random extracurricular activity(lets assume that thats what happened and that we could notÂ change it.) than the chances of people particularly knowing that activity go down by a lot. If you are not a type of kid who hates to run around, or, you have asthma and you can't run,what if he accidentally enrolls you into the soccer club. You go up and tell the instructor that you can't run and they say, thats fine, but, the principal will be somewhat mad that you can't do the program. \"\"I guess i'll ask himÂ to get you a different one this time.\"\"Or what if you get stuck with a game like cricket. It is extremely hard to learn how to play that game, and it also is super hard for newcomers. If you were stuck with something like that, than you are not going to have fun with it.\nNext one up, The game that you cannot show up for (After school activities).Lets say that you were chosen to be on the student council and you have a meeting after school. UnfortunatelyÂ you have a therapists appointment after school at the same time. Will the principal force you too stay or will he let you go like he should do. You might have soccer practice for the junior league championship game that is coming up but you have to sit in a chair and talk about the budget for the Shrek junior play instead. It just would'nt work out with allÂ of the problems, and also the fact that all kids are different and that they should'nt be forced to stay after and miss something important because of their extracurricular activity after school. I just feel like they should let us do what we need to do after school and not bother us with after school extracurricular activities.\nLast things last, The cruel and unusual punishments for missing these extracurricular activities. The principal would punish those who either missed his extracurriculars or made a fuss about them. it would usually range from detention to having to eat lunch in another room. However, if you miss 3 after school curriculars than he would call your parents, 6 he would suspend you, and 10 or more he would expel you, (Permanently). He did do a good job of enforcing his rules too. He has resource officers and they will tell the principal if you have been missing out on his after school activities. The principal really is no joke, so i recommend stayingÂ on his nice list. Even though I still don't agree with him at all for doing this.\nIn Conclusion, No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might, and besides, thats just my opinion and i'm just a kid so what do I know. All i know that it is time to wrap up everything here and it is time for me too leave. I will be taking my leave now,it was surprisingly fun while it lasted, alright, enough with the dawdling see you later, I guess.",

        'As I walk around the corner I\'m greeted with hey, what\'s up, smiles, and ""Generic_Name!"" by my teammates.\nThis was every day I walked in the team room for basketball practice. I have so many memories and unforgettable moments from my basketball season and I made many friends. Yesterday I was greeted by Generic_Name, one of the three seniors from basketball,""Hey Generic_Name!"" she said with a big smile as she walked back to softball practice. Basketball season ended a month ago, but the team bond and relationships continue on. Everyone should have the amazing experience I did of being involved in an extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal\'s decision for all students to participate in one after schoolÂ activity because of the importance to our school community, building character, and the lasting impact.\nParticipating in after school activities is important to our school community as a whole. Within a school, positive relationships are key to a beneficial education as well as experience for each student. Throughout extracurricular activities students build relationships with others through common interests. Such as through sports, you develop a relationship with your team. You crave to get out on the court or field to play the game you both love and look forward to seeing each and everyone of your teammates.\nParticipation in programs will help to develop and build the character of each student. Students exercise real life skills that are needed for the workplace. Each program is centered around teamwork which requires collaboration, communication, and compromising which are key components of many jobs. Other skills developed within these programs include leadership by demonstrating through example and time-managementÂ skills by deadlines for assignments. Getting involved in a programÂ may spark your interest in a future career such as a reporter, lawyer, or a political figure.\nExtracurricular activities have a lasting impact. The word impact is a two sided word, it is not only what we are impacted by it is who we impact as well. Each program is made up of a diverse group of students from different backgrounds bringing different perspectives. Everyone has a story to share of their journey, we are inspired by others stories and impacted by their personalities and action they take. Each story or action has a different impact, perhaps the desire to change the world or to look at something with a new perspective. The relationships and inspiration sparked by after schoolÂ programs have a two-sided impact.\nI agree with our principal and believe that every student should participate in an after school program because of the impact sparked by relationships and the development of many skills. Whether it is tennis or serving on the student counsel, I encourage you to get involved in an after school activity because it will no doubt bring more energy and joy to your life. There are a sea of options to choose from. Take a little time from your day to check out the bulletin board beside the main office to view the after school activities posted there. I promise you will not regret it; it will change your life and world for the better.',

        "I think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and i completely agree with the principal. Students might not have any plans after school, but what would be better than being in a after school club with a group of your peers. Or for athletic students they could be on one of the sports teams. Having students be in a extracurricular activity is a win-win in every situation. I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it could help students with their school work, it can be a opportunity for students to become more social and make new friends, and it could help students get to know the school and staff and make the school a better learning environment.\nSome students might need help in some of their classes. So because of that reason they could be in an extracurricular club like study hall or homework club. Students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. If a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. Sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. These are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes.\nBy being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people. Some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school. They could meet those who they share common interest like video games for example and could bond over those things. Or people who like sports and like to talk about sports. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for students to bond and get to know the people they go to school with.\nBeing in these extracurricular activities students can get to know the school and staff better and make their school a better learning environment for themselves and others. Some students might not know a lot of information about the school they're attending. But with these activities students can connect with their teachers and staff on a deeper level and get to know them more. This could also help them in the classroom. By knowing more about their school they could contribute to making their school a better learning, safe, and fun environment to be in. This is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment.\nI think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and it should be implemented into the school. There are a lot of great things and opportunities coming from this decision. It can help students more than just academically. It can also help them socially. They can connect more with their school and make it a better place. In conclusion these are the reasons I agree with the principal and I think all students should be in at least one extracurricular activity.",

I disagree with his decision because some students may not have time, no one to take them, or not enough money.\nStudents may not have enough time to do everything they need to do and go somewhere. Sometimes they have to finish their studying, homework, and go to a game or practice. They could also have a job or have to help out on a farm. For example, I had so much homework and studying to do, but I could not get it all done and go to practice. As a result I stayed home and did my homework and studying instead of going to practice. Because I did not have enough time, I could not do an extracurricular activity.\nSome students do not have someone to take them to games and practices. Their parents may not be able to take them because they work late or they have to go somewhere after work. One time my mom had to work late but, I also had cheer practice. Because I had no one to take me to practice, I had to stay home and miss a practice.\nSome times students can not participate because their families do not have enough money.

        "An extracurricular activity by nature is designed to be optional, something that students can join to support their hobby. Sports are a popular example, because if you are enrolled in the school, you don't have to spend extra money to join a sports team. This is great news for the people interested in all the sports their school has to offer. But not everyone wants to join the sports team. Even if you take into account all the other extracurricular activities at school, there will still be people who aren't interested in any of them, and it would be impossible to cover all categories and hobbies of every student at school to make an activity for each of them. This is why I believe the ability to opt out of an extracurricular activity is a fundamental part of the activity itself, hence the \"\"extra\"\" in the name, and I'm going to tell you why forcing students to participate in one is a very bad idea.\nLet's say for this example we single out one particular student, and this student's name is Generic_Name. Let's also say that Generic_Name has a hobby of creating and collecting model airplanes, to display on the shelf of his room. Generic_Name's hobby isn't a very common one, but that's okay. He prefers to build them alone, in the quiet of his room, and maybe share pictures of them online with another small group of model airplane enthusiasts. Generic_Name chooses to spend most of his free time doing this, and he enjoys it. Unless he can't, because the school just made that choice for him, and now Generic_Name has to sign up for an extracurricular activity. Generic_Name's school doesn't have a model airplane building club, as most schools don't, so Generic_Name is forced to spend his free time doing something he doesn't enjoy. He barely has any time to invest into his real hobby anymore, since he has to spend all afternoon at the chess club. As his happiness plummets, so do his grades. The school has nothing to really gain, and certainly a lot to lose, by implementing this system.\nThis leads me to my next point, which is also a question. What does the school gain by putting this rule in place? What benefits does the school get by forcing each and every student to participate in an extracurricular activity? Are they not taking into account the amount of protests to this rule, or the amount of students who will skip the extracurricular activity anyway? What could make them want to introduce this rule so badly, that they would ignore all of the negative consequences that come with it? There is no reason that I can think of that could support this rule even being thought of. A rule like not being allowed to chew gum at school, while pretty silly, still has a reason. It's so that students won't stick their chewed gum underneath the table, and while I would never do something like that, I still completely understand and can get behind this rule. This is in stark contrast to a rule like forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity, where I couldn't think of a single reason for it's existence.\nAll in all, I think adding this rule to any school would only lead to disaster. It only brings negative consequences to both involved parties, and if there are any schools already with this rule, they would most certainly be better off without it. There isn't a single reason I can think of for a rule like this to be made. These are all the reasons why I think forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is a very bad idea.

Why should a student be forced into an activity when they have chores? what about the amount of extra stress? Plus, sports and yearbook aren't everyone's favorite thing.\nAs stated before, some kids don't have time for things like activities. A student might have to babysit a sibling, do chores, work around the house, or even have a job!\nThere's no reason for making extra activities mandatory. Meetings early in the morning? Less sleep for growing children. After school? There's enough at home to handle. Even the middle of class wouldn't work, as the student would fall behind.\nNot only will it mess up a kids schedule, it'll cause stress. Life can be stressful for students. Especially when dealing with tests, quizzes, and changes to the student. Add in an activity that'll cause them to have less distressing time and you'll have a meltdown waiting to happen. You can't expect a student to be able to handle that. If students actively pick an activity to do, it's because they know they can handle the time management.\nAnd finally, Not everyone is going to be interested. Sure, the students might be cool with it for the first week, but then it'll be bothersome and annoying. Activities should be optional, not mandatory. It takes the fun out of everything. Whether you let the students pick or not, it won't matter. Not everyone wants to join the sports team. Not everyone wants to work for the yearbook. Some people would prefer going home and relaxing at the end of the day.\nWhile it seems like a good idea, mandatory participation should't be a thing. Most kids are trying to spend time with family, not giving them time to do sports. Some people might already be stressing over tests and grades, causing more stress in activities. And let's not forget that not everyone would be interested in kicking a ball around or painting. It may be for the best, but it's also the worst to make activities mandatory.",

I think that requiring everybody to have an extra curricular would be too demanding. There are also more reasons why I disagree with the principle. I will be writing about the reasons that I disagree with the principle.\nSome kids don'd do extra curricular activities because they have stuff home and family related. Some kids wouldn't have a ride back home from these activities. Now, I know that your thinking, \"\"Can't they ask their friends?\"\" But honestly, is there every friend for every person who doesn't have a ride? Why do you think there is a such thing as a taxi now? And some children, including myself, live farther away than most kids in their school. Not many parents are willing to drive far away for a child that isn't theirs. Also, there are some religions that do certain rituals on a daily basis, at certain times. Like prayers, or temple visits, etc: Some children just have a bed time. So not every one could make it to these activities.\nA lot of children that do after school activities have homework and chores to do when they come home. There would be a less likely chance of these getting done, if everybody had an after school activity. Some kids struggle while they are at school, and they use their time at home to study and try to help gain their academic skills. If they are like me, a lot of kids can't really focus at school and usually finish projects and stuff of that sort at home. Some children just can't balance school and extra curricular activities and either stop doing the activity, or lack academically.\nAlong with the other things that I mentioned, some parents/guardians of the students can't afford the extra things that go along with doing these activities. For example: A lot of boys could play sports like basketball and football, but there are expenses to these things. You have to buy helmets, knee pads, shoulder pads, shoes, socks, food for games, and practice attire. Even things other than sports require paying something. Things like art supplies, musical instruments, money for costumes or outfits. There are some after school activities that don't require money, but most do. I have met a majority of kids' parents that just don't want to pay the money for the sport that their child wants to do.\nThese are some of the reasons that I disagree with the principle. They are valid and practical. I'm thinking about the many reasons why kids don't do after school activities and why it is important to understand these kinds of situations. I have met many kids who has wanted to do a sport, but can't because of a valid reason, like the ones I have listed. You have to take into consideration why everyone isn't doing an extra curricular activity now, and be satisfied with the ones that try and/or do.Â Â",

      essay:
        "Most schools have extracurricular activities, such as playing sports or working on the yearbook. Most students enjoy these activities and are grateful to have the chance to participate in them. In the majority of schools, a student is not required to take part in one of these activities. However, if the principal of a school were to decide that all students must participate in one, then their decision should be supported because the extracurricular activities will help students find new interests, they will allow them to meet people with similar interests, and skills such as teamwork will be encouraged.\nOne reason in support of a principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities is that they help people find new interests. Often times, a student may assume that a certain activity is boring or a waste of their time. However, this is impossible to know until it is tried out. After trying it out, the student may realize that it is fun, and a great way to spend their free time. Sometimes, a student may simply think that they do not have the time to participate in a club or a sport after school. However, after doing it once and realizing how much they enjoy the activity, they may reconsider whether or not they do not have much time. Both of these scenarios result in the student having a good time, and this enjoyment can only be credited to the principal, as they are the reason why the student participated in an activity. So, by being forced to be in a club or sport, students will expand their amount of hobbies and interests.\nAnother reason why the principal made a good decision is that it will allow students to meet those with similar interests. If everyone has to do an extracurricular activity, they will all go to the one that they are most interested in. For example, those who like taking photos may go to yearbook club. Now, all of those who have the same hobbies are together, and they will most likely become friends, as they can bond over their interests. This was only possible because of the principal's decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities.\nThe last reason why the decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities was a good one is that it encourages skills, such as teamwork or persistence. In most sports, such as basketball or soccer, teamwork is a skill that is always used. The players must communicate with each other to make the best play. They must encourage each other, and keep them from getting nervous. Teamwork will also be used when students grow up. Many jobs will require employees to work in a team to complete their work. By practicing this skill earlier, students will be better prepared for when they grow up. Another skill that is encouraged is persistence. If one gives up after facing a problem, no work can get done. For example, if one is taking part in a mathematics club, they will have to solve a variety of problems. Some may seem like they have no solution. However, if the student gives up after they cannot find a solution, they will not learn anything. Also, they will be ill-prepared for when they grow up and face a myriad of other challenges. If, when they face these challenges, they just give up, they will not be able to do all they are supposed to do. By participating in extracurricular activities, students will not grow up without these skills, and can instead accomplish everything they need to, and more. The one who is responsible for this is the principal, who made students take part in these activities.\nIn conclusion, a principal's decision to require students to participate in extracurricular activities is a good one because students will find new interests, make new friends, and build skills that are absolutely necessary in adult life. By taking part in these activities, students will both enjoy themselves, and they will gain the skills needed throughout their life.Â",

        "Frisbee, video games, art, coding, cooking, and soccer are only some of the many options of extracurricular activities that you can take part in. Extracurricular activities require no sign upÂ and no prerequisite, which is great for new students, for they can do it even if they have no prior skills or knowledge related to the activity. I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows students to socialize and collaborate with their peers, as well as meet people with the same interests. All while doing an activity they enjoy.\nTaking part in an after schoolÂ or extracurricular activity lets you socialize and collaborate with friends you may already have, or students that you haven't met yet.Â EitherÂ way it's a great way to have fun and build a better relationship with your peers. Communication and collaboration skills are some of the most important skills in life. Going to extracurricular activities lets you practice and use those skills. Additionally, when students work with peers they share the knowledge and skills that they already have with each other, so in addition to what they're learning in the activity, they are learning new things from each other.\nExtracurricular activities give students the chance to meet people with the same interests;\nattending one or more of these activities allows students to engage with one another.\nThis is good because some students can be shy when trying to make new friends because they can't start a conversation.\nExtracurricular activities gives students that are more shy the opportunity to talk to one another and begin a friendship, because meeting people with the same interests as yourself are a lot easier to talk to. This can all happen while playing a game of chess, basketball, or other extracurricular activities.\nIn conclusion, the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity should be a simple decision because these activities are a great way to practice life skills like communication and collaboration. As well as the perfect place to meet people with the same interests. This will also provide students who are more shy the opportunity to talk to their peers, make friends, and create friendly relationships with the people around them. Therefore, I believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they aren't forced to.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Many students play a sport or are involved with an activity such as a club, student council, and even NJHS (National Junior Honors Society) as well as other in school or outside of school activities. Most students go home everyday and relax the whole time and don't feel the need to exercise or do anything. This can start to take affect on their health and mental well being or even cause them to not care about school as much as to say someone who plays a sport for their school and attends clubs after school. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity or multiple activities of their choice for the benefit of their health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about.\nPlaying a sport is a healthy and enjoyable thing to add to your life. Sports help increase your endurance, muscle tone, overall health, and even helps you lose weight. Students who play sports tend to be less tired during the day and are much healthier than say a student who stays inside all day and doesn't play outside with friends or plays a sport. By adding a sport to your life, it gives you plenty of exercise and workouts each day and allows you to keep in shape and stay healthy.\nWhen school is over, many students only think about how they're going to relax that day or what they're going to eat as soon as they get home. Most students don't really have much to do the rest of their day and often get bored most days after school. By doing an extracurricular activity such as a sport or club, it allows you to eliminate that boredom and have something to do either everyday or at least a few times a week. You can have something to look forward to everyday at least and can do something you love instead of sitting on the couch waiting for tomorrow to come. It's best to choose an activity you really like, by doing something you love, it makes it both enjoyable and makes you feel less stressful since it's an activity you really like and enjoy.\nSome students find school very challenging or have mental disabilities that prevent them from easily completing school and gives them challenges they have to figure out how to overcome. School clubs such as homework clubs or even clubs that are dedicated to a specific subject or idea can help a student really understand the content they're learning about and help make it easier to focus in class and not struggle as much. Clubs that are dedicated to certain ideas or subjects often learn more about that subject or idea because of the fact that it mainly focuses on specific content or a wide range of data related to a certain genre. By joining a club, you immediately learn more than you would in a class because it's a more open learning environment and different people share their knowledge instead of maybe 1 teacher.\nI do agree that our principal should make all students participate in an extracurricular activity because of the benefits for your health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about. Everyone should find an activity they love to do and add it to their life to benefit them even if it's multiple activities.",

The school has some choices for extracurricular activities such as sports, year book, and student council.\nThere are not many selections that are available for them.\nFor example, if a student doesn't have a favorite choice, then they would be forced to choose something they don't favor.\nThat would diminish their view towards school and the principal.\nThe school can create more choices for the students to pick from, and it could make a difference.\nLast, participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because many students already participates in some kind of extracurricular activities outside of school. Extracurricular activities such as swimming which is not possible to be done in school.\nI think schools should focus on the main subjects such as Math, Science, and English, and not extracurricular activities.\nEven if there are extracurricular activities in school, there should be a choice for it.\nIn conclusion, the principal's idea of all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because not every students like extracurricular activity, there are not aÂ varietyÂ of activities to choose from, and some students already participates in an extracurricular activities outside of school.\nExtracurricular activities should be a choice not a must.\nI hope the principal uses my ideas to make the extracurricular activities more suitable for the students.Â Â",

My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision because students would get more experience inÂ school, they would become more productive, and parents would have more time to work.\nOne reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because students would gain experience from it. If students participate in extracurricular activities they could gain experience from the the things they learned and the mistakes they made. For example, I am part of The Ambassadors Club, and this program has taught me how to manage my time, how to work with other people, and how to efficiently get work done, which I will need as I'm growing up. Students would get new experience if they participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\nAnother reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it will help the students become more productive. Most students at home have nothing to do, so they fill that time up by going on their phones, playing video games, or getting into trouble. One example would be myself because I am lazy, and I love to procrastinate. I would usually get my work done last minute, and I would always do the bare minimum. So, I decided to join a club at school, and I chose Drama Club. The club was very fun and exciting, and I learned a lot of new acting skills. Ever since I joined the Drama Club I have stopped procrastinating, and I have been more productive in school and at home. I believe that if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity they would be become more productive and would stay out of trouble.\nMy last reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it would give their parents more time to work. Many students have parents who work long hours, and their parents might have to hire a babysitter or might have to enroll their child into daycare, which both are very expensive. Parents might not have enough money to provide their children with a babysitter or day care, so they have to get off work early so they can take care of their child/children. For example, my sister, who goes to the same school as me, comes home at around 2:30 pm, but my parents don't come home until around 4:00 pm. So our parents had to hire a babysitter, but all of the babysitters were to expensive, so our parents had to get off of work early just to take care of her and to make sure that she is safe. After a month of leaving work early, my mom signed my sister up for Step Team, which my sister says is really fun. Now my parents don't have to leave work early because of the extra hour and a half that my sister is at Step Team. If students participate in at least one extracurricular activity their parents would be able to work more, and they would be able to earn more money to provide for their children.\nAll in all, parents would have more time to work, students would be more productive, and they would get more experience if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. However, some people might think the new system is bad because students would want to relax or hang out with friends, but I believe that their are a lot more positive effects if students participate in an extracurricular activity. In conclusion, with this new system many parents will benefit from it, and many students will benefit from the new system as well.",

        "So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason. Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason. Not to be on the electronics all day that would'nt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives becauseÂ you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people would'nt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport.\nReason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too.\nReason number two everyone should do something in there lives should'nt be lazy because that would'nt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lotÂ of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason.\nReason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. won't have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time you'll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play.\nThats all my reason I hope that a lotÂ of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life is'nt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment. So thats all I have to say about being a leader not a follower like do something once again u only live once make ur life go big. Â",

The principal wants all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activitys. Here are some reasons I agree to having extracurricular activitys for all students. For, it can help build social skillls, it can give students a chance to exercise, and can decrease boredem and stress.\nTo begin with, building social skills is an good way to make new friends for example, you can make new friends by joinging new clubs, meeting new people such as coaches, and learing and sharing new ideas between people in your activity. Some students may be shy when it comes to new people; joining clubs like bookclub and art is a great way to find people that has the same interest as you.\nNext, many students may want a chance to exercise by joining sports. Joining different sport teams can help with exercise for example, track can increase your cardiovascular indurance and build your speed. Using sport activitys can teach students how to exercise and how to be healthy.\nAlso, students may want to join extracurricular activitys to decrease boredem and stress. Joining these activitys can get your head out of stressing situations. Say you failed a test you would not feel so great afterwards but to get your mind out of it you can go to your extracurricular class and study more for your next test of get you mind off things. Serving as student council can decrease boredem by setting up school dances and a bunch of other fun activitys.\nHowever, some students may disagree and not want to participate in extracurricular activitys due to being lazy, grades, or behavior. When students are to lazy they tend to skip out on things like sports. Grades are a big part in not being able to join a extracurricular activity due to lack of doing homework, or not participating in class. Behavior in some students may affect them from joining a club too because their mother or father may want them to change their behavior first.\nIn conclusion, I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activitys. For, it can help build their social skillls, students can get chances to exercise, and decrease boredem and stress. These are great ways for students to make new friends and build goals for the future.",

        "Wouldn't it be awesome to always have something to do at the end of a long boring school day. Extracurricular activities give you that chance. I believe that everyone should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity every school year. I think this because of all the benefits. Also, every extracurricular activity has a different advantage. The extracurricular activities I think everyone should be a part of are: sports, academic, and different clubs.\nThe first, and my personal favorite, extracurricular activity is sports teams. Sports teams create a way for kids to get exercise. Kids are recommended to exercise 60 minutes each day. Joining a sports team ensures that you reach that goal. Not only would it be healthy, but the student would feel good about him/herself. Teamwork is also and benefit to joining a sports team. Teamwork is one of the most important skills. It's one of the the only skills people absolutely need to be successful in life. Sports teams are one of the best ways to practice and get better at that skill. Another skill acquired in sports teams is leadership. In sports teams leadership is always a reoccurring skill. You also need to show leadership throughout you life, similar to teamwork. Some may be a bit shy and not necessarily know how to correctly take a lead in situations, but sports teams could definitely fix that.Â To think this is only one of the types of extracurricular activities to choose from, doesn't it already seem worth your time?\nThe next option for an extracurricular activity is the academic workshops you're able to join. Academic workshops and clubs can push students to do better. In these academic workshops you surround yourself with people who want to be better, and are better than you. Surrounding yourself with people who are better than you encourages you to do better for yourself and pride. Academic workshops may also improve your grades a little or a lot depending on how dedicated you are to do so. There are workshops like homework club that help students who need a little more help and guidance than others. If these particular students participate in these types of things, they're sure to see and improvement anytime soon.\nLastly, there are so many different types of clubs any student could be a part of and interested in. Everybody should try something new every once in a while. The different clubs that schools have are the perfect opportunity. I'm going to introduce you to two of the clubs that sparked my interest. First is the yearbook club. Doesn't it just sound fun by its name? Wouldn't you want to be a part of the book that everyone raves about at the end of the year? You get to take pictures, make fun subtitles/caption, and so much more. Sometimes you even get extra credit for it. Seems like a deal breaker to me. Then there'sÂ student council. This is probably my favorite clubs to be a part of. It's very intriguing to see what it's like to be somewhat of a politician. Student council is also an awesome opportunity to show your teamwork and leadership skills strengthened by sports teams. Besides, wouldn't it be fun to basically be at the head of the school. Think about it, these are just two of the hundreds of clubs you're able to choose from.\nI believe every student should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity. Sports teams help push exercise, and strengthen teamwork and leadership. Academic workshops encourage better grades and motivates students to do better. There are also opportunities for student to try new things with the different types of clubs. Think of how well rounded a student would be by participating in one of these extracurricular activities every school year.Â",

Some people don't do extracurricular activitiesÂ because of fear and uncertainty. Avoiding extracurricular activities can have a negative impact on your life. There are many benefits, long term and short term, to doing extracurricular activities. If extracurricular activities are made mandatory, it can help students overcome fears and find things they're passionate about. Making extracurricular activities compulsory for students will help them by creating new friendships, helping them get into collage and giving students new experiences.\nMaking extracurricular activities compulsory will help students make friends and build relationships. Engaging in extracurricularÂ activities will help students find people they have something in common with.

Going to clubs and after school activities will help student meet people they would not usually be friends with and help broaden your perspectives.\nMany students are shy and have a hard time making friends, but if extracurricularÂ activities are made mandatory it will help pull them out if their shells and develop social skills which are incredibly important throughout life. Having all student go to extracurricular activities will also introduce kids to many different types of people so that they have a better view of the world.\nEngaging in extracurricular activities can help you get into a good collage. While collages will look at your grades, they will also look at your extracurricular activities. Collages want not only smart people but also well rounded people who have many interests and will bring something to their school. When I asked my cousin, who goes to Generic_School, about when he applied for collage he said that collages will look at tons of people with good grades but what makes you stand out is your extracurricular activities and the extra things you do. Therefore, if it's mandatory for kids to do extracurricular activities, they will have a higher chance of getting into a good collage and this will help them in the long run.\nTaking part in extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ will give students new experiences. WhetherÂ it's being in an uncomfortable situation or just hanging out with your friends, your experiences are important because they are part of what shapes who you are as a person. If students take part in extracurricular activities, they might even find something they truly enjoy doing. Being in an extracurricular activity will expose students to other ideas and cultures which will in turn broaden their perspectives and make them more empathetic. When I was in sixth grade and I told one of my friends I was vegetarian, she said sorry, looking at me with pity. After a while she learned that I chose to be vegetarian, and that I enjoy it. This changed her perspective on what vegetarians are like and has made her more aware. When you expose kids to ideas, especially controversial ones, it helps them start to formulate their own opinions bases of of what they think and not what others tell them to think. It is very important that all people are exposed to others who are different to themselves and if all students take extracurricular activities, they will benefit through learning about their peers.\nBuilding relationships with people is an important skill that will be used throughout life and extracurricular activities will force students to be in positions where they will make friends. In the long run,Â extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ will help you in many ways such as getting you into a good collage which will eventually help you lead a good life. Taking extra curricular activities will make you a more well rounded and aware person and might even help you discover a passion. On top of this, by taking an extracurricular activity, students will gain new experiences which will broaden their perspectives. It is vital that students are exposed to other cultures and types of people because this will over all help to shape their out look on the world and make them more empathetic human beings. If extracurricular activities become mandatory, students will benefit because, they will make friends, it will help them get into collage, and give students new experiences.",

        "Does your child have a choice between taking an extracurricular activity? Your child may make the decision not to take part in a school activity, but your child should at least take one activity that your kid may enjoy. A student has already 35 hours each week learning about academics, but most of the academics don't teach the student confidence or leadership. There are thousands of different reasons why you should take your child to do an extracurricular activity, and these are some reasons why you must.\nTaking part in a school activity may teach various life lessons that a student may not already know. Life lessons aren't valued as much but it can teach people to do the right thing.

        "Many school officials have been questioning whether or not students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities like sports, working on the yearbook, or serving in the student council can contribute a lot to a student's view on school. In addition to this, students will pay more attention to their grades and behavior. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is a great way for them to learn new things, get a break from learning all day, and get to socialize and make more friends.\nIn school, many students dislike to learn new things. By having one extracurricular activity, students will have a great way of learning new things. Sports are something we usually do during gym class, but in gym class at our school we move fast through any unit that we do.Â Having at least one extracurricular activity will give students a chance to enjoy participating in sports that they like. Also students will get to learn more about this sport and even later on join a team. There are a lot of creative students at my school. Students who want to learn about photography, drawing, and constructing things will have a great opportunity to by joining a extracurricular activity that involves this. I would like to add on that when I joined a drawing club, I learned many new things like blending colors. Additionally, training on your mindset is very important. By having a extracurricular activity like chess or board games, students will get to learn how to play board games that they have been wanting to try. Learning new things from extracurricular activities could be very helpful to students because later on they might have a chance to use this information.\nLearning all day can be very hard on some students. By joining a extracurricular activity, students will be able to have a break from learning all day. Many students by the end of the day are very tired after learning for so long. By participating in an extracurricular activity students will clear their mindset. In addition to this, having a break from learning can make students feel more relieved and they will pay more attention during class. If students decide to join extracurricular activities like drawing, they will be able to calm down. It has been a proven fact that drawing will make you calm down, so by doing a extracurricular activity, students will be at ease and contribute more during class. Learning all day is very stressful and takes a lot of energy, so therefore students should participate in calm and relaxing extracurricular activities that will give them a break from school and at the same time help them pay more attention toward school.\nSocializing is something that some shy students struggle with. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to make more friends and socialize. As a shy person, when I first came to my school I was struggling to find some good friends that I could trust. Later on I decided to join a chess club and a drawing club and I made great friends. Joining a extracurricular activity can give shy students a way to to train on socializing, meaning that they could practice how to socialize and even overcome their fear of socializing by talking to people in their extracurricular activity. At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there. Extracurricular activities are very helpful towards students who want to make some friends and socialize, so therefore making students participate in at least one is necessary.\nStudents should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is very helpful for them. Students get to learn many new things and this might even help them chose their future career. Learning new things can be very tiring to some students and they might not even be able to handle so much information, so by joining a extracurricular activity students will get to have a break from school. To add on, students will will have the chance to socialize and make more friends. Learning can be very difficult for some students, but by participating in at least one extracurricular activity, students will be able to enjoy learning new things, get a break from learning all day, and will get to socialize and make more friends. Therefore students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because this activity will help them with their school life and their grades.

        "Close your eyes and imagine that it is your junior year in high school. You are sitting in a disorganized mess trying to figure out what to put on your college resume before the deadline, which happens to be in exactly two hours. This could have been prevented if you had actually done any extracurricular activities in the past. To prevent these types of scenarios, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can give them future opportunities, make them gain many skills, and help them find a passion to pursue.\nEveryone wants many opportunities in life, and extracurricular activities do just that. If you play an instrument, you can travel abroad to play your favorite pieces. You can join competitions and get recognized so that orchestras and symphonies ask you to play with them. It is not just playing an instrument that can get you opportunities, but sports too. If your team makes championships, you both can travel places for that competition. We cannot forget about college scouts either. If they see you play and they think you are good enough to be on their team, then they could give you a full-ride scholarship to their school. If that is not an amazing opportunity, then I don't know what is.\nThe next reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can learn many valuable skills they will need in the future. In leadership clubs like National Honor Society or your school's student council, you can learn how to communicate with people and get your ideas out. You can also learn to lead people, plan or organize events, and help your community. You can even overcome almost everyone's biggest fear, public speaking. That is definitely a huge benefit. With sports, you can also not only build up your communication skills, but also learn to collaborate by becoming a team player. If you are in a chess club, you can gain patience and critical thinking skills which will definitely help you in the future.\nThe last reason why all students should participate in extracurricular activities is so that they can find a passion to pursue. Sometimes, people do not always know what they want to do or become someday and extracurricularÂ activities just happen to help with that. By doing them, you can find out your interests and hobbies, what you are good and bad at, and what abilities you posses. If you love that sport or that instrument, pursue it! Work harder than anyone, and you just might find yourself in the Olympics. Practice with your whole heart and soul and next thing you know, you could be inviting your family to come see you perform with the National Symphony. The point is, all these passions can start from you just wanting to try out an activity.\nOverall, students should definitely participate in extracurricular activities. These activities can bring you many opportunities, valuable skills, and help you pursue a passion you never knew you had. There are so many more reasons to participate in extracurricular activities, but these are some of the most beneficial ones. If you had chosen any of the hundreds of extracurricular activities available, you would not be frantically trying to finish up your college resume two hours before it is due. Instead, you could have been stress free doing what you love the most.",

        "Many people participate in after school activities. Choosing to do so but some people prefer going home and resting after the long school day. But what if your principal said you have to participate in an extracurricular activity in order to go to this school. This may help you in many ways it could provide a way to talk and socialize with friends or make new ones. If it was a sport that involves any type of moving it would make you more fit and healthy. I would agree with the principals idea it introduces the kids to many things they have not done before and they might not of known they liked it or were good at it.\nThere are many benefits in extracurricular activities that you might not of known. Whether it would help you now or in the future. It is very healthy to participate in any activity because it can help you physically and even mentally improving your ability with your social skills in the result of you talking with your teammates or other people constantly. And how it can help you physically is in basically any sport you play. Your moving around constantly improving your endurance and strength it makes you more fit and healthy.\nWhile there are many advantages with this idea every idea comes with some disadvantages. But I have ways to counter them. Some people are not as fortunate as us and many sports have a fee to sign up as a result to that some families might not be able to afford that fee. So the school fills that gap from the cliff stopping that student from participating offering many activities that do not require a fee or any sort of paying. And if they do the school can fill that gap with the extra money they have, you can even donate to the school so the school can keep providing their students with the money they need in order to sign up.\nA lot of sports have practices almost every nightÂ and it might last until 9:00. So when you get home your exhausted and you don't feel like doing your homework or any project thats due soon. And its hard to find the time to do it. In the result of that the school makes the study halls or resources longer so you have time to finish your homework, essay, or school project. This will take the stress off of the students and let them sleep for a healthy amount of time instead of staying up late trying to finish that project.\nthe after school activity does not have to be a sport. It could be volunteering for school council or fightingÂ for the the best design of the yearbook. This also comes with a lot of benefits. Designing the year book is not an easy task trying to make the best possible one making you use your imagination as hard as you ever had making the most unique and creative one. So the judges would select yours as the winner. And volunteering for student council is just as hard to trying to satisfy all of the students needs and opinions making ideas that are mature but also good this makes you think out of the box and your comfort zone.\nOverall the principles Idea is a very good one that will improve the liveliness of the school. Making every student active is very important because it improves their mental health and physicall health. It will also help the students in the future providing scholarships for them to big colleges and programs. Making them feel more comfortable in front of bigger crowds. Students might not like the principles idea now but will thank him a couple years down the road.",

I agree with my principal because it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.\nThere are many students that sit inside, and dont go outside as much as the are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracirricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. there are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.\nanother good reason to have everyone do an extracirricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. .

        "There are a lot of bright sides when it comes to extracurricular activities. Some may include college, but if you make all the students in one school participate in at least one.. That's going to be hectic. It's also going to be super stressful. I disagree with this sudden change because, an abundance of kids here have personal issues, the high school doesn't have enough room, and some kids might not want to participate.\nYou never know what's happening in a person's life, unless they tell you about it. Someone might have to babysit their baby brother, until their mom comes home. Additionally, some kids that go to this school, their parents don't have a car. They probably take the bus, to and from work. So how are they going to get home after school? Exactly. So not everyone can play a sport or work on the yearbook. Some kids seriously don't have time for that. You have to be considerate of other people's problems.\nThe high school does not have enough room for every kid who wants to play a sport. I personally run track, and I love it. But there's already too many people on the team. I get that the high school has absolutely nothing to do with the middle school, but they control our afternoon sports. And what's the point of spending more money to hire more sport coaches for the middle school when we have some next door. That's a waste of money. So, if you just let the kids who are in 8th grade and want to try out for a sport, do their thing. We could all totally avoid being on a team with 60 people in it. Not to be rude or anything, but let's be honest.. Who actually wants to serve in the student council or work on the yearbook.\nWhen I say, \"\"some people might not actually want to participate.\"\" I'm referring to the lazy students. You can't actually force us to do anything after school hours. I'm totally sure that is illegal. However, if it's something related to homework, that's a totally different story. Not many people want to do anything after school. You may not see it, but a lot of students here are depressed. Please don't even try to say, \"\"an extracurricular might help them.\"\" It won't. They need to see their doctor, not you. Let us do what we want in our free time, that we legally don't have to be here at school. Y'all adults can work on the yearbook. And whoever wants to be on the student council, and whoever wanna play a sport. Let them, on their own free will.\nBasically what I'm saying is, everyone has a different POV/reason on why they do or don't do a extracurricular activity. You shouldn't force it on us because you want too, without reasoning. Be understanding and respectful of other people's time, and they might just thank you for it in the future. Â Â Â Â",

        "Have you ever wondered how active you are or how active you could be? Many students have hidden skills, but do not want to use them due to their laziness or lack of interest. If many students are lazy, it could heavily impact their future in a negative way or make them miss out on something that could be extraordinary.Â If the principal were to add a mandatory extracurricular activity, it would come with a lot of pros that can help them in the future. I believe that extracurricular activities would be beneficial because of its way to build stronger relationships with your peers, train your body to be in good shape, and could increase hidden skills that can attract people who will reward you with money, prizes and a lot of opprutunites.\nStudents around the world are consumed by loneliness or boredom, but that could change with extracurricular activities. If students were to take extracurricular activities, they could be making amazing relationships that could change their lives. For example, a student could be playing basketball and make strategies with his/her peers to win the game. This could help with your listening skills, as well as athletic abilities which are key components to build good bonds with the people around you. But while your playing with your friends, you are also exercising your body to participate in these activities.\nHealth is a key part to your life and you would be damaging your health if you just sit around, eating junk food, and watching TV. If you decide to take an activity where movement is involved, you will be able to incorporate a lot of exercise in your day. While you move, you are also exercising and losing calories. This could help you lose body fat, encourage you to do more activities to stay fit, or help you focus in school or your activity. Staying in good shape will open so many opprutunites for you to improve or succeed. If you get skilled enough with extracurricular activities, people could reward you with items or opportunities that could change your life for the better.\nSkills are a key component to become successful at school, your home or an extracurricular activity that you are taking. If you get skilled enough, people who notice you will be able to help you or reward you for the skill that you are good at. People like coaches, famous artists or singers could recruit you to an activity that could change your life. A student could be making a painting that is as good as the Mona Lisa, or a student could be so skilled that he could compete with famous basketball players like Lebron James or Kyrie Irving. This could all happen if a student were to take a extracurricular activity and put time into their activity.\nIn conclusion, mandatory extracurricular activities would be beneficial due to all of its opprutunites that it can offer. You could be the popular kid at school with all your new friends, be in good shape so that you can limit your chances of any health problems, or get recruited by people with amazing skills so that they can change your life for the better. Some students are not as motivated as they use to be. All they want to do is stare at their phones for excess hours or look for the best way to cause drama. Unless these students do extracurricular activities, they wont be a significant change and that is why it should be mandatory. They could miss out on something special, or never find their hidden talent. Extracurricular activities could change your life in many ways that you thought were impossible. If you put time into your activity, you never know what could happen, maybe you could be the next legend of your decade, or even century.",

        "Should students really be forced to commit to an extracurricular activity for school? Many children are already committed to activities outside of school. School is very important, but students have lives outside of the school environment. When you commit to something you should put your best effort in to it, but if you are occupied with other things it is very hard to give it your all. The principal should not implement this rule because kids are given homework, they are committed to other activities outside of school, and spending time with your family is essential.\nMost children receive homework from teachers, and there is no doubt about that. Homework is important to better an understanding of a topic that is taught at school, but it can get very stressful at times. Most children spend sleepless nights trying to complete homework for the amount of classes they have. Children usually have an activity outside of school so adding that to the mix with all the homework can be hectic. It is way to much pressure to try to get good grades when there is so much to handle and you also have to remember the fact that we are kids that are still growing up.\nStudents are committed to other activities, teams, and programs outside of school. Would they have to quit doing that activity because they are just to stressed to handle it all? Schedules would not only shift for students but for the parents of those students. Aren't we supposed to get eight hours of sleep every night, but then how do us students do that when there is to much pressure placed on us? Teachers expect us to focus on the material they teach us at school, but that is going to be very difficult and I don't think teachers want to teach kids who don't want to be taught.\nSpending time with family is so important. We spend most of our days at school and doing other activities that it's nice to take a break. I mean if we have so many activities then that's taking away family time. I love my family and I know most kids do too, so I would like to spend as much time as I can with them. This is just one of the negative effects of having to do an extracurricular activity.\nAlthough, doing an activity is good I don't think that students should be forced to do one. It should ultimately be their choice because it can come with some negative effects. Homework, other activities, and spending time with your loved ones can be effected. The principal's rule is something I would not be here for, or would not think is the best call to make.

        "Imagine having to take off work because the club you're in has to get together. You have to tell your mom you needed to sacrifice your work hours and won't make enough money to buy this week's groceries. By requiring kids to be apart of an extracurricular activity, difficluties similar to this start to emerge in their home life. I don't think schools should require kids to be apart of an extracurricular activity because not all kids can afford to be in one, parents are working and can't provide 2 transportation, and some kids are needed at their homes and can't leave to go to the activity.\nOne problem that shows requiring kids to be apart of an afterschool activity is not a smart choice is the fact that not everyone can afford to get the equipment needed for the activites. For example, if someone chooses to join the softball team, they would have to invest in softball cleats, a helment, shin guards, and much more supplies that were required to play. Sports equipment is not the cheapest, and not everyone has the means to pay for everything all at once. Also, a lot of clubs have a joining fee on top of all the equipment that's needed to be purchased, which doesn't make choosing an extracurricular any easier. Kids should be given the choice to join a club and if they choose to not join anything, that's their personal decision which deserves to be respected.\nAnother reason why joining an extracurricular activitiy should be optional is because a lot of parents are working and can't take the time off to drive their kid to club meetings or practices. There are other ways you could get to practice, like carpool or walking, but you can't put that type of pressure on somebody else's parent all the time and some people don't feel comfortable walking places. On top of that, parents don't always have extra money for gas and having to drive their kid to and from school more often than they normally would need to wastes a large amount of it. This is showing that it's hard for parents to have to drive their kid everywhere and it would be best to let kids decide if they can be apart of an extracurricular activty or not.\nLastly, every family has problems of some sort, some of which might require kids to be at their house as much as possible. For example, some kids have really young siblings that they have to watch as soon as they get back from school, which would take up all the time that they would spend at an afterschool activity. It's also possible that some families might be planning on moving houses soon and would need their kids to help them pack whenever they were avaliable. This would cause kids to have to be at home as much as they could and wouldn't leave any extra time to be in an afterschool activity. Being apart of an extracurricular activity is a decision made by kids and their parents and shouldn't be forced by anybody.\nIn conclusion, kids shouldn't be required to be apart of an extracurricular activity because it's very costly, it's hard for parents to provide transportation all of the time, and some kids are needed at their homes more often than not which gives them little or no free time. It wouldn't be fair for kids to be forced into doing something that would make their life harder, therefore schools should keep on giving them a choice.",

These activities will just make it harder for us to wake up stable and functional for a new day at school especially sports. No one wants to stay three hours after school for a meeting with some other kids then have our parents pick us up. Those teachers/coaches also need to go home on time to get home to spend time with their families so keeping them here for extra hours is not the best idea.\nThese activities wont be cheap, the equipment for football, soccarball,baseball,basketball wont be cheap they will cost a lot of money. Football equipment will at leastÂ coat 10,000$ because of the gear that is bought every season and the 100 yard field that needs to be cleaned every month. Basketball equipment will probably cost the same because of the jerseys bought every season and the basketball court that is polished every week. Soccarball will not cost as much as football, because the only thing the school is buying is the jerseys and gear, they already have the football field to play on.\nBy the time we get home from these extracurricular activities we will be completely sore or completely tired and we need a good nights sleep to function, so why make us lose our good nights sleep just for an activity, We need to be able to wake up in the morning and say ""ahhhh another day"" and smile instead of "" dang it man school sucks"" and get mad. These activities will completely blow us out, make us not want to come to school, and deplete the energy right out of us.

Giving them the ability to play sports in school is an amazing decision beacuse it could have a lot more benifts then people excpect, some students are naturally born with a talent for basketball or football, or even drawing so making them choose an extracurricular activity, could have them discover something they never knew they could do.\nMany students do not have anything to do once they finish there school work, they may not have the money to buy a computer to play on or an xbox. By having them do an extracurricular activity like chess or something you are giving them the abilty to see other things they can do when they are bored. If a student took chess club as an extracurricular activity it could make them see how fun the game really is and have them convince there parents to buy them the chess game as a cheeper expense to keep them busy when they have nothing to do. I realize that some students may have disablititys that stop them from doing certain extracurricular activitys and thats why there are mulitiple activitys that you can do instead of doing just sports. Such as chess club, you can work on the yearbook, or you can serve as a student council.\nThat is why having every student take an extracurricular activty is benifical to the student. It can really help them learn to be more responsible, and open there train of thought which is always good for a student, or even just give them something to do when they are bored.",

        "Sports and extracurricular activities are very common in today's schools, yet in recent years the number of students who participate in these has diminished.Â One of the few top causes are, technology, lack of drive, and higher levels of stress.Â Therefore I feel, that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity to, aid in finding peers with similar interest, be stress beneficial, and drive students with the enticement of competition.\nFirst and foremost, this will aid in finding peers with similar interest because, we are more often than not, on social media or are on our phones more intrigued in what somebody else is doing, or where they are going than what we are doing with their own lives.Â A prime example of this, is that people won't sign up for something they don't like.Â So people in chess club most likely want to be there, that is something everyone there has in common.Â Plus if we participate in multiple clubs or activities and the same people are in them to, they probably have similar interest that could lead to companionship.Â With this added benefit of friendship it opens a whole new door of opportunities for us.Â It means that we can have someone there for support or someone to go hangout with in the future.Â It can also drive us to take more risk in our life and open us to new opportunities like a new food or activity that we may enjoy.\nSecondly, a lot of students, especially in late middle to high school, are under a exponential amount of stress.Â This can cause them to do are think about harmful or life threatening activities to them or others.Â To prevent this, it would be wise for us to be in a place where we can express ourselves and let off some steam. Extracurricular activities fulfill this need for relief in our lives, and A few of the ways it does this is exposure to the community by, travel, community service, or self influence in the community.Â Another benefit is time management, many students, my self included, struggle with time management because we are constantly over run by massive a amount of knowledge from the day or week, so that leads us to give to much or little time to self benefit.Â This leads to higher levels of stress when we don't have time to do anything on the spot.Â I have first hand experience with this where just the other day I came home after a long and dreadful day where I was to tired to do anything so I simply fell asleep even though I had plans to go with my friends that evening, but was famished of energy from school.\nLastly, it opens up a window of opportunity when it comes to competition.Â As human beings we strive to be the best in life. We want to have, the style, the smarts, and the popularity in life.Â With that said, clubs and sports allow for that through competition.Â For some they get to express their leadership skills, for others they get to home in on their teamwork skills and on the very rare occasion it teaches some to be humble with loss.Â Competition gives a sense of unity with each other because everyone is working toward the same goal, winning, and it can also build confidence though leadership.Â A good example is a sport coach, in some sports one of the players is actually the coach, and having that job is often a way to build confidence because it gives a sense of power to them.Â Even losing can help them, for some they feel that winning is the only thing in life so they get all worked up about it. So when they lose and understand that its not a bad thing. It helps them learn not to be so stressed about winning, and I used to be that way, but because I learned that I can lose and it won't kill me, I have enjoyed life more.\nIn conclusion, I feel that having us participate in a extracurricular activity is a highly beneficial idea that will allow for us to enjoy life with a higher acceptance. It will let us make more friends with similar interest, allow for us to be less stressed in life, and give us a higher sense of confidence in life. All of this leads to the fact of enjoying life to the fullest and sharing that with others instead of being secluded and stressed in life which is where a lot of the student population is right now in comparison to a couple of decades ago.",

        "A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricularÂ have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.\nOne reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my gradeÂ that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.\nFurthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after schoolÂ club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.\nTherefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after schoolÂ to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high schoolÂ early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.\nStudents making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new.Â Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life. Â Â Â Â",

        "Your principle states that you are required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you think this is a good idea? would this effect you on a daily basis or in real world situations? Participating in extracurricular activities has many factors and I agree with the decision of having all students participate in an activity. There are many pros to having everyone participate because there are many different activities you can participate in also you can learn important lessons and skills also participating in an activity keeps you occupied.\nOne of the reasons i agree is because there are many different activities to choose from so everyone can find something they enjoy doing. If you enjoy playing sports joining a sports team at your school would be a good a way for you to stay active and create great friendships and bonds with people you play with. There are many different clubs you could join too, If you like taking pictures and being involved around the school working on the yearbook would be a good extracurricular choice for you. If you like making a change or you see a problem at your school joining the school council would be a good way to help your school out and make a change. As I have stated there are many different activities you could participate in so you could always find something you enjoy.\nHaving kids participate in extracurricular activities can also help you learn many important lessons and skills. Joining an activity can help you become more responsible because when your participating in an activity you have to make sure you stay on task also you have to make sure you are on time and do what your supposed to do. If you follow the rules and tasks you are given, this can help you become more responsible as you get older. You also learn how to make friendships. Having every kid participate in an activity helps people make friendships and talk to other people. This is a good way to interact with others and you can use this skill as you get older. Another important skill you learn is communication. In everyÂ activity communication is a big key to being successful in what you do because if your working with other people you need to make sure you understand whats happening and what you need to do so you need communication. As I have stated these are some important lessons and skills you can learn while joining a extracurricular activity.\nParticipating in an activity also helps you stay occupied and busy. Some activities take place after school so instead of staying home and sitting on your phone or watching TV you get to participate in an activity which gets you up and moving. Also being in an activity keeps you active because if your playing a sport or in a club where exerciseÂ is involved that keeps you moving and healthy. Another pro is that sometimes being in activities can be a distraction for you and help you get out of trouble because instead of going somewhere with your friends that can possibly get you in trouble you are doing something productive and good. As I have listed being in an extracurricular activityÂ is a good way to stay occupied and get good things done.\nAs I have stated these are some of the reasons I think its a good idea for everyone to participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many different activities for people to participate in also you can learn important skills and lessons also participating keeps you occupied. I hope my reasons convinced you that everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea and many good things come out of joining one. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "If a principle were to make all kids participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, what would kids and parents think? It could quite possibly go either way, a hit or a miss.\nMost of the kids that go to school are antisocial, and what most extracurricular activities are about is communicating, for example, running a play in football, calling for the ball in basketball, talking to other kids in the student council. And that's most definitely not fair to the kids who are not very sociable. Besides, you also have to try out for sports, so if you happened to not make the team, your stuck with something you don't like.\nAlthough some students may not be sociable, this rule could open some new doors for them, finding a new passion, or something they do in a extracurricular activities might just be their job when they get older.\nParents may also get very involved as well, everybody knows that if a parent sees their child unhappy, they'll do everything in there power to stop or put and end to it.

The point I'm getting at is there are a lotÂ of opportunities you can have with extracurricular activities.

Band is a purely instrumental group composed of Brass, Percussion, Woodwind, and even Strings. If you like to make music, those are your best choices.\nDon't like music and instead like to read.

        "Say your principle has made a new rule this year that you must participate in a minimum of one after school activity. This means it will force kids to take action and try something new with a extracurricular activity. I hope my school does this because it will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.\nMy first reason why this would be a good idea is because students will make new friends. We all know there are some of those kids that are anti social and do not like to talk to that many people. But if you force them to do an after school activity, they will make new friends in that program. This can make their self esteem rise as their circle of friends grows. Even if you are not one of those anti social people, you can still meet many different types of people annd make cool friends. If you are taking the same after school activity, that mean you guys both like that same thing. This will make it even easier to meet new people that share your interests.\nMy second reason why this would be a good decision by your principle is because it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer. By some peoples senior year, there may be some seniors that took so many after school activities, that the school loves them because it shows how much they want to learn and get involved. You may get an award at graduation or some recongnition for participating in so many extracurricular activities. I know someone who does a sport, works on the yearbook, and is on the debate team. This shows they want to learn and is a good sign for the teachers at the school. This represents to teachers that he is a well rounded student. Most extracurricular activites also go on your high school trans script. This means colleges will see you were involved with many programs at your high school and it will strengthen your chance to get into better colleges.\nMy third and final reason why this rule should be added by your principal is because it is something new to try. Maybe you have never even thought about going on the debate team because you thought you would never like that. You try it anyways because of this new rule and you turn out to be really good at it and now you have a new hobby. With this new rule forcing students to take part in extracurricular activities, it can expand someones personality by trying things they would never have tried before. It is always good to try new things because it can give you an idea of things that you like and do not like. By trying new things out in after school activities, it will help shape what you want to do with your life as you go through high school.\nThere are really no bad things that can happen with after school activities. You may get stuck in something that you do not like that much, but that is just practicing perserverance and determination. hope my principle will add this new rule forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.",

When you get use to being a lazy childÂ it goes into you adult hood and you become more and more lazier and don't want to go and get a job to be able to feed yourself. You might have a familyÂ thats hungryÂ and you might need to go out and do a extra thing to get food. The person will remember,when you was in school and didn't want to do the extra activity and it will mass with your mind.\nA child would probably thinkÂ the same way, but sometimes you might need to handle yo business even if you dont want to do it. extracurricular activity doesnt have to be work it could be anything like,camps,helping the homeless,donating money. Some people might need to get use to extra stuff cause when the kids get older they are going to want to be able to be smart and be able to read. sometimes you never know what can help with your life so gotta make it count. Some kids might think it's dumb but i think its good to be on a higher level you could even get a good grade for it.\nTo be a kid at this school its a good school,Im pretty sure that the principal wants the kids to be great coming into a huge world, so to be able to do that we will have to take reasobilty. I want extracurricular activity because you can learn a lot of stuff in a little period of time. When its extra work or an activity take it cause in the long run you wont regret it. Its the first time the principal has wanted this for the school and its property for a reason,If you not good with decisions thisÂ should be a good one. Sometimes you can tell your best friendÂ to make u want to do it so they can with you. a lotÂ of people went on their own like me i decidedÂ to go and i was not even bad.\nA lotÂ of kids enjoy extracurricular activity,I argree with the decision because some kids might like to be in extra stuff to become a better studentÂ and for themselves. Kids need extracurricular activity, A lotÂ of kids brains are not all the way devolvedÂ yet so there for they can't think like an adult. Most kids play sports and things and some kids just sit and play games and watch TV all day long. ThinkÂ about if they see what the good kids are doing and see them doing extra work they might follow behind the bigger person and get their work done. The principal is right for extracurricular activity so we can become better and would get out and do a lot of stuff.Â Â",

        "Have you ever come home from school and been bored, because you have nothing to do? Fortunately enough for you, there are tons of extracurricular activities available. I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first reason I believe this, is that students are able to try a new activity and meet new people. In addition to that, students can learn teamwork and make friends from an extracurricular. Finally, students participating in an extracurricular learn how to balance school work on on top of their activity.\nWhen students try new activities, they can discover things about themselves and new people with common interests. Students may discover a talent or interest in something that they never knew they had. For example, if a person has never kicked a soccer ball, then they will not know whether they're good at it or they like it. Furthermore, even if students come to find that they don't like their extracurricular, they can still use this experience in the future. Just like when a person tries a new food, if that individual doesn't like it, then they will remember. The students can then use their knowledge to avoid what they don't like in the future. Last, it is beneficial to try a new activity, because you may meet someone you don't know who has similar interests to yours. Meeting these new people with common interests can lead to new friendships, that never would have happened. Trying a new extracurricular allows students to learn more about themselves and meet new people.\nParticipating in group activities is very important to students. For example, teamwork can be learned by practicing and working with a team in an extracurricular. In an extracurricular it is crucial that team members trust, rely, and work with each other to achieve the common goal. Secondly, using this teamwork to collaborate and accomplish goals, can lead to new friendships. When a student learns to trust and work with a team member within a extracurricular, they can also trust and collaborate with that person outside of the extracurricular. Last but not least, being able to work in a group is a very important skill that people look for when they are hiring for jobs. Companies look for teamwork in their employees, because co-workers need to be able to collaborate and respect each other to do their jobs efficiently. Activities that schools offer teach an important lesson about teamwork, that can create new friendships and be used outside of school.\nPartaking in an extracurricular and school at the same time has many benefits. The first of those being, that participating in an activity and school at the same time teaches students the manage their time. Adding an extracurricular on top of schoolwork can only be done if the student learns to use all of their time wisely. This time management allows a person to do more things they love to do. If a person can be efficient and not procrastinate on things they have to do, they will have leftover time to do whatever they want. The final reason a student should attend school and do an extracurricular, is that time managementÂ is a necessary life skill that students must learn. In the future students may need to balance a family, work, and make time for themselves all at the same time. Participating in school and an extracurricular teaches students a valuable life lesson about time management, that can allow these students to do what they love.\nI think that all students in school must partake in at least one extracurricular. I think this, because students can get new experiences and meet new people, while trying a new activity. Not only that, activities students participate in can teach teamwork that can lead to new friendships. My last reason for believing this is that, taking part in school and extracurricular activities gives students a lesson about how to manage time wisely. I believe that all schools should require students to partake in an extracurricular.",

        "Do you wanna be successful in every aspect of your life? Well I believe that it would be a great idea to have every students participate in a extracurricular activity. Because one it would keep every student focused on something positive. Second it could help them get into college or get a good job. Not to mention it could give them learning experiences and keep them out of trouble.\nOne reason I believe that it would be a good idea is because it would keep students focused on something. For example if a kid decides to try out a sport they could fall in love with it so they work hard at it. So not only could they put that work ethic in the sport they could also put it in the classroom. This can also ready students for the work world when you have to be motivated to do stuff.\nAnother benefit of every kid doing a extra activity is that it could help get them into a college. Like if you do volunteering at an old folks home that could help out a lot. Or if you did something like charity work. playing sports can also help you get into a good college. Not only could that help with getting in college but also help you get a job, etc.\nAlso if you do activities it can help you stay out of trouble. EspeciallyÂ if your a kid that does get in trouble a lot this can help you eliminate bad influences , distractions, etc. it can also give you good learning experiences. So if you have an activity going on it will help you greatly with staying out of trouble.\nTo conclude I think extra curricular activities would be very positive for students. It could help your work ethic. It can help you focus your time and every in to something positive. Help you with getting into college or a job. It can also help you stay out of trouble.",

        "What do you like to do after school? The answer is probably go home and relax. But wouldn't it be great if everyone did an extracurricular activity. Their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day. I think kids should have to do extracurricular activities because you make new friends, you help out your school, and it creates other opportunities.\nWhile doing extracurricular activities you can make new friends. Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.\nSome extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot. It may be in a small way but it still helps. Groups that make the yearbook or students that serve on the student council are helping the school out. They are helping to keep the school in order and to keep students happy. Other extracurricular activitiesÂ like football and basketball help their school and community by winning games this helps the school make money, it helps the community by providing entertainment. Some schools even have environmental clubs that help the school, the community, and even the world. All in all, extracurricular activities help the school and community.\nMost importantly extra curricular activities create more opportunities. When doing extracurricular activitiesÂ you might find out that you are really good at something. People that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college. You might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing. Also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college. ExtracurricularÂ activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding.\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities have a lot of benefits. They can help you make friends, help your school and community, and create new opportunities. People may not want to do extracurricular activities but it will help you out later on in life and you will have plenty of fun.Â",

        "I joined a extracurricular activity and made a lot of friends in the process, 1 of myÂ best friends is actually someone i met during a extracurricular activity, his name is Generic_Name and we met through football. I agree with having students being in a extracurricular activity because you make more friends, become more social with better communication skills, and you might find a activity that you like to do.\nOne of the reasons why I think it's good for people to have more friends is so you dont have to deal with loneliness. Being lonely is something that no one wants to go through. You might have a great personality or a really cool talent, but no one is willing try and get to know you. Nobody wants to sit at the lunch table by themselves, or have a class with no friends in it either. And also people want to be known as the \"\"cool kid\"\" or something of that nature, which isn't a bad idea. But if you make friends with people who act just like you then that'llÂ be a lot better than hanging out with the cool kids.\nAnother reason on why its good to have friends is so school isn't as boring. Walking around in the halls by yourself, sitting in a class with no friends, or jogging in P.E. by yourself is boring. If you have friends then he or she will invite you out to do stuff, so it also makes life at home more fun.\nmy last reason on why it is good to have friends is because a good friend can make your day a lotÂ better. If your team just lost the championship and your sad then hanging out with your best friend might not be a bad idea. Or if something is bothering you then a friend can tell when something is wrong with you,and he or she will try to make you feel better or if they have to leave you alone then they will. A good friend should want the best for you,they should make you feel happy. However, if a friend is always putting you down, making you sad, or can't make you feel good about yourself, then that person isn't a good friend.\nSome of the reasons why i think having good communication skills and being more social is good is so making newÂ friends isn't hard for you. If you have bad communication skills then making new friends might not be easy for you. And since your not that good you might not even try to make new friends because you might not even try to make new friends because you probably think that you might come off as weird, and you wont get that personÂ to be your friend. But if you participate in a after school activity then your social skills will grow, and you will also know how to talk to different kinds of people.\nLastly, i think its good to be social and good at communicating in the real world. In the real world you will most likely be working with someone else. If your a doctor, do sports, or something along the lines of working with other people, then having good communication skills would make your job easier. If you have bad communication then your job will beÂ harder and you might not like it as much because of the people you work with.\nMy final reason on why iÂ think students should participate in a after school activity is because if they find something they like to do. If a student is doesÂ a sport like basketball and he or she likes it, then that person might want to play basketball something around that topic. Maybe they dont want to be a basketball player but instead a coach or a physical trainer. Or maybe they just want to be in shape so that their body can do a physical activityÂ at its full potential.\nJoining a after school activity doesnt seem so bad, i think theirs a lot more benefits if you do it than if you dont. Meeting new people,making new friends, being more social, and communicating better with others seems like you have a lot to gain.\nMy reasons for why the school should put kids in a extracurricularÂ activity are making new friends,have better social and communication skills, and they might find a activity that they like, i agree that the principal should enforce this rule and i hope i could convince other people to support my opinion.",

        "I disagree with this because the principal shouldnt have to make everyone do at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons on students dont have to do a activity because some students might have anxiety, work around the house, or homework. Some students might have anxiety because they probably been bullied by classmates and other times they probably grew up in a rough life. Some students do work around the house like some kids live in a farm and they have to take care of animals, and some kids might babysit their siblings. The principal dont know some of the kids went through in their life. For instance, some kids probably got abused, homeless, and foster care. So the principal should ask about how they feel about they feel about the changes of the school activities. Most students dont like sports because coaches push them a lotÂ or there not interested. When a student is behind in school and they have to make up work it takes them time. Some kids dont have time for yearbook or student council. People dont like yearbook clubs because they have to work on a page and it takes days to finish. Some students cant do student council because they cant behave, focus, and be responsible. I have few more thoughts. When it comes to sports parents dont allow there child to eligible to play any sports like football because the injuries, concussions, and even deaths. Students might have body issues for sports like leukemia, and schlolisosis. So I think students doesnt have to do at least one after school activity. Some students dont have the grades to be eligible for a sport like they have 3 F's. Finally some students have to do other sports out of school like wrestling and the gym. So I think students shouldnt have to do at least one activity.",

        "Your principal has decided that all student must participate in or at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree with this? I agree with the principal because kids need to get out and make new friends, learn how to work with others and do better in school.\nOne reason, to make friends can help you because you will see life in there or a different way. You can learn new things about them. Let's say you guys are playing basketball an one of the boys did a lay up, you can teach or show them a different type of move they can do in basketball like how to shoot when you are 6ft away from the net and not miss. It can help prove your low self stream and help you become brave or bold because you know that your friends will have your back.Â There was this one thing when my school sister(friend) cyan had my back when there was people picking on me about my shoes in 7th grade she told them to leave me alone and you are so mean and rude. From that day on we are still the best of friends/ school sister.\nFor an example, you can learn how to work with others. Learn from other people can teach you new things.\nLike cooking someone can show you or teach you they recipes and you can do the same. A lotÂ of people have a different ways of see things like in photographer you have one way ofÂ seem one thing and someone else can see a another way, but if you can put or come together with both ideas you guys can both make a amazing picture. Work together mean there will have to be teamwork like everyone has a job to do to get the work done and they can feel like the are part of this team.\nFinally, do better in school. Extracurricular activity can help you in school because some of this activity you will need to have good grades in your classes in order to be there. I know in basketball and cheer you can't get in trouble like get in fight, suspicion and get bad grades. Yes it must seem a lot of work but it not, but real it's a lot of fun. Your attitude will be much better and so will your attendance.\nAt lastly, make new friends, learn how to work with others, and do better in school.

        "I believe after-school activities should be a requirement made by every school across America. After-school activities have proven to help students with a variety of things in their school years. For example, students get easily recognized by various amounts of colleges for the activity they are doing. Another reason is it helps students make friends with people who enjoy the same things as them. Last but not least, it also allows students to experience something new and prepare them for the future. If my principal were to make my friends and I to do an extracurricular activity, I would agree to it. It is something to do and it is enjoyable. I think students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it helps students get noticed by colleges, it gives them a chance to make friends, and it gives them preparation for the future.\nFirstly, after-school activities give students a chance to get watched by colleges. Extracurricular activities are one of the main things colleges look for. For example, my brother signed up for\nB-Tech to do engineering. After hearing about it,\nVirginia Tech started watching him and has invited him to their campus plenty of times. Along with getting noticed, students also have a chance of getting scholarships. Scholarships are a huge deal to many kids and teens who want to go to college. Although earning a scholarship is like getting into\nThe Olympics , it is still possible and it doesn't hurt to try. Scholaships have been helpful to many athletes and doctors throughout the years, so why wouldn't they be helpful to the kids who want to succeed as well? After all, it can be helpful to anyone, and perhaps a student is striving to earn one right now.\nAnother reason students should join an activity is it helps them make friends. Making friends in an environment students enjoy is the easiest way to make friends. The students who are in the same activity probably enjoy some of the same things as the other kids around them, making it easier to converse with them. It also teaches students to be more outgoing, which can help them with future problems, like speaking up. Students can be more comfortable and confident around kids just like them. Even if kids don't want to make new friends, they can join a club with their current friends and spend more time with them. Having friends within the activity can prevent the activity from being boring. Lastly, not only can it help students make friends in the activity, but it shows that the students involved might be interested in something other kids might have notÂ expected from them. This makes them more attractive, enjoyable, and unpredictable, which are characteristics that help attract friends.\nAlong with the other reasons, activities can help prepare students for the future. These activities require time management, which is something many kids don't understand or haven't learned. Time management is helpful for the future when students get jobs and need to work out hours with their boss. It not only helps with time management, but what students want to do in the future as well. Students aren't prone to enjoy the first club they try or even the fifth, but it can help them find a new hobby. A new hobby may not seem like a big deal, but it can end up being what the student wants to do in the future and go to college for. It also trains them for that profession they want to succeed in. High schools have the availability of many different clubs and activities, so why not try them? Students have the capability of joining something, and if they don't like it, at least they tried it and now they know not to do it later in life.\nIn conclusion, I believe students should join a club or an after school activity. It helps with many things the students may need in the future or strive for later in life. Kids who have the ability to join something that may change their life should join whatever might impact them and their future. Even if they might not see it, it helps them a long way into the future and opens up opportunities that might not be available to every child. Students should join activities and clubs whether they are required or not. It has so many benefits, I don't see why students shouldn't join. They can make friends, get noticed by colleges, find new hobbies, prepare for the future, and so much more. Overall, students can find success by just trying something they may have never before. Something that may seem like a simple activity or a \"\"hang-out\"\" can turn into something so much more.Â",

        "Have you ever been forced to do something that you did not want to do? Like a sport or some type of activity? Well the principal has decided that now on you have to be taking an extracurricular activity and I think that idea is terrible and disagree with his decision and here are my three main reasons. First what if the students parents can not help there kid with anything involving the activity. Secondly, the students may not have enough time for the activity. Thirdly, students may not like any of the activities.\nFirst lets talk about how parents can't get involved/or help with the activity at all. Like what if the activity fee is to much and the students parents can not afford it. Or there parents could be working later than usual and there not able to pick you up from the activity because there to busy with work. Also what if your parents are at home watching other siblings how are they gonna drop/pick you up. Or even what if they stayed home sick and there not feeling good who's going to pick them up or drop them off. And what if there exhausted from a big day of work and don't feel likeÂ getting up or moving because there to tired. Finally what if there injured and can't get out of bed then who's gonna pick or drop of the kids because they obviously can't.\nNext lets talk about students not having enough time for the activity because they have stuff to do. Like they have a lot of HW they have to do or catch up on. Or there going to another siblings activity because they can't stay home alone. Also they may have to stay home and watch younger siblings because they can't be left home alone without someone. Or even what if they planned with a couple of friends to hangout that day and go do something fun. And what if there parents have a lot of chores planned for them and there not able to finish because they have to go to the activity. Finally what if they do other activities outside of school like a sport or a club.\nFinally lets talk about how the students may not like any of the activities the school has and what it could cause. Like the students could get mad that there being forced to do something they do not wanna do. Or they could develop a bad relationship with there parents because they feel like there parents are forcing them to do it. Also they might get so bored they will just end up skipping the activity instead of going to it. Or even there behavior could change in a bad way making them mean, naughty, and disrespectful. And they could start developing depression because there being forced to do something they do not want to do which can build up depression/anger/sadness. Finally they could get really bored of the activity and keep misbehaving.\nThis is why forcing kids to do something they don't want to do/or can't do is bad. Because it can lead up to a lot of bad things in a students life and a very few good things. So I think these activities should be optional so you do not have to deal with your parents not being able to help you with anything involving the activity, or not having enough time to do the activity, and not having any activities you like. So if they were optional it would create not as much stress on the students and parents so not everyone is freaking out.",

        "Imagine having to stay after school for an activity you don't enjoy. Students spend seven long hours learning each day and the last thing they want to do is stay at school longer. Most students want to relax after a tiring day of learning. I don't think students should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity.\nStaying after school for a sport, club, or even student council will take away time with family, make expenses to maintain the school after hours rise, and give students less time to complete homework or attend other commitments.\nSpending time with family is important and much needed. If students are forced to stay after school then they're taking away valuable time to be with family. When students are done learning everyone should be able to go home to see their family. A lotÂ of people like to eat dinner together and it would be hard if your kid is having to stay after school for an activity. Adding extra time spent after school can mess up a families plans for the night which isn't fair.\nMaintaining the school for seven hours a day is hard enough. Adding at leastÂ an hour of the school operating each day increases the money spent onÂ heat, air conditioning, and electricity. Each day one hundred dollars is spent on just electricity for the building. Adding fifteen dollars to each day for electricity will add up. Heat and air conditioning is way more expensive than you think. The school spends around five hundred dollars each week towards keeping the school comfortable. Having extracurricular activities will require that amount to rise.\nMajority of students have something to do after school whether it's homework or other commitments. Teachers normally require homework to practice the skills students learn in class. If after school activities are required then homework will have less time to be completed. When there is a small time frame for assignments, students will get stressed and not do their best work. Most kids have a sport or music lesson they attend after school although, the after school activity may get in the way by making the kid late or tired.\nAlthough extracurricular activities may help students get involved with the school, there are many reasons why this is not a good idea. I think the principal should not follow through with this proposal because there could be a lotÂ of negative effects. Taking away time to be with family, more expenses for maintaining the school, and giving less time for homework and other commitments are just three of the many negatives. Forcing students to do something they don't want to after learning hours is not fair. Students and teachers need to spend the afternoon hours at home relaxing not at school.Â",

        "I believe that all students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they dont want to. They should be able to do what they want and not forced to do extra things, now if some students want to participate in some of the activities they can but others should not be forced to. Most students like there free time in school and not forced to do something to make them give up that free time, others may want to do the activities which is fine but others shouldÂ not be forced to do the activities, and students may not find any of the extracurricular activities fun or interesting so which they may not find fun in doing.\nFirst of all, students like there free time. Should they really give that up for something they dont want to do? If a student has free time in school they would like to enjoy it, not have to spend time doing something they did not want to do most all forced to do. Free time in school for students is like having a day off, they have time to chill and take a breather from work and many other things. If the students free time was taken away do to a extracurricular activate they would be really mad and frustrated students. Why would you want to take that away from the students, it is one of the only things enjoyable for them.\nSecond of all, some students may want to do that activate but others just dont want to. Now if some students would want to participate in the activities they may but forcing another to do it is not right. the students should have a choice if they want to or if they dont, if they want to they can if not its OK and they cant or should not be forced to. People dont like to be forced to do an extracurricular activities if they are doing just fine.\nFinally, what if the students do not find any of the activities fun or enjoyable? Do you really want to make some body do something they dont enjoy or find fun in at all? If they dont find fun in the activity they wont do it and may end up failing the extracurricularÂ activity they were forced to do. So if they cant find fun in it why should they have to do it. Many others may want to do something else that is fun and enjoyable and not forced.\nNow if that is not enough to change your mind on having to make them do an activity that they loose free time, that some may want to do but others dont, and finally may not find any fun or interest in, then i dont have any thing else for you then. You should not have to make anyone do anything if they dont want to. after all they are human beings they should be able to do what they want.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "I live in the middle of nowhere. Deep in the woods on a small gravel road in a town most people have never heard of. In fact I dont live in the same town as my school. A little bus picks me up at exactly 8:20 am and hustles down my pothole-filled road into the next town over, just in time for the bell. But not all kids live like I do. Many can walk to their school in 2 minuets tops. We both come to school for the same amount of time, and then go back to our homes. Now, who's to say that we both aren't busy? Homework, family, other hobbies and activities that take up the rest of daylight. Busy with something that won't always involve school. Now, the prinicple has decided that all students are required to participate in at least one extracirricular activity. Who has the time for that? Student's should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.\nOne of my favorite hobbies is singing. I take lessons every week, and I preform in little shows in the spring and fall. I have lessons on Tuesday and Thursday, from 6 to 7pm. I get home about 7:30, and then I go to sleep. I use the couple of hours before hand to finish homework and eat dinner. My day is busy from sunrise to sunset. Now, there are other kids whos days end at 10:30pm. Some play a sport, and those practices last hours . Others are in theater, and I know from experience that play practice NEVER ends. We simply have no time in the day for an extracurricular activity. But not everyone is fortunate enough to have after school hobbies and play sports.\nI live quite literally in the middle of nowhere. I can recall more times than not when my friends tell me that their parent's wont pick me up because of where I live. My mom travels a lot for her work, and my dad lives cities away. My brother's babysitter can barely get him into the car in time to drive me to singing lessons. His tantrums are a melody within itself. I am lucky that I am able to be driven to my lessons, but not everyone is given that luxury. Some teenagers are home alone until their parents get back late at night, others just aren't allowed to leave their house. One of my closest friends lives in the heart of her town, but her parents wont let her walk anywhere unless it is to or from school. Everyone's families are different. Not everyone has a stay-at-home mom to drive them places, or the gas money for it. Unless the school wants to send a bus or reimburse the families who have to pick their kids up from these required activities, we might just have to stay at home.\nSpeaking of home life, what about our families? I have two younger brothers, one with a disability. I have spent more weekends then i'd like to admit watching my brothers, and many evenings when the babysitter has to leave earlier than my mom get home. Other kids watch their siblings the minute they get home from school, becuase their parents can't afford or don't trust a babysitter. And not all of us get paid to do it. I sure don't. It's \"\"part of my responsibility as the oldest.\"\" It sucks. But I know my mom works hard, and family is more important than an after schoolÂ activity. I have friends who are the youngest, and do whatever they please. I know other people who cook dinner and clean the house for their parents and younger siblings. It's just how the cookie crumbles. Lots of kids just do not have the capabilities to participate in these extracirricular activites.\nWhat about the kids who play video games, or do nothing but sleep when they get home? Some of them walk home from school everyday, and do as they please. I can think of one person in seconds who lives a life like that. I call them up after schoolÂ and they're playing on their X box. I personally don't see the hype about video games, but then again, I prefer gardening and writing stories. Video gamesÂ and the internet in general are a topic of controversy and speculation everyday, and it plays a major role in the modern generation. But who's to say it's all bad? Besides, us kids go to school 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 180 days per school year. We need a break! Homework bleeds into home life, and many of us are quite busy in the after schoolÂ category. Kids who play video gamesÂ or simply sleep after schoolÂ need those little bursts of joy in their week. Some kids stay up late completing homework that is too overwhelming or difficult for them to finish quickly. We need more than 8 hours of sleep, and many teenagers get less than that everyday. The trend of 8 hours of sleep was actually created by a company in an advertisement, not by a study done by scientists. It was advertised to promote 9-5 jobs, and eventually became a lifestyle in the United States. We're still kids, and we still need as much sleep as infants. Our society hasn't seen the potential our generation has because we're constantly drained. Adding an extracurricular activity isn't going help.\nOverall, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. Some adults may not realize it but us teenagers have our own lives too! I like hanging out with friends and sleeping in on weekends, and that doesn't make me lazy. Us students are too busy, too tired, and too involved in our families for more activities. Some of us don't have the facilities for it either. There is simply not enough time. Which is ironic considering we live with a calendar that has 365 days.\nAt the end of the day, every kid does their best, and it puts a lot of stress on teenagers. 14, 15, and 16 year old kids are being given work most adults can't handle. We're treated like little kids, yet expected to behave and act like adults. Everyday asks a lot from us, and we try. We deserve time away from school. We deserve time for ourselves. So let us have it.",

        "Did you know that the human touch is very important to the human brain? Human touch lets the brain know that you're still alive and breathing. It will let the brain know that their body will always be okay and that they are in safe hands. Without human touch, you or anyone else, could die.

These kids will become more social with eachother and they may end up making friends. Even if this activity requires the tiniest conversation, the brain is becoming more active and is not being isolated in it's own thoughts.

It will leave a perminant smile on their face whenever they think of their school. Everyone will have fun yet different scenarios they can look back on and use for future references.\nSome kids might have a spiraling and out of control mental health situation. If that is a big problem, then they should not have to do the extracurricular activity. Anything having to do with mental to physical pain should be taken seriously at all times. The smallest thing may be able to tigger this emotion. If this student wants to do an activity, you should let them! Anyone with mental health and physical pain issues can try new things which includes after school activities, just take things a bit slow and see how it goes!\nStudents may experience mental health issues but you should at least let them try to participate because, these students will become healthier and they will have this for future references!

        "The sound of laughter fills the air as one girl talks about her experience as a midfielder. The other midfielders smile while the attack and defense laugh their hearts out. The lacrosse club is one of the many extracurricular activities at this school. Though you may be busy, extracurricular activities can help you make new friends, stay active, and makes you use your time wisely.\nEver have trouble connecting with people? When you join a after-school activity, your group all have that one thing in common, which is a great place to start. Like in the first paragraph; maybe it's lacrosse. You can connect further by joining the subgroups. In the lacrosse club, there are 3: defense, attack, and midfield. Or say you joined the book club; you could talk about books you've read. Kinda like lacrosse, book club also has subgroups: fiction and non-fiction. All in all, extracurricular activities will help you meet more people.\nStaying active physically and socially is good for your mental and physical health. When you talk to others, you improve your diplomacy skills, as well as your ability to hold a conversation. After all, who wants to be lonely for the rest of their life? Exercise, as I'm sure you know, does wonderful things to the body. Such as reducing fat, raising your cardiovascular endurance, and, in general, making you feel good. Have you ever gone for a, say, 1 or 2 mile walk and felt refreshed after? It feels nice doesn't it? So get out there and have fun!\nHowever, some people may say that they don't have enough time for extracurricular activities. They have soccer practice Monday, basketball on Wednesday, lacrosse practice on Friday, and a basketball game, as well as a lacrosse game on Saturday. While that is a busy schedule, that person is forgetting about Tuesday and Thursday. What if they wanted if off? Well, think about it. Does it seem like these after-school things take up much time? Not at all! In fact, most of them only take up an hour of your day. This will also help you manage your time so you can do as much as possible within that small period. This skill will also come in handy when you are older.\nAfter-school activities are a great way to meet new people, help you get out more, and use your time to it's fullest potential. You should take advantage of the amazing opportunity you have to be more, well, out there! So the real question is, why wouldn't you join an extracurricular activity?",

It's not always fun when you are required to participate in something you don't like.\nWell my principle thinks that all students must participate in some type of activity or sport during school. I have a few opinions on that. First of all there are different types of people. Not everyone likes to participate in sports or activities. Theres also people that aren't veryÂ social so, participating in anything might not be there thing. Then theres some that are just lazy. On the other side their are people that like to participate and be social with people. Theres actually interested in sports or school activities. But sometimes poeple just want to talk with their friends. I think it should't be required to participate in school activities. You should be able to choose what you want to do.

        "Our beloved principal has decided that students attending this excellent school must be a member of a least one extracurricular activity, and I am in complete support of this idea. The benefits of this proposal are exquisite and will not only help students, but parents as well. Some students may think staying after school would be an annoyance, but there is something for everyone after the last bell. Whether students join a football team or a math club, many children will have a bright smiles on their faces when they're participating in an activity of their choice. All students should be required to participate in a minimum of one extracurricular activity because it will enhance the minds and muscles of students, teach students to be active citizens, and assist working parents.\nTo begin with, executing this decision will strengthen the minds of many students. Fun clubs like the Drama Club and Art Club promote out of the box thinking and creativity. A vast majority of students would benefit from these teachings because they work a part of a student's brain that isn't alwaysÂ challenged throughout the school day. Also, clubs are great way to introduce new career paths to children. For example, the Robotics Team introduces students to the growing world of STEM. Practicing STEM from a young age, especially in an after school club, is a spectacular way to increase the number of future engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, which would heavily benefit our technology advancing planet.\nIn addition to clubs, students would also have more opportunity to join sports teams. Some parents cannot afford to pay for a recreational or travel sports team, so this required extracurricular activity could help a number of less fortunate students participate in a sport of their choice. This requirement couldÂ also promote health benefits for students. With an extracurricular activity as requirement, some students who usually don't exercise may join a sports team, leading to an overall healthier school. Furthermore, with more students participating in school sports, there will most likely be more supporters at games. This could result in more school spirit and in total a more enthusiastic student body.\nAlso, requiring students to participate in after school activities could teach majority of our students to become good, active citizens. Good citizens participate in local government. This new requirement teaches students to participate in extracurricular activities, consequently many of them will form a positive habit of being active in their communities. Children form habits and learn many critical skills in their grade school years, so teaching them to start participating now could greatly impact the future of community activity. To elaborate, some students may join student council. Student council is superb preparation for future government jobs students might hold. Therefore, requiring students to become members of at least one extracurricular activity could lead to a better society with more active citizens.\nLastly, this decision could assist hard working parents. Most parents work 9:00am to 5:00pm, and if their children are at school for an additional hour for an extracurricular activity, they would have the luxury of being able to get all of their work done, and pick up their children from school on time. Mothers and fathers of many students work extremely hard to provide for their families. With an extra hour to spare on a day their children stay after school, parents could potentially have a more zen car ride, free from worry of being late to the car pick up line. As a result of having additional time to get to the school building, parents may drive slower. This could lead to safer roads with fewer accidents.\nTo conclude, the principal's decision to require students to participate in one extracurricular activity is beneficial to the student body and their parents. The decision helpful because it will introduce new ways of learning to many students, promote exercise and school spirit, teach students to participate in their communities, and help working mothers and fathers. This idea could also make the roads safer. As a student, member of many clubs, and a car rider, I believe this decision will make our school better for students, and make our school unique from others. Requiring students to participate in a minimum of one after school activity was a great decision made by our principal and should be supported by all of the amazing students that make out school special.",

        "Generic_Name\nGeneric_Name\nEnglish Honors 8\nMarch 11, 2020\nSchool PrincipalsÂ Should Not Require Extracurricular Activities\nTheir are many benefits to participating in after school activities, they can improve your knowledge on a variety of topics, introduce you to new experiences, provide a chance to strengthen your social skills, and most of all they can be enjoyable! They are not usually enjoyable however, when you have been forced into taking them, and especially not when everyone in your school has been forced to also. There are many reasons why students don't want to or even can't partake in these activities some of which being that it is a financial struggle for many families, it causes a stress for time, and can lead to disappointment.\nSome parents cannot afford to pay the fees required to enroll their children in extracurricular activities. Imposing a rule that these activities are mandatory would mean that they would have to spend the money that they need for other more important things in order to satisfy the principal's instructions. This would then deprive them of a comfortable home lifeÂ since they would be unable to purchase certain needs, and even farther from receivingÂ any desired luxuries. It may even endanger them because they are in an unsafe predicament that they can't afford to get out of.\nThe children's guardians might not have a flexible schedule that will allow them to take time to transport their child to and from their activities. Making them required would result in parents having to take time off of work or enlist others to either accomplish their home responsibilities or pick up their child from the school activity. The students would suffer from time deprivation as well. Time that the students should be spending on school work or family interaction would instead be put towards their activities. They would also not have any time to develop personal hobbies since they would be participating in arranged activities.\nBecause every student would be enrolling in school clubs at once there would be high competition and a large portion of the students would end up in activities that they don't want. This would leave them disappointedÂ about their assignment and disdainful of the principal's program. There is a possibility that it would even discourage them enough not to partake in similar activities in the future. Thus this requirement has more of a possibility of restricting the students strengths and cutting their future options further in life.\nThough there are some rewards that come with participating in extracurricular activities not everyone should have to. Each person has different factors to consider when choosing whether or not to join an after school club or sport. Furthermore, it should be up to the student and their family to decide if they can participate in these groups.",

        "These days, before deeming them worthy of an acceptance letter, colleges take many aspects of a students life, into consideration. Many think colleges only look at grades and test scores, when that is not the case.\nAlthough, grades and test scores are crucial to admission, they aren't the only thing colleges look at. Extracurricular activities are a great way to stand out to colleges. Many students shy away from participating in extracurricular activities because they aren't aware of the benefits. Requiring students to participate in them would eliminate future grievances.\nLeadership skills, passion, and being well-roundedÂ are all things colleges look for in students.\nColleges absolutely love having notable alumni; which is why, they look for pupils with many examples of leadership.\nSchools offer various opportunities to show off those skills.\nOne popular example is sports.\nWhat says leadership better than being team captain?\nSports are also a common way to receive scholarships.\nLast year, someone on the Riverside Baseball Team got into Princeton. It is very likely they got in because of their performance on the baseball team. He probably wouldn't have gotten into Princeton if he hadn't played baseball. The Riverside Baseball player is a key example of how extracurricular activitiesÂ are beneficial to students. If one isn't athletic, sports are not the only option.\nBeing the president, treasurer, or even secretary, of a club are wonderful positions to show leadership.\nMy older sister was the treasurer of Humanity First in her junior year and the president in her senior year; she was accepted into Duke.\nIt is highly likely that if she wasn't president, or treasurer, she wouldn't have been admitted. Leadership skills are vital for college acceptance, and requiring extracurricular activities would help students showcase them.\nPassionate people are sought out by colleges, and extracurricular activities are a great way to show passion. Passionate people are often very committed.\nColleges want active members of society in their schools, not people who sign up for activities to be able to say they were apart of them.\nColleges know when someone signs up for a club just because they think it'll look good for college. They want people to sign up for a club because they genuinelyÂ enjoy its purpose, and not because of what it'll look like on an application. Colleges want active club members; not club members who barely go to meetings. Participating in marching band for all four years shows commitment, passion, and loyalty. Colleges want those attributes, so they are assured their students won't leave them for another college, and if they decided their major, they will stick with it. Required extracurricular activities would help students find their passions, and they would no longer wander aimlessly in life. Extracurricular activities show colleges passion, and passion is rare among teenagers. Often, passionate people go on to do great things in the world, and colleges want to have notable alumni.\nContrary to popular belief, GPA and test scores aren't everything.\nSure, they are very helpful and important on transcripts, but there are other factors colleges look at as well.\nColleges like well-rounded people.\nThis could be linked to the fact that American colleges allow their students to change their majors. If a person is well-rounded, then it is more likely that if they change their major to something completely different, they will not fail.\nBeing an active member in extracurricular activities shows that the person is not just good at memorizing notes, but that they are also able to partake in deeper thinking. Colleges want people that can use all of their brain, and not just one side of it. If someone had a perfect SAT/ACT score, a 5.0 GPA, and no extracurricular activities, they would probably not be chosen over someone with an SAT score of 1539, a 4.35 GPA and multiple extracurricular activities.\nRequired extracurricular activities would stop the person with a perfect SAT/ACT score and a 5.0 GPA from losing their spot to someone academically inferior who had more extracurricular activities. In terms of roundness, colleges want circles, not triangles.\nRequired extracurricular activities would benefit everyone. Leadership skills, passion, and appearing well rounded would enhance anyone's chances of getting into college and receiving scholarships.\nScholarships mean spending less money on college, which helps those who are paying for college. In the end, the principle's decision to require extracurricular activity participation, was a good one.",

        "Imagine, if you will, a world full of students with smart minds and massive strength. It would be the start of something beautiful. I love this plan, the thought of having every kid doing either a sport or a club they like could really help them and the whole school a lot more than just the kids that do it now. I agree with the Principal because participating in extracurricular activities would help the students get to know their peers, it would give the school an extra source of income, and finally, make the students physically and mentally stronger.\nHaving kids do extracurricular activities would help them to get to know their peers. When kids do something with one another, they get the feeling of camaraderie and friendship that usually comes with being on any sort of team, It builds a tremendous amount of trust. Furthermore, when students come home, they might not have any way to reach their friends, the after-school activities would help them stay connected to their friends. Finally, when students do anything, and win, they are given a sense of accomplishment, a sense like they could do anything in the entire world.\nPutting all the kids into extracurricular activities would generate an alternative source of income for the School. We all know that our schools are sometimes overcrowded and underfunded if we helped out by just pitching in a small fee for every child to join an after-school team or club, it would help the school have some sort of spending money so that they could get new things. Just by giving the school that small fee, we could help the kids by creating new opportunities for them, like getting them free college tours, or giving them new laptops that would allow them to make researching easier to get into better schools. And lastly, those fees would help pay the teachers salary, they are overworked and underpaid enough as it is.\nGiving the students the opportunity to go into after-school activitiesÂ would make them stronger both physically and mentally. If students join a sports team like Football or Hockey, it would make them stronger because it builds muscle and gives them purpose. Furthermore, When you look into the science behind why after-school activities are so important you would see that they make kids do better in school and at home, their entire work ethic is changed for the better. When students are both physically and mentally fit, they no longer have that craving for freedom, because they have found it in their teams, they no longer make the terrible choices that lead to them doing drugs, alcohol, or breaking laws because their freedoms are there for them.\nWhen students are placed into extracurricularÂ activities, they have more trust in their peers, they generate a new source of income for the School, and it makes the students physically and mentally fit. when we give the next generation the tools of success, we are making the world better. The science cannot lie, when placed in these situations with their peers, they come out stronger together, like a family. So, the next time that a school has a mandatory extracurricular activity to graduate, do it. Give the kids the tools to express themselves and control their own destiny.Â",

        "Do you want more stress and pressure from your schoolwork and extracurricular activity? Do you want your time with your family and friends cut short? In today's world, students usually gets too much pressure from their extracurricular activities causing them to forget about their grades and schoolwork. Students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity in school because it adds more stress to their academic and social life and it cuts the time they can us to spend their time with their family and friends.\nIn addition to that, a reason why students shouldn't be pressured into doing an extracurricular activity is because it adds more stress into their academic and social life. For example, if a student joined a sport or a musical group, students that chose a sport would put their focus in practice since the championship games may be coming up. And students that chose a musical or art activity would also put their focus in their practice time to make sure to top first in their competitions. And all the students would put their focus into their practice time to hold up the school's pride. Meanwhile, their grades may be dropping because the students aren't focused on their grades since their extracurricular activity is keeping them focus on the game or competition. Making students' school work and extracurricular activity hard to balance.\nFurthermore, another reason why students' shouldn't have the need to take an extracurricular activity is because it could cut the time they spend with their family and friends short. For example, students that chose a musical or sport as an extracurricular activity would have to do practice after schoolÂ to focus on the game or competition, and sometimes practice can be held back late since the coaches orÂ teachers want to make sure that the students are focused to hold up the school's pride. And with that, the time the students spend with their friends and family would cut short because of the need to focus on his/her extracurricular activity.\nIn conclusion, making students do an extracurricular activity would add more stress and pressure on to the student making their schoolwork hard to balance, and it cuts time off the time they spend with their family and friends. Extracurricular activities can make students' schoolwork and social life hard to balance because of their focus not being on schoolwork or social life, but on his/her extracurricular activity.

        "Imagine being in a club, the kids in it share the same interests as you. You feel at home in this club, and you can talk to your peers if you have any trouble. Making extracurricular activities, like clubs and sports, mandatory will give students opportunities to enjoy this feeling and much more. They will give kids new experiences, and help them with their social lives, I know that these are true because I joined a club once and experienced all of these things!\nWhen kids join activities, they gain new experiences that they had never had before. Firstly, they could discover hobbies, and find out that they really like something that they would have never thought to try before. There is a saying, \"\"You never know until you try\"\", and some kids need to hear this saying. They might never try to join a club unless it is mandatory, but when they do, they might find something that they really enjoy hiding in one of those activities. Also, if they already enjoy one an activity, as in sports, art, music, and others, then they can get more experience in that field. If a child really enjoys drawing, painting, and being creative, but they don't really seem to have time to practice that, they could join an art club and become better at what they enjoy. Additionally, making mandatory activities will get some kids to do something other than laze around at home. In my case, and many of my friends' as well, I have nothing to do outside of school and get bored really fast. Having a mandatory extracurricular activity will help me get outside the house and do more. For these reasons, students would get so many new, life changing experiences from mandatory extracurricular activities.\nStudents' social lives could change for the better because of this new rule. Children will make new friends during these activities. Joining clubs and teams will introduce kids to new peers, and they might even be potential friends. Moreover, making students join an activity will help them in the long run. A lot of clubs will require students to have good grades, volunteer, and more. This will be better for when children are applying for colleges and even jobs when they are older. Lastly, students will grow closer with their old friends. If students join clubs that their friends join, they can spend more time with them than they usually do. I only have half of a block with one of my closest friends, and none with the other. Joining a club together will give us much more time to talk and make awesome memories. In conclusion, making students join clubs and teams will improve their social lives.\nIn my old school, I joined the Lego club with my little sister, I didn't know many people and neither did she. My knowledge of Lego was also not very vast, but none of the other clubs had seemed appealing to me and I also owned some Lego bricksÂ at home. Prior to joining the club, my biggest, most impressive build was a multicolored box that somehow housed a small Lego girl. My sister was not anywhere as experienced than I was. In fact, she only joined because I had, and she wanted to do everything that her big sister did. The first thing we had to do in that club was to make a team and make a space themed build, and our sibling duo decided to partner up with another pair girls. We had 45 minutes, the leftover time would be for displaying the builds. When the time started, our little band of four barely talked, except for the occasional joke or two, but as time went on, we had started to open up more, and soon we couldn't build due to the amount of laughter coming out of our mouths. By the end, we had made an ugly, big, white box that a little, astronaut figurine had squished inside. A masterpiece. We couldn't even present our build due to the fits of giggles that had overcome us, but it was worth it, and my sister and I became good friends with the girls. As time went on, we got better and better at building, and I fostered a new hobby; building with Lego. As you can see, joining an extracurricular activity benefited both my sister and I, and making these activities mandatory will touch many more students.\nAlthough some students will complain against this new rule, extracurricular activities will benefit them in ways that they do not see. Their lives will be filled with interesting new memories as they get more comfortable in their club, or sport. Many more students will have a better social life, making new friends, gaining better chances at colleges and jobs, and improving their old relationships. My time at the Lego club proved these things to be true, and I believe that making mandatory extracurricular activities will help so many students. More schools should make activities mandatory, not just ours.",

        "Imagine having a long day of school, tests in all your classes, and feeling tired, then having to stay in school an extra couple hours because your school requires you to stay after school and participate in an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities are clubs and committees in school that you take part in before or after regular learning hours including sports clubs, yearbook committee, student council and more. They are great ways to keep students in touch with the school however, they should not be a requirement.Â I believe students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because students should be able to have a choice whether or not they want to come before or after school and students should not be required to stay in school longer than the required amount of hours.\nStudents should be able to have a choice if they want to participate in an extracurricular activity. If I am having a bad day or if I am tired from studying the night before I should be able to choose whether or not if I want to take part in an extracurricular that day. Furthermore, students should not be forced into having to participate in an extracurricularÂ even if they are feeling fine, they should not have to stay after school if they dont want to. An extracurricular is something that the student is interestedÂ and want to take because they want to not because the school is making them.\nStudents should not be required to stay in school longer than the required amount of hours that are set. Students already have to be in school six to seven hours a day, five days a week, there is no reason why a student should be required to stay in school longer than they already are. When the bell rings to be dismissed, I want to go home not stay in school for more time. If you want to take part in an after or before school activity that should be your own choice to come to school early or to stay after school.\nOverall, I think student should not be forced to take part in an extracurricular activity because student should be able to have a choice to take part in an extracurricular or not and students should not be required to stay in there school longer than they are required to. If a student wants to join an extracurricular activity they should but if a student does not want to the student should not have to. School days are long enough for a student especially when the student has tests they need to study for and projects that are almost due students should have to add more to his or her plate by coming before or after school if they do not want to. In the end, a student simply should not have to take part in an extracurricular activity if they do not want to.",

        "It's always nice to have students be apart of their school. Most students love after schoolÂ or in schoolÂ activities, for example the football team if this school didn't have a football team students that enjoy football would be mad. Same with every other sport, schools need to have extra activities or they will not be as good as ones that do. Students might want to switch schools if they don't have activities they enjoy, because other schools might have things they enjoy, like sports and clubs.\nIt will also make their school look better if all students are in a extracurricular activity. It could possibly expand the choices of what students might like too. There are plenty activities to choose from and students should have to at leastÂ choose one. Even if it's from cards to basketball it doesn't matter but schools should have students doing something. Schools should have a system to where you can make your own \"\"club\"\" or activity. So then if students don't like what their school offers them then they can make a activity they enjoy.\nMaking students do after school activities would also bring them closer together. They could meet new people and make more friends. Also it will overall bring the school closer together. Then everybody will know each other and mostly all kids will have friends. It is important for schools to have activities or else nobody would like the school.\nThis is why schools should have activities because they make schools look better.\nThey also help students get friends and, finally they help bring everybody closer together. So this is why schools should have extracurricular activities. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.\nThe first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there.\nAlso, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects.\nSecondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a painÂ to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for.\nFinally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.\nForcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.Â Â Â Â",

        "Making students participate in a extracirricular activity would be a good idea. Extracirricluar activities can help students gain more experience of physical strength, social activity and interaction, and new learning experiences. For example; A student who plays football outside of school can strengthen their physical and social health by playing with other team mates and working out at the same time, while maintaing new knowledge about the sport which would include new learning experiences too.\nParticipating in other activites outside of school can help a student figure out their true interests and help them discover carrers for the future. Making students try and learn something new can be beneficial if they are having trouble finding what peaks their interest. However, there may be some downfalls to this new idea. Extracirricular activites may sometimes not be so easy to manage. Especially with sports or activites for the school. Some activites can make students weeks feel stressful and overwhelming at times. Sometimes actvities can mess with the students outside life such as; traveling, family, religious purposes, etc.\nActivites that are easily able to maintain with the persons schedule and peaks the students interest should be acceptable to participate in. New opportunities could come up for the student reguarding to college or even future jobs. If a student decides to choose this activity in the future, companies would see that they have extra experience and might increase their chance of giving or accepting job offers to that particular student. If he/she works hard in school and maintains a healthy schedule that would not affect them severly, the student might get a scholarship from many different colleges and major in that specific category.\nHe/she might even make new friends in their new activity and might increase their chance of wanting to continue doing the program with them. Making new friends is also beneficial and could help increase the persons chance of wanting to continue participating in this new sport or activity.\nOverall, making students participate in extracirricular activites outside of school or for the school would be great to improve the students physical, social, and emotional health, help the sudent gain more knowledge about the acitvity, and decide future carrers and interests.",

Sitting at home all the time is not healthy for anybody, many people can become depressed, lonely or just really bored. Getting out of the house more, you can get more exercise. Its healthier to be around people then to be alone all the time at home.\nThis is also a really good way to make new friends.

That being said you would get along more because you can tak about you similar hobby.\nAlot of kids go home and become bored because tey have nothing to do.

        "I agree that students should participate in extracurricular activities because, sometimes kids go home and have nothing to do and just sit around the rest of the day after coming home from school. Secondly, there is a vast number of students that dont participate in any activities at all. Doing sports and other activities could probably help some students a lot. You can hang out with friends while doing these activities which can make the activity more fun. Lastly, Everyone is always mostly on there phone so they dont do anything productive.\nMost of the time when kids get home they just lay around the rest of the day. Which is very boring, and not fun at all. Doing an extracurricular activity can stop you from being bored the rest of the day. When some students are bored they eat junk food, which is not healthy at all. Thats why some parents shouldn'tÂ let there child sit around all day. This happens very often where kids gain a lot of weight just from being bored. This can lead to a lot of health problems and i dont think anyone wants that for there kid. Nobody would want to see their kid really sick\nWhen doing these activities you can ask a friend to join you if they are not in any activities either. Asking a friend to join can probably make you enjoy the activity more. Maybe you might think the activity is boring and would be better enjoyed if a friend joined you so you can have someone to talk to. Having no oneÂ to talk to makes it boring and makes you want to quit. You can also meet new people and make new friends with the people that are also in these activities. So inviting a friend who isn't in any activities could probably help them too.\nEveryone is always on their phone and they really care about these activities. Sometimes students are more worried about playing a game on there phone or TVs when they get home. Thats these are even relevant for them. Additionally, They should talk about it more often in schools so the kids will see just staying home and doi9ng nothing isn't healthy and they at least should do sports or something productive. And being in front of a screen all day can damage your eyes. I don't blame them because being on your phone is basically like an addiction. Since there is so much to do on your phone instaed of actually going outside and doing things.\nIn conclusion, Being in a extracurricular activity could probably help improve your grades, your social skills, and your performance in school overall. It may even help improve some people grades, because a lot of people werent really focused on this type of stuff but joining an activity may help. It can help with boredom if students have nothing to do at home. It can also give them some fresh air if students are doing sports because they are technically cramped in a classroom and get stuck in busy hallways the whole day. So i agree that joining a extracurricular activity would be a good impact on school life.Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Shoot the ball! Quickly! Swish that was the sound of my team winning the playoffs. Our principal decided that every student should attend at least on extracurricular activity. His decision has impacted us in a positive way. It's safe to say that I agree with his decision. An extracurricular activity can improve one's life emotionally, and physically.\nOne gain in attending an extracurricular activity is that it can fix a persons body weight. For instance, being in a sports team or cheer leadingÂ requires a healthy diet and working out. If you don't complete these two tasks it could have you kicked from the team. This emphasizes the fact that an extracurricular activity such as sports can improve one's health. Who doesn't want to be healthy? Being in the basketball team overweight is a tough job. Especially when the students in the team must go to practice almost everyday. When they go to practice, they improve their skills in basketball and their stamina meaning they have to run a lot, it can be for any sport. Since the person is already doing their workout in practice, all they have to do outside is eat healthy. Now thats easy! Within months this person could have lose tons of weight and maybe even started to get abs. Sports, an extracurricular activity, has already knocked down the health factor in ones life.\nSocial life is another factor in which an extracurricular activity touches upon. It can help someone make new friends that take interest in the same things as themself. One can join the art or the yearbook editing club and meet people that enjoy drawing, and painting as much as them. That student could potentially have found a new friend that they can share their stories or ideas with. This shows that just one extracurricular activity could bring a student one step closer to their peers. This works the same with any sport as well. Sports also have the ability to make a student connect with others. Moreover, it can help a person communicate better with the friends they already have. If one is having difficulty coming up with ideas to talk about with their friends, they can join a club or do sports. This will give each of them something to talk and discuss about. They could talk about how practice was or what they drew in the art club today. These extracurricular activities provide some people with something to talk about with their friends.\nAn extracurricular activity can help with teamwork, being open to other people's ideas, and sharing a student's own ideas. It can improve the way students consider other ideas coming from different people. If a student decides to serve the student council they have to think about all the others that are also a part of their team. These students have to keep in mind that students around the school might give suggestions on what one should improve. This means that an activity such as, this one can improve the way a student might think about an idea a different student could have suggested. Since, these students are in the student council they have to find a way to come up with a decision that implements everyone's ideas. If a student is working on the yearbook they must find a way to add every person's art in it. Even if it means changing it up a little. Teamwork is a big part of joining an extracurricular activity. Though one may not like a person who is the same club, one still has to consider their thoughts as well. Furthermore, a student might not have the confidence to share their own ideas until they join a club or extra activity. When this person see's that people in the student council are being open about their ideas, he/she might start to share. Hiding ideas inside of one may not show their full potential. Extracurricular activities help get rid of that fear a students might have.\nExtracurricular activities can make one more confident in their own ability. It not only enhances a student's social skills but also creates a path to a better school life. I believe that the principal's decision wasÂ impactful because of all the benefits one can get. Teamwork, health, and social life are not the only enhancements that extracurricular activities provide a student and the whole school with. Lets go collect our trophy guys!!!",

        "Some peopleÂ may think that forcing kids into doing extra circulars, could help them in the future but what if these kids have other reasons that they cant participate in these actives? If my principal tried to force students into doing extra circulars, I would disagreeÂ because, there is a large amount of families who will not be able to pay, Students could already have other commitments out of school and making students participate could end up hurting their grades.\nFirst off, In most countries and the United States Poverty rates are very high, meaning more and more families could struggle to let alone put food on the table, then making their kids do a sport that could cost hundreds of dollars may not be possible for lots of families. Sports teams like basket ball or soccer, usually have away games. That could mean having to stay over night, which is also very expensive leaving the families already very pressed on money, to not be able to go or have to rely on other for somewhere to sleep and eat. Even if the Students of these families are thinking of doing the play or debate team, there is usually still some sort of fee to join, or get the shirts and go to events, still leaving families to not have the money needed to participate.\nAnother reason forcing students to do an school activity is what they are committed to out of school. Students may have to babysit there younger sibling after school, so making the student stay after school one to five times a week. Would force the family to find another way to get the younger sibling taken careÂ of. Sports out of school, most school dont have every sport a student wants to play, forcing the students to join somewhere else. these practices could take up most of their time, so making the students to another activity could end up leaving them no free time, or even having to quit their original sport.\nLastly, if the students actually want to do the sport or activity. There are usually tons of practices leading them to have not much free time in betweenÂ school and practice. If the student starts to slip on school work and not turn in missing assignments, their grades could and will drop very low. Some kids know how to balance out work and sports, but not all do, so forcing all kids to take away an large amount of time from where they do their homework, Could also end up hurting not just the kids but the schools grade average may go down to.\nIn conclusion, Forcing kids into doing an Extra circular activity, could end poorly due to, families not have the finances to pay, Students having other commitments out of school and the possibility of students grades being effected poorly by the amount of work need in sports and clubs. If my principle was making a rule forcing every student to participate in an extra circular activity, I would have to disagree with their choices and thoes are my reasons why.",

I believe that schools should require every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they, build friendshipsÂ outside of school, take the students' mind off the stresses of school and strengthen the body and mind.\nExtracurricular activities build close bonds outside of school in many ways. They require students to get to know each other better than if they met at school, such as if they have different classes or friend groups. They Strengthen bonds that have already been formed, like those between two students that share a class. They allow for in inclusion of every student who participates in these activities.\nExtracurricular activites are a very good way to relieve stress from school. Such as, if a student has had a bad day at school they can particiapate in their activity and release some of that stress. They also require students to think about things other than school. If a student is having issues with a certain subject in school, they can go to a team practice and stop thinking about that subject for a while. School based extracurricular activities also help form bonds between students and teachers, leading to a higher chance of a student asking for help in class.\nFinally, extracurricular activities also help stregthen the body and mind. Students may participate in a book club or the debate team which help build confidence and intelligence therefore increasing school capabilities. However, sports like football or basketball help build physical strength and endurance. Participating in multiple extracurricular activities such as football and the cybersecurity team would be a perfect combination for building strength and intelligence.\nThe requirement of extracurricular activities is a very beneficial thing interms of building friendships, relieving stress and building physical and mental strength. All of these together create a very good reason why the principle should require every student to participate in at least one or more extracurricular activites.

Students worry about the activities and could get distracted. More projects or work having to deal with.

Students could also stress parents with projects and more work from the activities that they have to deal with. For example, my friend Generic_Name gets stressed with the work he already has in class and a extracurricular activity would not be very helpful for him.\nFurthermore, students would have less time in their regular helpful classes. Having less time in their regular classes makes teachers also stress. Teachers have less time in class to teach students what they need to learn. Students learn less and goof more around in the activities. The grades of students could decreaseÂ badly because they are not learning enough.

The reason of why some students are not good at sports could be that they think they are not physically fit, they might not understand how the sport works, or the student simply does not enjoy having to move or run a lot.

Apart from that being pressure into doing something could cause have negative thoughts on the brain which could effect academic skills.\nIn conclusion it should not be mandatory for students to have to do an extracurricular activity because, students should be able to enjoy doing other activities outside of school, doing an activity such as a sport could require skill and before hand knowledge on sports, and most students that are anti social should not feel being pressured into having to do an activity which requires socialization.Â Â",

        "Dear, Principal\nMost people disagree with your decision to force all students to have an extracurricular activity for many but, fair reasons. The problems with forcing students to participate in aÂ extracurricularÂ activity are hard to miss. Most students are only able to work on homework for three hours. Students will feel exhaustedÂ ate school from the extra activities that happenÂ every week day. The students grades will plummet making the school look like a failure. This is why you must change your decision.\nFirst, many students struggle to get their work done in the provided time frame but since most of the extracurricular activities take place after school they won't be able to get their work done. When someone takes away time from the time period the students need they feel like they have to carry the weight of the world by themselves and then they break under the pressure. Some students have preplanned activities with their families who they now can't spend time with. The extra work puts too much pressure on the students. Without time students will ether stay up late or watch as their grades quickly decline.\nSecond, You will see students come in later and less awake because they are suffering from sleep deprivation. When people are tired they are most likely become unhappy and easily agitated. With bad attitudesÂ the school will have to give out more detentions then ever before.\nWith more students becoming exhausted students will not pay attention which could become a serious problem students could miss important announcements.\nThird, a problem caused by exhaustion can be bad grades. With worse grades summer school attendance will sky rocket making more people give up their summer. With worse grades more common students aren't the only ones suffering, teachers and principles could be under observation by the county or even be fired. With being kicked out of extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ no longer being a consequence of bad grades the number students going to the school could decrease. With parents wanting their kids to succeed in school the student population will shrink.\nWith out you changing your choiceÂ many problems will be caused for the school. First, without enough time students stay up late. Then, after staying up late they become exhausted. Finally, Without proper rest the grades will decline. So remember, only you can change what you choseÂ so please reconsider for the school and the students' sake.\nSincerely, Anyomous",

An example if you're helping make the year book you get to learn how to use editing software. kids wouldn't get this opportunityÂ if they never wanted to do it in the first place. But, if it's mandatory you wouldn't need to worry about this because the school would do you a favor. If your kid doesn'tÂ want to do it the activities eventually get better and more fun so it'll rope them into it.\nIf your kid is shy nothing is better than getting them some experienceÂ with talking. They'll be doing a lot more talking when they join an activity they'll never wanna leave. They get to work in teams and talk to each other and have fun. whenever they get into the real world they'll need to know how to work with people. It may be hard for them to listen to that much talking but it builds their endurance to withstand that amount of talking.\nDid i mention they can also make friends if schools don't make you do those activities most kids won't have friends. It's really hard to make friends but if you're seeing the same people everyday during those activities you form a bond. If you don't want your kid to have friends you can always tell them to not make any friends. But, whats the harm in making friends. They can make friends if you want them to and it'll be a lot easier to because you're close to other people.\nwe should have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they get experience in the activity the're doing, they learn to work in teams, and they can make friends.

        "School is a place of learning. It can also be a place to get to know new people. But school lacks student participation in after school activities. Our principle has decided that all students should participate in at leastÂ one after school activity. The reason why students should participate in an after school activity is sports, students council, and the yearbook.\nThe first reason why students should participate in an after is sports. Sports is a great way for the school to be recognized by colleges. Scouts from colleges will want to come to our games to draft kids into their college. Sports will also get the school trophies for students to brag about. Because of all of the trophies the other school sport teams will recognize the school as an actual challenge to go against.\nThe second reason why students should participate in an after school activity is the student council. The student council can encourage the school to do more fun activities for the students. The students council represents the students, so the students will be able to have a voice. ThereforeÂ the council will know what to focus on for the schools.\nThe final reason why students should participate in after school activities is the year book. Having students as photographer will mean they will take decent pictures. With a lotÂ of students in the yearbook club there will be many pictures to pick from. The yearbook club will make sure students will have memories of the school.\nThe reason why schools should participate in an after school activity is sports, student council, and yearbook. Sports will help students get recognized by scouts, the sport team will be an actual challenge to beat, and the school will have a lot of trophies. The student council will try to get more fun activities, students will have a voice, the student council will know what to focus on. The yearbook will get students to take good pictures, because of the number of students the yearbook club will have a lot of pictures to choose from, the yearbook club will make sure the students will have memories of the year they had at school. The school needs more participation from the students. With a lotÂ of people participating in after school activities it can make the school a more fun place.",

        "\"\"My biggest in life is to help kids believe that they can be anything when they grow up.\"\"-Kobe Bryant. School is not only for learning but also for helping students practice valuable life skills. As most students think that school is just about learning, it is also teaching them important skills that they need to know later in life. Therefore, having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a good idea because it helps students work on important skills such as collaboration, creativity, and hard working.\nCollaboration I think is the most important skill to have to know on this list. Not only will you have toÂ know how to talk properly at work, you will also need to know how to talk properly anywhere you go. That is why the more you talk to people in a group the more you help your collaboration skills. Collaboration doesn't always have to be oral. It can be done when texting someone. Make sure you think before you speak also that is on where everyone has trouble on, even adults.\nCreativity can be good be bad. It can be good if your on a sports team and your need to make an exciting play. Creativity can also be found in artwork. Only the most beautiful artwork is fond from a creativeÂ artists. Now the reason creativity can be bad is if you take the lazy way out. By that I mean, say John's mom tells him to take out the trash but he don't feel like doing it, he then realizes that the trash can was left open. He decide to shoot the trash like it's a basketball in the trash. John then misses and he is left with a pile of trash to clean up. That is how creativity can be bad.\nA hard working person is a person who he/she puts effort into something to get it done. The more someone says they can't, the more they're telling their brain to just give up. But the more they tell themselves they can then they can do it. Just think of Jason Pierre Paul. He plays for the PhiladelphiaÂ Eagles. When he lost his arm as a young boy he though heÂ would never be able to play in the NFL with his brother. But he didn't quit and he showed the world how much effort he put into wanting to play in the NFL. He went on to win best defenses man of the year award. All because of his hard work.\nIn conclusion having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a great way to help students practice their collaboration skills, creativity skills, and hardworking skills. Every body needs to start learning these skills at a young age. So they can grow up to be a civilized human being. All we need is some modern civilized people. If we had them this world would be a better place to live in.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "You may think students should have to do an activity, but should they really be forced to? Students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity be fore, after, or during school. Being forced into something makes kids want to do it less, and doesn't give them the freedom and choice they deserve to have. Extracurricular activities take time and some students may be busy with things like homework or, at this age, working for a little bit of spending money. They also take away from time that could be spent with their families and unwinding after their school day has ended.\nFirstly, in middle school, kids are around the ages of 11-15, and they should be considered old enough to make their own decisions. Forcing somebody to do something is never considered a fun thing, or something you'd want yourself. This can lead to more misbehaving, and purposefully missing these activities. Giving the students the choice of doing an extracurricular activity would stop them from misbehaving or coming up with excuses to get out of something they may not want to do. And, let's face it, teenagers are at the stage where they would rather misbehave than listen to authorities, so it would be better to let them have their own choice in the matter.\nSecond, students may already be doing something after school everyday, meaning they don't have the time to do it in the afternoon. Some kids may have a lot of homework assigned to them by their teachers. Some students may already be doing a sport or activity after school that isn't for the school, maybe for the county or the town. Many students are given a lot of homework in middle school,or have plans after school. Which brings me to my next point.\nExtracurricular activities take precious time away from students. This time could be better spent making stronger bonds with their family members, or hanging out with brothers or sisters. While some people may not have siblings, this point still stands. A lot of kids' families are busy, and the one day they aren't they may have a sport or an after school group meeting. Some kids may have family visiting that they only get to see a few times a year, and it would be better for them to spend time with their loved ones instead of running around and kicking or throwing a ball or sitting and talking about school issues.\nIn conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities or sports after school without their consent. They miss time that could be spent with their families, or time that could be used on their in school work or spent on activities they may have that aren't from the school. They also should have the choice to do what they would like to, as they are in middle school and are not just little kids anymore. While you may think this was a good idea, the students and I disagree, and would like our choices back. It would be best for the school's reputation amongst parents and their kids and it would be best for the students themselves to not have to participare in an extracurricular activity.",

        "I highly disagree with the Principal's decision that students have to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity. I believe that students should be able to choose whether or not do a after schoolÂ activity. Most of the time kids are exhausted from a long day of school, and want to rest once they get home ,they can't do that if they have an after school activity they have to go to. Often times people have to go home and take care of there younger sibling or other family obligations that are way more important then an after school activity. Some students already have mandatory sport practices and if they do have an after school activity right before it they are just going to waste their energy on that and will be tired for practice. Some work part time jobs after school to help support their family. There are so many more important obligations and they should notÂ have to stay after.\nExtracurricular activities are extra for a reason. Extraculicalar activities aren't part of the school day so we should not be forced to stay after. There are students that just dont like after schoolÂ activities. There is never going to be an activity available that interests everyone. When children's options are taken away such as having to stay for a extracurricular activity they like it less. They like having the option to stay after or to not stay after. Once it becomes mandatory and not a option to stay after it just feel like a chore that has to be done, but you dont want to do. Some students are simply not comfortable with after school activities because, they dread the thought of social interaction, and might be shy. They already have to deal with being scared of social interaction at school but then after school and it just makes them even more stressed and anxious. Kids like to take a break and have fun with their friends after schoolÂ and much rather do that.\nThe students will have less time to do their homework. When students stay after they have less time to do their homework or school projects. Students often stay up all night just to get there projects done or even study. School work is way more important than extracurricular activities. When a student has to do so many things at once they get very stressed and worn out. A kid might have to stay after then right after have practice for a sport then after have to work on a project till late. When students Sleep late they have even less energy at school the next day and often wont even be able to pay attention without falling asleep. If students have a test the next day they wont be awake enough to even remember the right answers.\nIn conclusion I do not agree\nI think that there is no reason for the principal to make everyone do an extracurricular activity extracucilar activities should be a choice. most have sports,jobs,family obligations,,just dont wanna go or have school work that needs to be done. After school being mandatory takes freedom away and as a child you already dont have much freedom so you should be able to choose whether or not you stay after. If a student likes after schoolÂ then they will stay after school ,but if a student doesnt stay after they obviously dont due to not wanting to or having obligations. Students are stressed enough with school work and projects to be having to do a after school activity. The students will not enjoy it if it is mandatory because children like having freedom. I disagree with the principals decision.",

        "Have you ever wanted to be in a club but were afraid of meeting people? Did you ever think about expanding your mind in trying something different or challenging? Or, maybe, you just wanted to join ceramics or drama? Many of us, especially teens, worry about talking to new peers of ours. so we never try it. If we never attempt to go the extra mile to do something, we might miss out on the chance of meeting a life long confidant. After-school activities guide us into doing things out of our comfort zones to enjoy many unknown hobbies. These special groups provide such enjoyment and laughter to thousands of children. I agree with the decision that all students may participate in at least one extracurricular because it takes away unnecessary stress, gives new topics to learn about, and students can make new friends.\nFirst, learners should take at least one extracurricular because it removes unneeded stress. For example, it creates an enjoyable part of school at the end of the day. As every teacher knows, students don't favor school very much and adding an exciting aspect to it will let them relieve all that built up information about tests and homework. Also, this provides a way of releasing all stress by having a specific time that contributes to doing so. When kids don't go straight home and start their homework, they feel more at ease and relaxed about their schoolwork and don't feel pressured. Furthermore, clubs let young thinkers forget about the crazy nonsense that might've occurred at school that day. Maybe students got sent to the office and are worked up about that, this assists them by going somewhere where no one judges you and keeps you as calm as possible. Therefore, removing stress is a big factor on why learners should participate in an extracurricular.\nSecond, these activities give new topics to learn about. For instance, many young adults might be unsure about their interests, and they could make it clear for themselves. You might believe you hate art, but when you join the school club for it, it could be your dream profession to become an artist. Everyone will be able to discover their passions at their own pace. Additionally, if a person wants to be apart of a cultural learning group, it will grow their mind to understand different races and nationalities to compare to their own. While attempting to understand a unknown area, children enrich their knowledge of the world. Moreover, teens can have an opportunity to talk and address issues that are not taught in the classroom. They might touch on World War II in History, but if they want to go into it more in depth, World War II Club will provide them with that. In summary, extracurricular gives brand new items to go deeper into, which helps in the many ways listed above.\nLastly, people can make new friends. Many professors and parents believe that pushing our kids to meet new peers is wrong and shouldn't be accepted. They say that they should gradually build up the courage to speak up. But why not head startÂ them into the path of publicly speaking to people they don't know. Many children haven't been taught how to be confident, so I believe adding these activities will add that to the curriculum. When put in these groups, students are exposed to others with unique backgrounds. They all can share their own point of views to start up collaboration, which can lead to becoming best friends forever. Another point is the freedom of seeing people outside of your classes is added. When you have a pattern of saying hi to a variety of colleagues, you make more connections that could possibly last a lifetime. Introverts also have the chance of conversing very often. They are sometimes misunderstood and handing them a way of being understood might let them open up a bit. All in all, knowing new faces and personalities could create a way of adding friends.\nIn conclusion, I agree with the decision that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it removes stress, it promotes the making of new friends, and gives a variety of topics to learn about. Every teenager should go out and try something they haven't. They should understand that this new rule actually benefits them in ways that they never even noticed. You need to take risks to have new experiences in your life to look back on. \"\"New and \"\"different\"\" might be scary words to hear, but sometimes change and interaction is fascinating. Just take that leap of faith, and everything will work out in the end. When you join that ceramics club, all your fears of people and challenge will go away. Your mind will expand, and it could turn out to be your passion.",

Some schools make their students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity whether the students want to or not, the students don't really have a say. I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity.

There are many reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity. Some reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity is simply because they might not have time, their parents may not want them to, and they might just not be interested in extracurricular activities at the moment.\nHaving to take an extracurricular activity is a big responsibility in a way. Students might not have time because just like anybody else they also have a life outside of school and they have things that they need to do everyday. They might need to watch their siblings while their parents are at work, also they have homework for almost every class and apart from that they still have to do chores around the house. The students might really wantÂ to do a sport or join a club or maybe even do both but they might not be able to. The reason being is because they would then have to go after school so that they can go to practice for a sport or meet up with the other people from the club. There's a specific time you have to be there and if you can't make it you might get kicked out of the club or sport or any other extracurricular activities.\nNot having enough time might not be an issue but maybe their parents just dont want them to participate in anything. There are many reasons as to why this can happen, the student might get hurt really easily if its a sport or maybe even by doing simple everyday things, their parents might not be able to take them back to school when school is over because they might not have transportation, the parents could even possibly think that its dumb. There are many more reasons as to why their parents might just not want them to join a club or a sport or even just an after school class. The parents have their reasons because it's their child and they want to do what's best.\nLastly the student might just not want to do anything at the moment.

They might be thinking about doing sports or something else this upcoming year but just notÂ now. students get really stressed with all the work that they get that they might just notÂ want to add more stress by having one more thing to worry about. maybe they are military and they might have to moveÂ to a whole different place where they don'tÂ know anyone so they want to take a year off to get to know some people before they start joining anything.\nStudents shouldn't be made to take an extra curricular activity because they simply might not have time, their parents might just not want them to, or they might just not want to take any extracurricular activities at the moment. They should be able to have a choice of whether they want to take an extracurricular course or not.

Incorporating these subjects into school extracurricularÂ clubs would be difficult due to high equipment costs, lack of space, lack of widespread interest, or several other reasons. For example, some students consider fencing to be their favorite activity. However, the equipment required to do fencing is expensive and prone to breaking. This may not be extremely hard for one person to afford, but starting a school fencing club would require the school to buy several sets. Furthermore, fencing also requires a 14 meter strip as well as extra room so other students will not get hit by any stray blades. The school's resources are limited, and could not sponsor an activity like this without the kind of support that only mainstream sports have. In the meantime, it is not fair to the students who fence to force them into another activity when they could be practicing fencing outside of school.\nExtracurricular activities take up time that would be better spent elsewhere. School already takes up a large chunk of the day, but by requiring students to do extracurricular activities, kids are forced to stay for one or two more hours doing activities that do not seem worth spending time on. If a student chooses to join an extracurricular because they wanted to and not because it was required, the activity wouldn't seem like a waste of time. For the other students, however, those few hours could be spent on homework, catching up on sleep, connecting with friends and family, or pursuing their interests outside of school. Many students are on sports travel teams, and they need the time to practice with their team. Some people take classes outside of school or just prefer to do activities they like at home. Although these students are not joining school clubs, they are still doing extracurricular activities and should be able to continue doing so without worrying about running out of time for homework or missing out on sleep.\nForcing people to participate in an extracurricular activity would ruin the experiences of other students. Making extracurricular activities a requirement would cause people to join clubs without genuine interest in the activity. These students will show less enthusiasm and put in less effort towards club activities and can drag things down for other students. They could be unwilling to do work or serve as a distraction to other students. There is a similar situation in elective courses, where some students only select a course because they believe it will be an easy class. Those students tend to participate less or be loud and off-topic. During group projects, they don't contribute as much. For many other students, it is frustrating to deal with these people, especially since there is no common interest in the activity they are doing.\nRequiring participation in extracurricular activities ultimately does more harm than good to students because it disregards that broad range of activities students enjoy and takes valuable time from students who should be free to choose how to spend it. It also detracts from the value of extracurricular activities- which are created by people cooperating and acting on a common interest -by adding people who don't enjoy the activity. Inspiring students to be curious and passionate should be the school's priority, but by requiring students to do an extracurricular club the schools are only boxing students into a mold that ignores the complexity and individuality of each person. Students are required to get an education that will help them survive as adults, but they should be able to decide which hobbies and skills they want to specialize in. In the end, the unique path they decide to carve out for themselves should be of their own making.",

      essay:
        'Almost 50% of students in our school sign up for extracurricular activities. That is half of our school! But, there is another half to our school who do not participate in extracurricular activities. They all have their own reasons to not take part in these activities and should not be penalized for a reason which they might not be able to avoid. Therefore, I disagree with our principles decision to make it mandatory for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students need that extra time to dedicate it towards their family and other activities that they go to which they prefer over the ones in school, they might feel various negative effects due to these activities, and they also might dislike the options that they are provided with in school.\nStudents need this extra time to use it for their families and other recreational things they do after school.. They might have to hurry to their homes because they have to pick up their siblings. I know many who go home quickly without any hesitation because they have to pick up his or her young sister or brother who can\'t walk home from where his or her school bus stops by themselves. Many students live far away and do not get a school bus and could get tired after an after schoolÂ activity, making them unable to walk to their homes. Now, unless they can take the bus to near their homes or have a parent or guardian pick them up, this will be very problematic for them, especially for the people who decide to take part in a sports activity. People also sign up for other things that amuse them after school. For example, a student might have been part of a soccer team which they played for and trained with after school. This necessity of having to go to an after school activity becomes a huge roadblock if they want to really succeed as a soccer player or any sport in general. All in all, over usage of time by our school seems to be a big problem caused by these activities.\nSchools are funded based off of how their students perform and these after school activities play a role in grade drops. Learners are often stressed out in school already because heavy loads of homework or assignments in school and extracurricular activities will more likely stress them out furthermore. The likelihood of an after school activity which isn\'t fun and requires you to study in a boring way, is high. Our school even makes us do homework for 3/4 of Gaming club where we are supposed to be having fun and gaming with our friends. Which also leads me to the point that some activities are misleading. Students get upset when they realize that they signed up to do homework for almost the entire time in Gaming club. Once students get a firm grasp of the idea that the activities that they are doing are not serving their purpose, they will lose interest in those activities and maybe even school. Loss of interest in school is already caused by the core subjects. And placing down more things for students to learn makes them more viable to give up on school. Basically, schools would be seen as manipulating and stressing their students out to what they think ""benefits"" them.\nTeachers and the school, and of course mainly our principle, may think that putting down a rule to have to be ""using your time for learning and having fun"" makes us more productive. But in reality, it very much does not. The country with the best education system does not force work onto students by putting down homework on their backs. They instead, educate them in a fun and memorable way. Students will remember the time that they all hopped in a Minecraft server to learn math, and will most likely forget the time that they had to do five pages of math homework for two hours straight just to get a C on that homework. The manipulative part about these activities do not help the school in any way. Deceptive ways to get your students to work will backfire. So, schools should just approach this situation with more concern for the students.\nAll schools are not like this, so why should we be. Tricking our students to ""learn"", using up their time to force them to, once again, ""learn"" and stressing them our with these activities to make them ""learn"" should not be the way to go. School should invest more time listening to the voices of the students that they teach and adapt to modern times. Everything changes to fit the standards of modern society. Why should our school not do the same?',

        "How would you feel if your school district made you participate in an extracurricular activity? You may feel angry, or you may be exited. Some some students love being involved in fun activities like a sports team, or art club. Others have a good reason why they don't enjoy that experience. I believe that it's not fair to force students to participate in extracurricular activities because serious events at home may be taking up their time, they may have learning disabilities, and because it's another opportunity for bullying to occur.\nImagine that your mom is in the hospital, or your sister has anxiety and depression, and you want to spend time with them. Then your school district decides that everyone has to be involved in an after school program, and now you cant spend as much time with your loved one as a result of the time commitment. This is why I think it's important to let the students decide weather they want to do an extra activity or not. What if someone you where close with recently passed away, and you dont feel like doing extra activities? Than you wouldn't show up, and be marked absent. This is why I believe that we should not make students participate in after school activities.\nHave you ever had a to finish work from school at home? This is unfortunately common for students with learning disabilities. If students with who spent a lotÂ of time doing school work where involved with an after school activity, they may have no choice but to stay up late in the night doing homework. I myself have a mild learning disability, and its not uncommon for me to come home from school with unfinished school work that I have to finish by next class. It truly is unfair for the school district to force students to do extra activities which are supposed to be optional, and I hope they never do that in Fairfax County.\nAs many people know, bullying is a problem at many schools. Students hear the constant bickering, and teasing that often means that someone is getting bullied. This is another reason why I think that schools should not make their students participate in after school activities. Some students who get bullied at school laughÂ then so they don't appear a certain way to the people around them, when really they're holding back tears. After school is just another opportunity for a bully to strike, and a more welcoming opportunity at that. When you stay after school, their are less teachers and students around, making the bully more likely to act then. One day I hope that adults realize how difficult it can be to come to school and stay after to.\nI think that students should not be required to stay after school because of serious events at home are more important, some students have learning disabilities, and after school is just another opportunity for bullying to occur. I hope that next time you find yourself requiring someone to stay after school, remember to listen to and consider the person you're requirings concerns.Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Everyday you see kids participating in football, baseball, basketball, and other extracurricular activities, it is part of the balanced day for most kids. Extracurricular activities are important and enjoyed by most, but I believe children should not be forced to do activities like sports or clubs. Even though extracurricular activities are important they are hard for some to do. Many parents and kids nowadays don't have time for these activities with all the work and homework they have to do. Also some kids have disabilities or mental disabilities that cause problems when they are trying to do activities like football or yearbook club. In my opinion forcing extracurricular activities on kids is wrong because some parents and kids don't have time, and some kids with disabilities or mental disabilities might have trouble with rigorous activity.\nIn schools all across America kids have homework, it's unavoidable, children have to work hard no matter which school they go to. Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others. In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities. Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress. Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule. An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents. This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time.\nIn many American schools kids are burdened by a disability or mental disability. These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil. This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities. The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids. It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work. Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case. While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricularÂ activities because of their underlying issues.\nThis is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lotÂ of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities justÂ don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong. I can't believe the principal is even considering doing this, but what do you think? Should extracurricular activities be required?Â Â",

I think participating in an activity would be a good way to go out and meet new people. You can meet people who are very fun to hang out with. It would be a good way to open out and instead of staying home you can be at school doing after school activities. For example I use to be scared doing after school activities because I was new and I didn't know anyone but I signed up for football and i got to know other people and I started to like playing football.Â I also stayed for other sports and I met so many peopleÂ and got closer to them andÂ I was really happy because I wouldnt have to be home being bored all the time.\nTrying out new things would also be fun and you can learn how to play a new sport and become good at it. Other activities like the year book is also fun because you can be creative with the book. Doing the year book can teach you many things and it can let out a lot of stress and can relax you. I would also find it fun doing the yearÂ book because I've always wonder how you make the year book and when they come out they always look very pretty.\nI think it would be fun for people to try new things to be adventurous and stay at school doing fun activities. It's fun playing or being creative and being around people who are also fun.

        'You have just scored the game winning goal for your soccer team. ""Goal"", the crowd roars. Your team crowds around you with joy. This is a famillar feeling for students who take part in extracurricular activities. Whether its the newspaper club, robotics club, or the football team. These students get to feel a sense of acomplishment when he or she takes part in extracurricular activities. Therefore all students should be required to take part in an extracurricular activity. Joining these activities will help students make friends, explore future carrer options, and learn life lessons.\nStudents will be able to make new friends if they are required to take extracurricular activities. For example they will be able to find students with simillar hobbies as them. To add on students will learn communication skills which they can use to make firends. For instance if a student were to join soccer they would have to talk to eachother to know who to pass the ball to and when. Lastly they will meet more of their new peers who are also apart of the same club or sport who they might have not ever met before. In conclusion extracurricular activities help students make friends.\nExtracurriculars also help students explore future carrer options. First of all students can figure out what they are good at and explore future jobs that match those skills. For example if a student was in the yearbook club and he or she was really good at drawing they could look into future carrers as an artist or graphic designer. Also speakers come in every two months and speak about their jobs and how students could pursue their dream jobs. Furthermore students have a chance to get a scholarship to college for doing a sport. Then they could continue that sport in college. Also being good at a sport will make it easier for them to get into their dream college. Which is why extracurriculars help students explore future carrer choices.\nLastly by requiring students to take extracuriculars students learn important life lessons. For example student learn how to be good leaders. This is because in extracuriculars there is always a captain selected if you are selected as captain you learn how to be a good leader but, if u aren\'t selected as the leader you learn how to be a team player and how to follow a leader. To add on you learn how to balance your time. Therefore you must be able to keep up with all the stuff you have to do in your club and your school work at the same time. Lastly another life lesson you learn in clubs is how to communicate properley and respectfully with your fellow peers. These are a few of the may life lessons you learn while taking part in an extracurricular activity.\nAll students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurriculars encourage and help students make friend, explore future carrer options, and learn life lesseon. As a student body we must stress to all students how important it is to follow the principals wishes and, join extracurricular activities. Â Â Â',

        "Imagine being on a field and you just scored the winning goal while your school is chanting your name. Being involved in an extracurricular activity at your school can have so many benefits and even receiving little compliments that make your day can be a benefit. Students should participate in at least one extra curricular activity because they can show off their talents,have fun,and develop life skills.\nOne benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity is that students can get a chance to show off their talents such as in sports. A student could be insecure about other things going on in their life like family issues or friendship problems and they could have this one activity that can make them feel good and proud about themselves. Being proud of yourself is a very important aspect and everyone should have something they are proud about so they can show it. Another amazing part about showing off your talent is that it could influence others to try and find their hidden talent. You could change someone's life by influencing them and all they might have needed was somebody to reassure them to try. Lastly,it can make the people around you proud such as your family,friends,school and community. Knowing you made the people who love you proud is heartwarming and everyone should be able to experience that. Showing your talent is not the only benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity.\nAnother benefit you can get from joining an activity at school is you get to have fun such as working on the yearbook. Having the same everyday routine after schoolÂ can be very boring and you could get tired of it so changing your schedule, it could even be by a little, can be fun. Trying new things can be entertaining and can be good for you in many ways. Another way activities can be fun is you are able to make new friends who have the same interests as you and enjoy certain things you enjoy as well. Making new friends can impact you in many ways such as impacting who you are. Lastly,having fun before you enter adulthood is very important since you might not be able to do all these activities when you grow up. Have all the fun you can as a kid before it all gets taken away from you. Having fun is one of the many benefits about joining an activity at your school.\nHowever, some people don't think students should join an extra curricular activity. Some people may think this because students already have to do so much at home and they are already so busy. This is wrong because students should be able to learn and have life skills for their future. Having time management is something every student should be able to do before entering adulthood and why not practice now? When we become adults we are going to have a lot of work on our hands and we aren't going to know how to manage all the work since we didn't have an previous experiences similar to this in school. Life skills are one of the most important skills there are.\nStudents should participate in at least one curricular activity. Learning something new about yourself,entertaining yourself,and learning skills for the future are all benefits of joining an activity at school. Go find you hidden talent and enjoy your childhood!

        "There is an unfortunate lack of participation in extracurricular activities at our school. Moreover, the effects of vaping, gangs, depression, and procrastination have taken a toll on the student body. Seldom do I encounter a student who has not experienced some of the aforementioned issues. Therefore, I agree with this decision because extracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made, students to focus more on school, and prevent students from engaging in illegal activities.\nExtracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made. It is no secret that children are social creatures, and they require constant interaction with one another. If there were to be mandatory extracurricular activities, their need to interact will be fulfilled. Students engaged in an extracurricular activity will likely find more friends they can connect with, as another student taking part in the same activity may have similar interests as them. This will be different from a classroom environment, in which there may be students who do not share the same interests and thus unable to befriend each other. Without a doubt, extracurricular activities will be able to satisfy a child's need for social interaction and making friends.\nIn addition to helping students make friends, extracurricular activities can assist students with staying focused on school. These activities may provide ample opportunities for classmates to meet up and discuss homework. They also would encourage students to complete their homework once the activity is over. Extracurricular activities keep students in a productive environment, further their work ethic, dissuade them from returning home to do nothing but stare at their phones for hours at a time, and encourage them to finish homework. When a student eventually moves on to become an adult with a job and a family, they can use the experience they had gained while working with others in an extracurricular activity to help them become a functioning member of society. Certainly, extracurricular activities are instrumental in helping a student grow into an studious man or woman.\nExtracurricular activities prevent students from engaging in illegal activities. Gangs have made a resurgence in the school district lately, and students are partaking in crimes such as dealing drugs and vandalism. Furthermore, the teen vaping epidemic has severely impacted our school in particular. These illegal activities are fueled by depression, isolation, and bad grades. All of these issues can be rectified by implementing mandatory extracurricular activities. As mentioned above, extracurricular activities can provide students with ways to socialize and improve their academic situations. A troubled student may not be able to find time to meet with a gang or purchase a vaping device when they are involved in an extracurricular activity. Without any reason or time to break the law, order may be restored in the school and the consequences of gang violence and vaping may be avoided. Then, the troubled student can academically succeed and grow up to be a law abiding citizen.\nI support the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of their ability to form new friendships between students, make students focus more on academics, and eliminate the possibility of students consistently breaking the law. After this rule is implemented, the school, no doubt, will become a much friendlier and productive place for students.Â Â Â",

So one day I decided to stay after for a french extracurricular that I ended up really enjoying, so I started to go every day that it was offered, I started realized how much of an impact it made on my grade I went from having a C to an A. This is one of the many impacts an educational extracurricular activity can have of your students.\nHave you ever been really interested in a sport but not knowing how to play it?\nIf you think about it, Labron James was not always as amazing of a basketball player as he is now. The reason he is so good is because of how much time, effort and motivation he put into his practices. Staying after for a sport can put you on your path to being able to succeed to doing well at the sport. That is why it is so important to have after school sport extracurricular activities to help students who have a dream of playing the sport professionally accomplish it.\nStudents who feel more stressed out from school or home are less likely to do as well in school as others. Students who have parents who make them do homework as soon as they get home without a break feel more stressed, and probably wont put in as much effort as they would is they got a break. At my school they provide us with after school downtime clubs to help students relive their mind. It also helps students get the break that is needed form a hard working day at school, and students are more likely to have better grade outcomes.\nThis is why is it good for students to be required to do at least on extracurricular activity after school. They will help students do better in school, help students who are interested in playing any sports get better, and will help students who are stressed from school feel more relived. So next time you doubt what amazing powers of extracurricular activities remember how much of great of an effect it can have on students.Â Â Â',

I think if the principal did this then he would get complaints from the parents of the kids of them not getting the activity they wanted.\nOne reason I disagree is because, you shouldn't be forced to take anything you don't want to take. Say you chose soccer but they didn't have any room left for you so they moved you into basketball, and you really dislike basketball, How would you feel? Families may not have enough money to buy you equipment for these activities. Finally, I think it should be a choice for students to see if they want to take any of the classes, they shouldn't be forced to take one.\n.\n.\n.",

        "Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity so they can make friends and do what the like without being forced. It also can help students get out of there shy zone and do something they like or enjoy, and just be themselves. I agree that all students should have to participate in at least one activity like the yearbook, helping teachers, and sports.\nOne activity they could do is help teachers with students. When a teacher is teaching and some students are having a hard time understanding the lesson they can help there class mates, since it's only one teacher and about twenty students. The teacher can't help everybody at one time so one student can be their little helper. So if one student understand the lesson then they can help the teacher with the other students. Also they can help grade papers with the teacher. So the students can get there paper back faster and see if they were successful or if they need more practice and studying time. So like if they got a 60% on there test then they know they can stay after school and get extra help so they can pass next time. One more thing is students are scared to ask questions because they think people will mess with them for getting help, so they just stay quiet and not get the help they need.\nAnother activity they could participate in is the yearbook club. The yearbook is like an important thing in school because it holds all the amazing memories that happen throughout the school year. What makes it fun is the students can go all around the school and take pictures. Also they can decorate the book and make is enjoyable for others. When students are participating in the yearbook it means they can make new friends and be be more active. If the students get caught in school taking pictures all the time, then ask them if they want to be apart of the yearbook club and they can take pictures all they want and not get in trouble. The yearbook club should be a place the students can be free, have fun, and not have to have a teacher yelling at them all the time for something small.\nOne final thing student's can participate in is sports. Some students love sports but scared to try out because they think their not good enough for the team, so they just sitÂ back and stay quiet or d nothing. If sports is something students' like to do then they should do it if it's basketball. football, soccer, or anything else then do it. Students have the right to do what they want without having to be asked or blackmailed. Like if a student is in GYM class and not doing anything then out of nowhere the coach says \"\"if you don't participate in the game then i'm calling your parents\"\". So let the students choose when they are going to join in a game. If some students want to play soccer but the others want to play basketball, then have one side of the court basketball and the other soccer. So they all can do what they like and have fun.\nI agree that student's should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as the yearbook club, helping the teacher, and sports. So the students can feel free at those times and have fun doing what makes them happy. Â Â Â",

        "The principal has stated that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity can be best defined as an activity that does not have to do with main school subjects, these can be sports, clubs, etc. Having an extracurricular activity can be very beneficial to students and teachers alike. People can join clubs, sports, or student committees which can help the school run smoothly and possibly even get it awards, if the teams do well. It can help the teachers refine the way they teach and help the students learn in an improved way. Finally, this can help the students in many ways, such as giving them more social skills, getting help in a subject they need help in, helping to find a new skill, or helping to nurse and grow a current skill.\nThe first way that having extracurricular activities is helpful and beneficial to students is the fact that these can help grow social skills. Many people in school don't really talk to others, they mainly stay either focused on their studies or on their personal problems, this leaves them open to bullying or, worse even mental health problems such as depression. This is because they feel that no one gets them and that they are all alone in school, being in a club, however, could let them talk to other people and spill their feelings about problems. Even if they feel that their problems are their own business, they could talk about things that they do in their free time, what games they play, hobbies, or views on certain subjects. Even if people don't have problems, they could be solely focused on learning and not talking to people, because they may feel that this is just a mere distraction from what is truly important. However, these people need to talk to people so that they don't develop depression or worse mental illnesses, which is where a club or social group could help.\nAnother way that this can be beneficial is in the field of academics. Many people in school are very talented, but they just don't understand a certain subject or problem, and teachers have many other students to worry about, so they may end up missing them. This could make the struggling student feel resentful, and start making them feel that the teacher doesn't care and that they should just give up, since there is no one to help, especially if their parents are too busy or if they don't seem to care. If they were to join a study club, things could change, someone else in the club could step up and help, better yet a teacher could help the student and they could help solve the problem and possibly even change the way they teach to help more students understand a particularly difficult topic. Going to this study club could also help people who are more focused on studies talk to other people or teach them, because it's said that you don't truly know something until you teach it, so this could be a learning experience for both sides.\nThe final way that this program can benefit the school would be it could let students find new athletic skills. More and more people now have started to just sit around and play video games or look at social media, this means that there is a higher risk of obesity in younger generations, it also means that they aren't getting enough sunlight to keep their bodies healthy. Despite many people thinking that saying this is just an excuse to get them outside, sunlight actually gives us the vitamin D we need to survive, so joining a sports team or even a hiking club can let people become more fit and healthy, and it could let them talk to people face to face, instead of over a chat, which will make them know that this is a real person, and someone their age who can be interested in the same things as them. For someone who wants to try out for something, but doesn't know if they have the skill, they could join a small club and practice for a sport to grow their skills. This could also let a person learn something new about themselves, such as finding a new ability that they didn't know they had, which could inspire self confidence in them. Along with that, this could lead to an influx of talented people which could help the sports teams out and potentially even lead them to championshipsÂ which would give the school large amounts of recognition.\nAs stated in the above three points, the principal's new plan is a very good idea that can be beneficial for all parties involved. Having at least one extracurricular activity lets students be fit and healthy, and it could also let themÂ socialize, build confidence, and work on schoolwork at the same time. Along with that, it could allow students who are already knowledgeable about something test how much they really understand it. This could also let teachers refine the ways they teach their subjects and also identity who might need more help than others which could let them do their job in a much better way. This project could help the school because if the students are getting higher scores and the teachers are doing a better job at teaching, then it could get the school more recognition. All of these would ultimately lead to a school that is vastly superior to others.",

        "Have you ever been forced to do something you might not always want to by a parent or a teacher, such as an after school activity? Many students are pressured to sign up for sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities by parents, friends, and teachers. This ensures that they are getting physical activity, time off electronics, and are spending time with their community. However, students should not be forced to participate in these extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ because of their homework and jobs, lack of time spent with their families and friends, and the money some families do not have to pay for these activities.\nStudents' lives are almost always busy, and many rarely have a chance to relax. First, they have to spend eight hours of their day in school, only to go home and do two hours of homework. After that homework, many students go work jobs to save for college or build a resume. Even after that job has ended, students go home and may have to help do chores around the house. Only after those fourteen hours of the day have flown by is the student allowed to finally get ready for bed, struggle to get their required eight hours of sleep, and wake up only to do it all again. With this crowded schedule, it would be near impossible to manage an after school activity that lasts about two hours on top of all that. Kids should be able to enjoy their childhood by hanging out with their friends and relaxing, not having to worry about how the yearbook is coming along, if the sports teams are doing well this season, and if the school has the budget for prom at the end of the year. Those are enrichment activities that people without as busy lives should be able to choose to partake in, not forced to.\nPeople hear a lot that they should strive to spend quality time with their friends and family, to ensure they don't become a little hermit that lives in a secluded world of their own. On top of the already insane schedule many students maintain, there's very little time left for spending time with friends and loved ones. Many students miss out on going to the mall on weekends with their friends, going out on dates with their significant other, and laughing at movies with their parents and siblings because they're busy working, applying to colleges, or doing homework that a teacher assigned to them over the weekend. Forcing them to participate in extracurricularÂ activities does not benefit the situation at all. On top of not being able to spend time with the people that mean most to them, they're being told to run laps at sports practices, waking up at dawn to get ready for the big game, taking pictures for the yearbook at events, or going to meetings with the other student government members to plan the school dance. This causes immense stress for students, and it also weakens the bonds and strains the relationships between students and their friends and family.\nIt's not exactly difficult to see the fact that many students' families struggle financially. Many times, the only time students ever get to eat is at school, and often don't have enough money for hygiene, clothes, or school supplies. If these students are forced to participate in these after school activities, they may not be able to afford it; if they can, it often becomes even more of a struggle for the family, as that money could have been spent on paying the bills or food, rather than it being spent on sports uniforms and gas for cars that need to be driven to and back from practices, meetings, and events. Sports tend to be very expensive, with registration fees, uniforms, proper equipment, gas to drive the students places, and snacks to provide after school, as many students need to eat during practices. ninety percent of Americans are already in some sort of debt, whether it's student loans, house mortgage, cars, or just bad spending. Adding the cost of sports or other after school activities will drown students and their families in bills that they may not be able to pay off.\nAlthough it is a good idea for students to participate in extracurricular activities, they should never be forced to because it impacts many students negatively because of their busy schedules, lack of time with their friends and loved ones, and because of the financial struggles many students' families face and may not be able to afford. Instead, students should be able to say whether they can and want to participate in these activities, or be able to not do extracurricular activitiesÂ and be able to relax and spend their leisure time however they please.",

This means students can take extra or another class other than your, Civics, Science, English, or Math. Some classes can be yearbook crew, photography crew or maybe a computer crew! Anything is a good choice.\nBeing in a extracurricular class can help you learn something new. When being in a extracurricular class means you learn something different than your usual subjects.\nYou can have chance to learn your favorite subject example;Art. Extracurricular classes makes you open your mind to other things or be open mined. When you want a job on the class you are taking, it can help you have a better understanding if what that subject or job, is going to be about. People still take their usual classes, but they might need more help. So they take a extra class to help them get better at the subject they are struggling with.\nWhen is a extracurricular class or activity you can be more social or make more friends. When in extra activity class you are most likely be in a group of people. Being in a group with a lot of people can make you more social and have a voice. Communication is key, so when you are in a group you can be better at communication. When being social you meet someone that you feel more comfortable talking to. For example, when you are in a class that you or, a student doesn'tÂ feel comfortable talking in you can talk to the teacher cause maybe, they are the only person in the room you are comfortable talking with.\nIn some certain classes you can go traveling or go on a trip. For example, if you are taking a music class than, you can choose to go on the trip. This also helps you getting out of the house more. Some students love to travel sometimes it helps them learn new thing on a subject. When travelingÂ in a school trip you probably wont have your parents there with you, cause they might have work. So when you go on a trip by yourself, it teaches you how to take care of yourself and how to be more dependent. Some students have bad parents so traveling with your friends and taking a break from your mom or dad can be a good thing for some students. However, some students or parents think its bad for students to go off on their own. Some say that it can be dangerous and that something might happen to their child.\nBeing in a extracurricular activity isn't always a bad thing. It can maybe get you into a good job in the future.

        "Should students be required to attend extracurricular activities? Would this really help students and provide enjoyable experiences? While there are some good things that could come out of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities, there are some downsides as well. Personally, I disagree with the decision to require all students to participate in the activities because some students may not enjoy doing extracurricular activities, or simply might not have any time to attend them. Extracurricular activities do give some students the opportunity to expand their knowledge in certain areas, spend time with friends, and maybe help them find their passion in life, but other students may not be as positively impacted in the same way as others.\nSo, there are the students who don't enjoy participating in extracurricular activities. There are many students who don't prefer to do these activities because perhaps they are socially awkward and would rather avoid social interaction. Maybe there just isn't an activity that is available to them that is of interest. Another reason is that they might enjoy doing something else that doesn't qualify as an extracurricular activity. It isn't right that the principal is forcing students to do something they don't want to do. Students should be able to choose what they want to do and how to spend their time. Some may learn how to enjoy an activity after joining one they were unsure about, but others may end up not enjoying the experience at all, therefore, giving them something not to look forward to that was forced upon them with the intention of a positive impact.\nOther students may not like the decision that requires them to attend extracurricular activities, specifically activities held after school hours, because they already have plans, and being forced to attend activities would break in to their already-planned schedules. Scheduled plans such as family events; religious events; sporting events that don't directly involve the student; work hours for a job; or perhaps just time to finish schoolwork. All of these examples are things that students may not feel obligated to cancel, just so they can attend an activity that was forced upon them. There will obviously be some times when students are allowed to miss out on the extracurricular activities they are supposed to attend, but why give students a sense of worry about not being able to go to an event that they might feel very obligated to attend?\nOnce again, I disagree with the decision to force students for participate in extra curricular activities because some may not enjoy doing them, and others may not have time to attend them. The fact is, is that the principal should not be forcing students to attend extracurricular activities. The principal should be giving every student the opportunity to find one and attend one if they wish to, but never have it be mandatory that they do. Many students do enjoy attending extracurricular activities, but it is important to consider the few who don't when making a decision like this.Â",

        "Generic_Name enjoyed going to school so he could socialize with friends and learn about new things. That all changed when his principle decided to make every student required to participate in one or more extracurricular activity. This greatly angered Generic_Name and his parents; many other students felt the same way as he did. None of the activities listed spiked an interest in Generic_Name, but he was forced to participate in one. All the activities took a considerable chunk of time from him which resulted him losing time with his family and friends. Generic_Name thought to himself, \"\"Why do I have to do these extremely boring and useless activities?\"\" Over the course of several weeks, these activities continued and his stress level skyrocketed; his grades started to plummet due to all his stress and he also lost some friends due to his increased irritation due to the activities. He felt like these extracurricular activities have ruined his life. Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because they may not have interest in any of the activities, they may not have the time to participate in any actives and, students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need.\nOne of the more important reasons why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because that they may not be interested in any of the activities. When students are forced to do something they don't enjoy, it makes them frustrated and not willing to work. If students and not interested in an activity, why force them to it as it will interfere with the students that are genuinely interested in the activity? A supporter of required extracurricularÂ activities would say that it allows students to try new things that they may enjoy. However, this is just not the case for most students because students can determine what an activity would be like with the given information. Most people would not want to do something they don't enjoy, so why make the students do it?\nA contributing factor to why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because that students may not have the time to participate in any activities. As more and more students do activities not related to the school, they would not be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Students may also not have time due to them being with family and friends and students should have to be away from family and friends if they don't want to. A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that students would manage their time wisely. That is false due to the fact that students may not be able to change to time for their other activities and they might only to be able to see their family and friends at certain times. If students don't have the time for extracurricular activities, they shouldn't have to participate in them.\nThe most important reason why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need. As students already spend up to seven hours a day in school, they shouldn't have to spend anymore time than they want. What students want to do after school should be up to them, not the school. Forcing students to do something unneededÂ that takes up their precious time is just wrong; Student's time should not be stolen like this. A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that forcing students to participate in these activities would be beneficial them. This is not the case because students would not get a benefit from being forced, it would be the opposite. Students shouldn't be forced to do something, they should have the option to do something, but not be forced.\nThough extracurricular activities may be beneficial to some, it is not for all students. Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because they may not have interest in any of the activities, they may not have the time to participate in any actives and, students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need. If students were forced to do extracurricular activities, it would be problematic for the students and the school. Students should be able to decide how they want to spend their youth, not the school. If you could change any of my reasons, what would you change?",

Me personally I disagree, but I am going to talk about my opinions on why right now.\nPeople shouldn't have to do anything after schoolÂ if they don't want to. Staying after school is a opportunity to have fun and see some of your friends. Therefore if it was forced it would defiantly not be as much fun because you wouldn't want to do it. Nobody should be forced to do something if they don't want to.\nThere are other things people want or have to do sometimes instead of staying after school everyday. It would take away some of the fun. For instance what if someone wants to go out of town but they can't because they have to stay after school. Additionally people have other things to do outside of school, things like ballet, basketball for someplace else, maybe any sport, etc.. If they did then they would be burned out like a fire in the rain.\nHaving homework and having to stay after everyday would be terrible. With having to stay after school also comes homework. We at least have one thing to do everyday, sometimes more. With that being said some after schoolÂ activities last 2:30-4:00 or 2:30-6:30. Homework usually takes 20 minutes tops depending on what it is, but when you have 2 or 3 things to do you can't go to bed until late. Also studying can be hard with an after schoolÂ activity because that really takes a long time. Additionally, you still have to shower and do things to prepare for the next day which makes you go to bed even later when you have to wake up at 5:30-6:30AM. Only that is whole different subject for a while different time.\nStaying after school is fun but if you were forced it would change everything. People stay after because they want to, not because they are forced too. It would defiantly not be fair if people were forced too. That is my opinion on this question.",

        'Starting at a young age and throughout their life, every child and person wants to be great at something. If you look at the people who are truly great at what they do, they all started their passion at a young age. Many sports players, politicians, and people in all fields are a great example of this. Quite frankly, extracurricularÂ activities are a great way to spur interest within students in their youth. For this reason, I believe that the principal made the right decision about making students do at least one extracurricular activity. Beside for getting students to develop an interest and passion for something at a young age, extracirrular activities also help people become more confident in their abilities. Additionally, with all of these options, there has to be at least one activity for each student to have an interest in.\nAs I stated earlier, extracurricular activities are a great way to get students to find a new interest. For all you know, the student may really like the activity and pursue it as a profession. Without being required to do the activity, the student may not have even discovered their interest in whatever the activity is. Requiring students to do extracurricular is a great way to open new door and possibilities for the student. There are many different activities the student can take, so at least one has to be appealing. By finding out what they have an interest in, and starting at a young age, the student will have plenty of time to develop the skills need at get really good at something. It is important to be unique in at least one thing, because it helps identify who you are as a person. Even if the student does not ""fall in love"" with their activity, it still could not hurt to try something new.\nStaying on the topic of learning something new, extracirrular activities are a great way to get students out of their comfort zone and to build up self-confidence. If the school did not require the student to take an extracurricular activity, chances are that the student would not have tried out something new. By making students try something new or continue something that they are already good at, it is making them better at whatever they are doing. This boosts their confidence level, and makes them want to try even more new things. Additionally, many of these clubs and activities include working with other people and students. This means that these clubs help students with their communication, organization, and teamwork skills. Personally, I am on my school\'s debate team, and I enjoy not only having fun and tournaments, but also working with my friends that are also on the team. Even though I do not really plan on becoming a lawyer or politician, I still feel as if being on the team has made me a more confident and clear speaker. Helping develop important life skills is once again another benefit of making requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity.\nWhether it is a sport, club, or leadership position, there is always something for each and every student. Based on the field that the person wants to go in, they can do an activity that is related to that field. For example, if the person wanted to be a politician, they could do something relating to the student council. Out of the many choices for extracurricular activities, at least one has to fit each student. Even if the student is not sure what they want to be, there are also plenty of options such as sports that are plenty of fun!\nAlthough some people may say that it is not right to force somebody into doing an activity, or say that there are better things the person can do with that time, the whole purpose of requiring students to do after schoolÂ activities is so they can get better. Not only do extracurricularÂ actitivites help give students important life skills, but they also give students a chance to gain an interest and passion in an activity. If anything, it just giving the students another opportunity to try out something new. It is almost guaranteed that every student will find something that they can manage, so there is no downsides of requiring students to do extracurricularÂ activities.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it is best for people start something at a young age, and requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a great way to do that.Â',

Our principal should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will encourage students to make friends and develop new skills.\nRequiring students to participate in extracurricular activities gives them the opportunity to make new friends.Â Anyone who has been a part of a team or club knows that when someone is a part of a group, they form friendships that can last. Additionally, students who were always too afraid to be themselves at school would have a second chance at doing so by buiding confidence.Â Having friends is important because friends can make a person happier overall and give them a sense of belonging. Making friends outside of school will also earn them more friends in school. Soon, the empty nearby seats at the lunch table will be occupied with people that a student met at one of their extracurricular activities.Â Some people may not be very social at school, but participating in an activity outside of school will give them the chance to speak up and form strong friendships.\nWhether a student is interested in doing sports, cooking, or participating in an academic competition for their extracurricular activity, they will develop several important skills along the way.Â The most obvious skill they will develop: being able to do that particular activity. However, students will also develop leadership skills, collaboration skills, and many other skills that can be applied to tasks and activities that they will do in the future. For example, one extracurricular activity that I participate in is dance. Dance has taught me how to work well in a team because I have to work with the other girls in my group to create unified movements. Dance has also taught me leadership skills and teaching skills because I often teach dance classes for the students at a lower level. I have the responsibility of deciding what they need to accomplish that day, and then executing it. Like dance, extracurricular activities can teach students important skills, that will benefit them in school and in the future.\nIn the end, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will only benefit them by giving them the opportunity to make new friends and develop important skills.Â If someone is marked as the ""shy kid"" at school and doesn\'t have friends, participating in an extracurricular activity will build their confidence to speak up and make friends. Extracurricular activities can also teach students important life lessons and give them skills that will improve their work and relations in school and in the future.Â All in all, requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a decision that at first glance seems terrible because it takes away the students\' freedom, but in reality, it will have many positive effects on their lives.',

      essay:
        "Do you think that every student should have to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity? Well, in my opinion I don't think that students should have to be forced into that. Doing that could cause a lot of stress on many of people.Â That being said, the parents of those students would then have to worry extra about any activity their children is participating in. Now, think about all the trouble the kids that are disrespectful would cause. That would mean more trouble-making kids to deal with all the time. I disagree with this decision because not all students have the extra time, permission from their parents, or they might even abuse this privilege.\nFirst off, have you ever thought about how much spare time another person has on a day-to-day basis? Many students have a set routine that gives them a plan of what they do everyday. Whether or not that includes chores, time with their family, or even a job that gets them some money. Putting that responsibility on the kids and parents will cause a lot of chaos. This would mean working parents struggling to find a ride for their kid, or even the kids who might already struggle with time management with the stuff they have to do everyday.\nNow think back, has anybody, even your parents, ever told you no, that you can't do something?\nAll children face this answer everyday; It may be about going to their friends house, or asking to stay home from school. Just imagine a pair of very busy parents, or even a single parent, having their kid ask if they can participate in a extracurricular activity. Their first thought could be, \"\"This is going to affect my work schedule and I can't loose anymore money.\"\" If they get told no by their parents, while this rule is enforced, it may cause them to get in trouble by their principle or teacher.\nLastly, have you ever hosted or attendedÂ an event thatÂ a lot of people showed up at? If so, you know there are some people who don't care about anyone else and will cause trouble wherever they go and whenever they want. If that were to happen at a school, and the children who see it go home and tell their parents, the school would get a lot of complaints. After a certain amount of complaints the school would start to be questioned by higher authorities and they may even be looked down upon. Some students will get that type of opportunity and abuse it. They will cause as much mischief and chaos as they can. They may cause fights, be disrespectful to their mentor, or even damage school property.\nIf you haven't already realized how this decision could affect a school, then hopefully you understand it now. There may be a handful of students that care about participating in school activities or sports. But not every student is that way. Making all the students at a school participate in a extracurricular activity could cause a lot of problems, with the students or parents. This decision would be a big problem because some students may not have the time, they may cause a lot of trouble and are disrespectful, or they may have parents who are too busy for any extra activities.Â",

        "Have you ever participated in an extracurricular activity before?\nWho or what made you participate or join that extracurricular activity and benefit from it? Many schools convince or make students participate in extracurricular activities such as sports, working on the year book,or serving on the student council to make them active in order to prevent them from being idle apart from school basedÂ activities. I agree that our principle should make us participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents.\nThe first reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it keeps us fit and healthy. For instance,take a sport such as basketball. Most basketball players are fit and healthy because basketball serves as a physical activity which makes them be in a very good shape for any situation. Playing basketball can also make people healthy by burning fat from their bodies and preventing their blood vessels from being clogged. Being fit and healthy means a lot to the school ,and that is why the principle should make us participate in extracurricular activities\nThe second reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it can improve our brain function. Apart from school activities, students can also acquire more knowledge to improve their brain function by participating in extracurricular activities. I once read an article on a website named \"\"Gale.\"\" It stated that scientists have proven that students that have participated extracurricular activities in schools have improved brain function and has made them more attentive, more quite and more discipline ,but I didn't believe that until my friend from another school,which has extracurricular activities,told me he joined the student's council. At first, I told him it wasn't going to do him any but in a few weeks, I noticed changes about my friend. He had become much more brilliant and more knowledgeable. He told me it was because he joined the students council and it improved the ability of his brain to think and to act some ways. So improved brain functions of students is one thing we would benefit from if our school was introduced to extracurricular activities.\nThe final reason\nI agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is thatÂ it can help students find their unknown talents. An example I would like to share is that my elder sister was in high school ,and she participated in the extracurricular activities. At first, she didn't want to participate in it ,but my mom edged her to do it becauseÂ she saw her juggling her ball ,and my mom saw that she was very good at soccer. She could have made her join a youth team for soccer ,but she didn't have enough money. When my sister joined, she didn't perform well at all ,but when the coach motivated her, she showed her through colors. She led the school's women soccer team to win the district finals and the state finals. People always asked her where she had acquired these skills for soccer ,but she had only one answer,\"\" I didn't discover my talent until I joined my school's extracurricular activity.\"\" She is now a big superstar play in Europe for a club named Arsenal. So many talents can be revealed if the principle could make everyone participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\nIn conclusion, I agree that the principle should make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents although one might disagree with my decision.",

        "Imagine the sound of the school bell ringing, freedom, time to go home, it is a Friday after all, you get to go home and relax; but then you remember the new rule, all students must be signed up for an extra curricular activity. There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other prioritiesÂ whether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.\nThere is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they dont have enough time already and if forced to join a club that only meets once a week for an hour that just cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sports that are very time consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time consuming part of every child'sÂ life is family, spending time with grand parents or even just having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.\nA huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.\nTo close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club dont want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it just makes everything worse. Also there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.\nKids shouldnt be required to be in an extra curricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many different things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.",

        "Some people agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities instead of letting the students stay home and do what they want to. This is wrong and cause many problems. I disagree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments.\nThe first point is that students may not have time for these activities. For instance, students could be participating in other events that are not provided by the school. If students tried to participate in both activities, one could get in the way of another and cause issues. Students may also miss the activities because they are spending time with their families. If they were forced to go to these activities, they could loose the time they would be spending with their family by participating in the activities. Another problem that could occur is the parents not having the time to take their children their activities. This could be cause by work or any other event that the parents must attend.\nThe next point is that students may not be interested in the activities that their school provides. This could be because the school may not have many activities. If the school does not have many activities, some students will be left out and forced to choose one that they do not want to participate in. Another reason could be that the school does not have the money for specific activities. For example, a student may want to participate in wrestling, but the school cannot provide the needed gear and mats. This would mean that the student cannot participate in an activity that they would like to participate in.\nThe final point is that students may not be able to complete assignments. If a student has a very important test that they must take, they have to study for it. If the student cannot study for tests, they may get a poor grade. Students may also have projects or homework that must be completed. If they do not complete these things, the student's grade could fall and they would have to work harder to raise it. If they still did not have the time to work extra because of the required activity, they could suffer from an even poorer grade.\nIn conclusion, students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments. If students are required to participate in these activities, many problems could arise. Â",

The principles decision to make extracurricular activities mandatory is incredible. After all, extracurricular activities are a great way to make new friends, learning new things, and give you an opportunity to help the school out.\nThe first reason that mandatory extracurricularÂ activities are beneficial, is you can make lots of new friends. In clubs you are surrounded by people with the same interests as you. This gives you an opportunity to share things with other people, connect, and work together. Whether it's on a sports team, or in the year book club you interact with new people and make some new friends. So get out of the house and make some new friends by joining an extracurricular club!\nThe second reason that they are beneficial, is think about all the new things you can learn, by joining extracurricular activities you learn new things through social interactions, or improve on pre-existing skills.

By not joining you are wasting the opportunity to learn and more importantly have some fun!\nFinally, one day you can put some of these clubs on your resume. It might sound crazy but it's true. If you are trying to get a job relating to coding, and you took the coding club as a kid, you can slap that on to your resume! That could be the difference between you getting the job and another person getting a job. You never know! My dad told me that he still remember some of the things he learned in a coding club and still applies that knowledge today. These clubs are free knowledge so take advantage!\nIn conclusion having mandatory extracurricular activities is beneficial because it gives you many social opportunities, you can learn many new and exciting things from these extracurricular activities, and these extracurricular activities can be used throughout life. If you school does not make this mandatory, you should join a club anyways. But choose wisely!",

        'Isolation. Nothing to do. That\'s what most kids do when they get home. Play video games or sit on their phones for hours. That\'s why schools should have students participate in one extracurricular activity. This could help make students happier and healthier, improve social skills, and give opportunities to explore their interest.\nOne reason schools should have students participate in one activity is because it makes students healthier and happier. Studies from John Hopkins university stated that ""9 out of 10 kids are happier when they participate in activities."" Which means more students are in a better mood because they\'re moving around and getting exercise. Getting kids to go outside can improve their mood swings. Not only does it help with mood swings, it also helps with depression. Healthier and happier students tend to be more happier in general\nAnother reason kids should have extracurricular activities is because it improves social skills. Professor Jimmy Facs, from University of New York, says, ""kids who get involved in out of school activities, have better social skills than kids that do not participate in anything. Also, getting involved in out of school activitiesÂ help kids with anxiety."" Facs basically is saying that out of school activities helps kids get out of their comfort zone. Pre-teens who have anxiety could feel more safe around the people at their school. Kids that participate in extracurricular activities could also meet new friends that they\'ve never talked to or even see before. Meeting new people could form a better community at this school.\nAnother important reason is that extracurricular activities could open up new opportunities or interest for students. A survey from students at Generic_School shows that 3 out of 4 students find a new hobby or interest that they enjoy. This means that kids could try something they\'ve never tried before. Finding more interests for students could help them open up their choices of what they want to become when they grow up. This could also help students find people who have the same interest.\nSome parents and students complain that they won\'t have time for homework. In an article produced by the Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City says, ""kids that participate in multiple sports still come home to homework. This could make the student stress and have a mental breakdown."" The Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City is stating that kids mental health is bad because they have multiple activities going on. Although some students say they get stressed from more extracurricular activities, most kids already participate in one. In an article by Generic_Name, she states, ""5 out students 6 say they already participate in sports. A student from Generic_School, Generic_Name, even says, \'I play 4 sports and I have never been stressed. Playing 4 sports actually makes me feel less stressed.\'"" Generic_Name is saying that most kids play sports to relax them. Relaxation makes students feel more focused in school. Putting all your anger into playing a sport can make students more calm when it comes to challenges. Less stress can help students loosen up.\nOverall, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It helps students be healthier and happier, improves their social skills, and opens up more opportunities. Activities benefits both you and your community. Your community can do is support sports by, going to a game. What you can do is, participate in an activity you\'ve never tried before. Open up more opportunities for yourself. See what\'s out there, you\'ll never know until you try.',

It has been proven that most children show an increase in brain activity, creativity, and over all functionality when they have been and/or are currently doing an extracurricular activity. This includes sports such as football, basketball, baseball, soccer and many more outdoor activities that encourage physical health. These activities also include board games like scrabble, chess, and puzzles that help with brainÂ growth, comprehension and critical thinking skills.\nExtracurricular activities are always something someone should at leastÂ think about indulging one's self in. In any case an extracurricular activity could help you with a lot of obstacles in life; such as social struggles like making friends or speaking up in class or maybe less expressive things like focus and paying attention. These activities also help with confidence, self esteem and to a certain extent humility. Most extracurricular's teach teamwork and cooperation and in many cases how to make friends and conflict resolution. This usually resolves in great social and communication skills.\nAfter school activities and extracurricular activities in addition don't just help with mental and/or physical health, but they also do a lot for one's future as well. An extracurricular activity in the future could be used as a credit for a job or college regime; even allow a person to earn a scholarship for the activity that they have chosen to participate and even excelÂ in. Although most esteemed colleges do offer scholarships for physical sports, others often give scholarships for more academicÂ extracurricular's such as debate, mathematics and common knowledge quizzers. This is a great reason to motivate one to take on an extracurricular and better one's self.\nExtracurricular activities have become very important in the modern world. This because of the over usage of cellularÂ devices, most people don't talk face to face or even go outside at all. It is important that people indulge in extracurricular activities so that they can create a face to face sense of understanding and friendship in an environment where everything is digital. The needÂ for extracurricular activities is dire and has to comeback before the value of friendship is lost. Extracurricular activities maybe one of the most important things in this day and age.",

      essay:
        "I agree with the principal that students should engage in some type of activity outside of school and their current form of education. If students were to do so, then they could meet others who share the same interests, which would benefit all students because they are doing things that they like to do, and at the same time, they are sharing the experience with others who enjoy doing the same activity. Extracurricular activities can help students to find and learn about a skill, whether it's one they've never tried before or one they havent had time to look into yet. In addition, extracurricular activities can help students later on in life when they are in college, applying for a job, or any point in their lives beyond that. The principal has chosen to require students to attend an extracurricular activity, which is not only beneficial to them in many ways, but also to everyone elseÂ when the students go out into the world and spread their gifts and talents.\nOne way that students could be helped by learning an extracurricular activity is that they can meet some new people that they might not have ever met before. Students can become friends with them since they have a bond over the activity that they are both interested in. However, some students are shy and/or have fears of social interactions, which can cause them to avoid these activities, but extracurricular activities can actually help get those timid and quiet students to express themselves through the activity. Sometimes, these students are alone and have no friends, which can lead to them feeling down, as well as anxious; extracurricular activities can help prevent these students from being isolated, and can also help them to relax by eleviating the anxiety that they might feel when they are alone. If students become more extroverted in this manner, then they will feel good about doing an activity that they want to do, which can possibly make them feel better so they are happier and less pessimistic.\nThe additional requirement of an extracurricular activity is opposed by some students who say that it wastes their time and interferes with their schedule that is always packed. Having a packed schedule is not always a good idea because it could physically and mentally stress the human body; a way to vent this stress is through an extracurricular activity where students can focus on what they're passionate about instead of what stresses them. Other students who disagree say that they don't know what type of activity they want to participate in; thanks to the wide variety of choices available, they will most likely find either an activity that matches their interests or one that helps them to learn something new. Another pro is that they can choose an activity such as Homework Club that assists them in getting their work done so they don't have as much to do. If students really enjoy an activity, they may choose to major in that activity in college, consider it as a job, or at least find it useful sometime later in life, which disproves the argument that extracurricular activities won't ever help anyone.\nSome students don't have access to certain materials and items at home and are barely getting by because minorities often get less money than the majority does, which can unfairly deny them the chance to do the activities that they like doing; extracurricular activities are usually held at and/or sponsored by schools that receiveÂ enough money, which gives these underprivileged students a chance to finally participate in extracurricular activities. These minorities are often lonely and neglected, so a mandatory extracurricular activity will help them to feel included in a larger group.\nIn conclusion, I truly believe that it is necessary to add an extracurricular activity to the school curriculum because it can lead to so many good results. Requiring them will lead to students feeling less alone and stressed, as well as finding ways to help reduce that stress and include all students. It will help minority groups to be able to engage in activities that they have previously been unjustly impeded from doing. It will also allow students to find others who are passionate about similar things, which might lead to them becoming friends.Â Lastly, it will help to prepare students for their future, even if the activity they like to do doesn't seem that useful. For these reasons, I agree with the principal's decision to make an extracurricular activity mandatory.",

      essay:
        "The principal can decide a lot of things, but not decide what a student does before or after school. I disagree with the principal's idea of making all students do one extracurricular activity. First issue is, it extends an already drawn out school day, making the day last an extra hour or two. Also, a student's talent may not represented in a club, therefore making them feel left out. Finally, students may have outside of school routines, or work they must do, and this rule interferes with their routine. This idea is taking away a bit more of a student's free will, thus leading to my argument. I disagree with the idea of making all students participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because it extends an already long school day, could make students feel left out because their talent isn't represented, and can interfere with a students after schoolÂ or before school routine. Now, onto a more in-depth look.\nFirst of all, the school day issue. School can already be long and tiring, so there's no need to make it longer for students. While some may enjoy sports or other extracurricular activities, those who do not are wasting their time by doing an activity they may not enjoy. Students typically only have around 5 hours of free time outside of school. Add an extra two hours and now they have 3 hours, and some of that time will be used to do homework leaving little time to do what they enjoy. This can stress students out and lead to depression, and make them dread going to school because the entire day is eaten up by it. Along with these points, a student may not have a club or activity they fit into, leading me to my second point.\nNext up, students may not have their talents represented in clubs or activities. Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something.\nFinally, it may interfere with a student's before or after school routine. In the morning, most students have a routine they follow. If they have an activity that begins 45 minutes before school, they have to rearrange their whole schedule. This can lead to them losing sleep, not getting a good enough breakfast, and generally under preparedÂ for school. If a student has an after school activity, this can change and shorten their routine. If they get home, do homework, play games for 2 hours, eat dinner, shower, and then go to sleep, an activity can limit these things to less games or enjoyable activities, not as much of a dinner, and the day being taken up by mostly homework. It can cancel their time to relax or have fun, and cause a routine change. It shouldn't be up to the school to choose a students after or before school life, and throw off their entire schedule.\nTo summarize, I disagree with the principal's idea. It lengthens out a long school day, can make students feel left out, and can mess with a student's schedule. It doesn't seem fair for the school to control a student's out of school time. While school is important, it shouldn't be a student's entire life, they need breaks from it. Clubs, activities, and sports are balanced because people who want to be in them join them, not because they have to. Other people can suffer from a student not participating in their activity making it not enjoyable for others. The school shouldn't choose a student's out of school life.",
