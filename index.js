      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. In other words, teachers believe students should continue learning after the school year ends.Â Some might argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed so the student will have the ability to learn over the summer.Â Summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time, it will allow less stress for the student, and they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time.Â For example, the student will be able to catch up on sleep or exercise.Â Students would be able to relax a little more and enjoy their summer off.Â Students will feel more energized and healthy.Â Students will feel better about themselves. Students will feel more relaxed instead of stressed. Students will feel more calm.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because it will allow for less stress for the student. For example, the student will feel more calm and the assignment will not be as hard for the student. The student will be able to concentrate more. The student will most likely complete the assignment as this will lead to less procrastination.Â They can work with a friend or group. This could lead to the student not having as much stress as they will be working with a friend. This could help relieve stress.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project. For example, the student could decide if they want to work alone or with a friend or group of friends. This may allow the student to have more communications with their friends. This will help the student complete their assignment at hand. This could help students think about what they wanna present for their project when they return to school. This allows the student to make their own desicions. This will help them learn to be independent.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time, it will allow for less stress for the student, and they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project. Some might argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed because this could help the student learn. If the summer projects are teacher-designed, then the student will not have any free time. Overall, this will give the student a lot of free time.",

      "Letting teachers design the project is the most ignorant design ever. Most students would hate to do a teacher design project. The projects should definitely be student design. I strongly believe a summer project is an intelligent way of letting students retain the information. However it should be student design because they'd be more likely to do it, they'd understand the project more, and it gives them responsibility.\n \n Firstly, students would be more likely to participate in a student-designed project. A whole of of students won't be pleased doing a summer project, so the least schools could do is let the students design the project. Also some teachers make projects way too boring. So if the students design the project it'd probably be less boring for them. It'd be much better to let the students could be as creative as they want. When people find something boring they won't do it, especially young people. So letting the students design the project would increase the chances of the student passing the project.\n \n Secondly, the students would understand the project more. Some teachers make extremely confusing rubrics for the project. When teachers make confusing rubrics it causes a negative reaction to the students trying to complete the project. Some students would lose confidence in themselves on the project, which will increase their chances of failing. That would be a horrible startÂ to the new school year. The goal is for students to pass not fail, and teacher design projects would really increase failing chances. Students will have a hard time passing something they don't understand, because like I said earlier; some teachers make really confusing project-designs.\n \n Lastly, is it gives the students more responsibility. Responsibility is one of the most important things a young person can learn. It helps with maturity & being a better adult. So the student would be responsible for the project & designing it. I know it's very little responsibility, however it does help.\n \n Projects should definitely be student designed. Student design projects teaches students more responsibility. Also it would make students more likely to complete the project. If schools do make summer projects, I hope that they are student designed.Â",

      "Some schools implement a summer project to continue the flow of learning, and to ensure that the students' brains retain learned information. When asked to take a position on whether students or teachers should design these projects, I chose both sides. The reasoning behind my decision was quite simple: one side is more knowledgeable when it comes to the information, and has years of experience in teaching on their side. However, nobody knows the experience of living as the secondary group more than they themselves do, so it makes sense that they would have a part in this idea.\n \n Allow me to begin by playing devil's advocate against my own thinking. One may refute my statements with the simple argument of, \"Well, students don't know how to teach, so why should they have a part in this?\". One may also describe my thinking as ineffective by stating along the lines of, \"Well, nobody knows how to plan exciting experiences better than the ones who have to endure them\". Now, both these arguments are well rooted and difficult to counter, however that in and of itself is what lends them to my cause. The first argument supports the idea that teachers are more experienced, thus more prepared to enact such ideas and projects; the second argument then supports my secondary belief, that the students better know themselves, and can lend more than a simple helping hand in the creation of such activities.\n \n Now that I have finished counter-arguing and rebutting, I can begin my statements. I would like to begin with the teachers. My standing on the subject is that teachers are more experienced and better suited to plan the informational aspects of a summer's project. Why, if a student knew the subject matter well enough to plan such an activity, and knew how to best teach and explain it, then they would be in no need of a project or a teacher! Yes, it is the job of the teacher to... well, teach, and it is the job of the student to learn. However, this does not exclude the student from the planning process all together.\n \n The student is quite important, because they are the target audience. They will know, better than anyone, how to reach out and grab hold of their demographic. The student knows what is fun, boring, enticing, and annoying to them as a whole. While it is true that not all students are made equal, and what is fun to one may be dull to another, a democratic poll can be issued to help even the playing field. Alternatively, multiple projects can be issued out to different types of student, or a simple skeleton plan may be issued, with which the students may piece together their own project. Perhaps all three can be issued as a choice, with students choosing which \"flavor\" of project they would find easiest to follow. Yes, the student is an important piece to project design, with the teacher serving a bigger part in project management. Let the demographic choose their product.\n \n As I finish, allow me to restate my core ideas. The teacher is an important utility in the informational and managerial parts of a summer project; however, the student plays just as important a role in the design and creationalÂ aspects. Both sides are nearly equal in importance, and choosing just one as the end all be all is not dissimilar to how American politics are carried out. Yes, it is important to have a fair balance of both sides, with each person playing to their specific strengths. Too much equality and you have a democracy that will never move forwards. Too much freedom and you have a form of communism in which there is no order to help guide everyone to the correct paths. Yes, a balance is much needed; a balance, mind you, that will never be truly found.\n \n That doesn't mean we shouldn't try, however.",

      "Would you want to waste your summer on useless information, or getting a head start on what you are going to learn next year? Teacher-designed summer projects usually prepare you for what you will be learning. So, why not take that chance and have a head start. Teachers make these assignments for the students benefit. It is always better to be prepared, than to be struggling. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed, because the teacher would relate it to what they are going to learn, they could give the students a challenge and choices, and their topics could be more relevant to society.\n \n Although, teacher-designed summer assignments could be more relevant, student-designed assignments would be more fun. The students know what they are interested in more than teachers do. Students could create and design summer assignments that they would enjoy. Doing something fun and entertaining to the students would make their summer not feel like a waste, even though it is for school. However, it may be more fun than if teachers made the assignment, but it would be a waste of time and effort. Students could make the assignment whatever they want and not have it benefit them in any way.\n \n Having a summer assignment about what you are going to learn could help you prepare for that class. Teachers know what their students will be learning, so they should make summer assignments related to that. The assignment would then prepare them for that class next year, and their summer would not have been a waste after all. This could help many students, because everyone learns at a different pace. Students who need more time than others to comprehend the information would be getting a head start. So, when they come into school, they will not be struggling or behind everyone else.\n \n Students could get a challenge or a choice to choose what they want, benefiting them and their interests. If students came up with the assignments, they could be too easy. Teachers know a students limit by their academic skills. If students had a challenge in the summer, it could be something they have never experienced before or thought about. Students would be learning and enjoying their summer at the same time.\n \n Summer assignments should be relevant to society and not useless information. Teachers are usually aware of what is going on in society, whether that is economically or politically. They could make a summer assignment about an issue in our society. If there was a summer assignment like that, there would be many online resources to help the students since it is a current topic. This would also benefit the students by enlightening them in the problems of their own society and community.\n \n In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher-designed to benefit the student. Not all summer assignments are boring. They might require you to read a book or do some research, but it would help you in the near future. Students who do summer assignments are less likely to be confused or behind in class, since they had a preview of what they were learning. Teacher-designed summer assignments benefit students by giving them a head start on what they are learning, the assignment could be a challenge or a choice, and the topics could relate to society making it more relevant.Â",

      "During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education.\n \n When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students.\n \n A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project.\n \n In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses.\n \n Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.",

      "During the school year, classroom instructions and lessons are prepared and taught by the teachers, so why wouldn't the summer assignments that keeps kids prepared for school, be made by teachers ? Summer assignments allow students the chance to stay ahead of their classwork and curriculum while they are away from school. These assignments help kids in many ways, whether it be to prepare for the SAT, ACT, or just a little head start for an advanced placement class. Teachers know the curriculum of their classes better than some principles, so it is only right that these assignments be prepared by the teachers themselves. Teachers need to be in charge with making their summer assignments because they may have specific ways they want their incoming students to learn, they have the most experience in the subject they teach, and students may be exposed to new styles of learning that could help them far beyond just school.\n \n Teacher-made summer assignments are great for preparing kids for the next chapter of school. With that being said, student-designed assignments would not be such a bad alternative. Students only grasp knowledge and lectures when they find interest in them. What better way on finding out how summer assignments can interest students, then to just let the students come up with the layout of the assignments themselves. Nobody can relate to students more then themselves. Some students are hands on learners while others are more visual learners, students could come up with multipleÂ assignment designs that meets the needs of physical and visual learners. Summer assignments that are made by teachers in one way may not help a physical learner but aid the visual learner, or vice versa and that would not be fair to either student.\n \n At all schools, teachers have a required curriculum they must teach to their students in a certain time period. Allowing the teachers to make the projects would greatly reduce the time spent in the classroom on going backwards in their curriculum to catch students up, and allow them to move forward faster. Many colleges around the world look at the scores of students SAT's and ACT's. These two test have a certain amount of curriculum that is covered through all years of learning. Unfortunately, many teachers do not have enough time to cover all the material on the two tests. Summer assignments give kids that extra needed practice and knowledge to do well on the tests.\n \n The SAT and ACT are not the only test students have to take while they are in school. Students also must take subject specific test and quizzezs for their individual teachers. Since, teachers are responsibleÂ for making their own test for the students, they may have a specific way they want their students to study or look over the material, summer projects are no different. Teachers are human, each one of them has a different method of teaching and testing. By allowing the teacher to design their summer project, it allows for kids to be ready for the methods their teacher uses to test and lecture. Not only could the methods of learning be new to the student, but they also could prefer their teacher's new ways more than what they used in the past.\n \n Summer Projects should be teacher made because they cover materials that students will need to use in the classroom and also show's the student kinda how the teacher likes to teach and deliver the curriculum in the classroom. Teachers go to college for 4 years just so they can teach people. They are the most qualified in helping any person succeed academically. If you are a parent, tell me honestly, would you trust your own child in coming up with their own school assignments ? Â Â Â Â  Â",

      "Why are student-designed summer projects beneficial?\n \n School is important for everyone. The law is that everyone who is born in the United States must attend school. School is a time where you study to get good grades, develop strong bonds with teachers and friends, and having a fun time. During the school year, students get to choose what classes do they want to take. After students select what classes they want to take for next year, they usually get summer assignments or summer projects to prepare them for the upcoming school year. In other states, summer projects or summer assignments are either teacher-designed or student-designed. I always preferred that summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning.\n \n Doing a project brings astonishing ideas to a student. When the teacher gives a simple task to do a project by using tri-fold display boards, construction paper, and color; it gives the student the freedom of what they want to create. Students grow a mindset of what will help them. Some students do well by being creative because some of themÂ are visual learners. Visual learners understand materials by looking at a specific picture to capture the concept, so it can be a part of their memory. When creative students start coloring; it gives them less stress. Less stress causes to work faster and gives relief, and it helps them to make a nice presentation. Creativity also brings the teachers attention when it's time to present. Teachers will see that these creative students took their time to make a neat artwork and helped them to understand their assignment by designing it themselves.\n \n Self-studying prevents the student to be behind. Self-studying can be hard at first, but once you understand how to do it and manage it; therefore, it becomes easier. Studying by yourselfÂ doesn't make youÂ re-read, highlight, and memorize the textbook the whole day. UseÂ different ways to study such as doing projects, making flashcards, or teaching it to a friend. Most of these self-study learners make detailed projects to make it enjoyable for them, and it can make them motivated. For example, you are taking an biology class in the fall. Your assignment says to make a project that makes you notice nature. You come up with a brilliant idea and make a bird feeder. You use creative ideas along the way such as making a bird feeder out of an old milk carton. After that, you put half of the seeds inside and the other half on the ground.Â To observe your data, you would see which type of birds came to your feeder, what time, and what day of the week. This shows that you noticed nature by motivation and self studying by making data.\n \n During the summer, students learn new material for their future classes. When learning about new knowledge during break, it makes students more engaged. Students don't have a deadline when they can study, so they take it easy by doing it step by step. Since some students get bored over the summer, they get curious to find new things. There are students who make their own projects to see how intelligent they are in that subject. By making projects, students have the will to discover their learning path. They have the time to go out to different museums or national parks for ideas for their project. They notice what they can establish in their future life by observing areas, so then they research more to make their summer project even better. The students designed their own projects by having the time to explore around themselves, making experiments, and taking risks. All of this helps them to engage their learning.\n \n In conclusion, projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning. Making summer projects that are student-designed helps learning grow and makes teachers proud of what their students can accomplish. Student-designed projects give no procrastination, spend more time with friends, and manages your time easily. This is why student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed projects. Â Â Â",

      "The idea of summer projects for students is a great way to assure that they are continuing to learn outside of school independently. This is true when the students have the freedom and responsibility to choose which subject they want to deepen their knowledge about. Although teachers have the ability to design specific projects that relate directly to the curriculum, students would find completing their projects more enjoyable if they had the freedom to research a topic that they experienced first hand, as well as displaying an opportunity to those who travel and may research different cultures.\n \n Schools that allow the students to design their summer projects may include a list of topics provided by teachers to assure all students remain on task with the curriculum as well as develop a passion for their topic. With a list of examples provided, students may get creative with ideas and become passionate about their work, which should be the most important goal schools attempt to get their student to achieve. With passion, students become motivated to continue studying even when it is summer break.\n \n Moreover, those fortunate enough to travel have endless possibilities when designing their projects: from the chemical makeup of jet planeÂ fuel to the traditionsÂ and customs of villages in third world countries, there is no limit. By being able to experience new cultures, examine pieces of art work, sight seeÂ great monuments, etc..., students may design extravagant projects that expose others to what they have experienced. When students present their project at the beginning of the following school year, those who did not get to travel may learn about topics they weren't able to experience themselves, making all students inclusive in eachothers summer activities.\n \n Although some may believe that teachers should design the student's projects, this should not be the case if schools wish for their students to learn to be responsible and independent. If teachers were to design the projects, yes, it would be guaranteed that it follows the curriculum, but there will be a clear lack of passion in the student's work. Forcing a topic students have no interest in or are unable to experience first hand will bring the students to resent learning during their break. And for those traveling, some may not have access to specific requests the teachers assign, forcing them to either return home to complete their project or to produce something mediocre. Students being able to design their own project that works best around their schedule would benefit everyone.\n \n Schools who allow students to design their own projects are giving the opportunity to be creative, independent, and responsible. With passion mixed in, possibilities for greatness are endless. Schools that have teachers design projects should reconisder and follow the schools that allow students' footsteps.",

      "Education is, without a doubt, a necessity in order to ensure a successful life- and it is the school's job to give the students exactly that. During the school year, they do so with classes and homework, but what about when school is already over? Many schools opt to let the students rest during these times, but some schools decide to take it up another step with summer projects. How the projects should be conducted, though, has been a matter of debate recently, and many are taking different positions and stances on the issues, largely divided into two different sides: teacher-directed and student-directed. The teacher-directed side believes that the teachers should take the lead and decide what they expect from the project, while the student-directed side believes that giving the students more freedom in what to do will allow them to learn more in the process. While it is easy to see how students would like a project designed by themselves, school projects should still be primarily designed and directed by the teachers.\n \n To start, teacher-designed projects allow for a more intuitive and in-depth project that students could not develop on their own. A human's brain does not develop fully adulthood; it is immature, and as such, leaves students prone to make decisions that may harm their own education. Furthermore, teachers have gone through rigorous training and have an intimate knowledge of their own subject, and thus can create projects that are on topic and beneficial to a student's education; on the other hand, students are only beginning to learn their subjects, and do not have the proper training or the knowledge required to create a project that allows them to learn.\n \n However, some may think that teacher-designed projects limit creativity and make the projects overall less enjoyable for the students. It is easy to think that way, but by limiting some creativity, teachers are actually ensuring proper education during the summer. If a student designed a project, for example, they could deliberately make the project simple, giving themselves an easy grade when, in reality, they learned nothing. To continue, the students could derail the project, straying away from what the teacher or school intended for them. All of these and more make the projects pointless and a waste of resources and time, but teacher-designed projects ensure that students stay on topic, while also raising the quality and benefits of the projects by requiring a bare minimum.\n \n Finally, teacher-designed projects allow for a standardized rubric that makes grading easier and simpler for teachers. Student-designed projects can be anything, especially since the teachers do not have control over them. Consequently, the teachers must adapt in response to the varied project types and qualities, making a rubric harder to define. This means that teachers require more time and effort to grade each project, making an already exhausting task even more arduous. However, a teacher-designed project is the same for every student, meaning everyone makes the same thing about the same topics. This lets the teachers focus on assessing more important skills and the quality of the project instead of checking solely completion.\n \n In short, a student-designed project simply cannot provide the in-depth education that a teacher-designed project gives. Summer break, while it is indeed a break, does not mean education ever stops. It is up to summer projects- and teachers, consequently- to keep it that way.",

      "Summer projects can be a helpful tool for both teachers and students to ensure that students will be ready for the next school year and not forget what they learned the previous year. Summer projects should be enriching, creative, and fun for students. While a student-designed project may be creative and fun, it would most likely lack the enrichment component which is the whole point of having summer projects. Ultimately, teachers know better than students how to prepare for the upcoming school year, which is why these summer projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Student-designed projects may sound like a good idea at first, but students would not be able to create a project that would prepare themselves well enough for the next year; at least not the same way teachers can. Students are already unmotivated to do any summer homework let alone projects. However, there is definitely an appeal to creating your own projects, which would help motivate students to complete and do a good job with the project. Most likely though, if students were given free reign to design their summer project themselves, they would take advantage of the opportunity and make a project that is too easy and in the end, unhelpful. This outcome would be even worse than just doing a teacher-designed project which would actually help students.\n \n Teachers know exactly how to prepare students for the next year, so although their project may be harder and not as fun, it would pay off in the long run and help students develop important skills they would need for the next year. Because the goal of summer projects is to make sure students are learning over break, teachers tend to focus too much on the content of the project and often do not make the project creative or fun. Often times, a teacher-designed summer project will be to read a book, analyze it, and write an ESSAY about it. These types of projects are not fun for students, and the result would be a clear lack of effort from the student. I myself have experienced this, and know firsthand that students need to be interested in the project to ensure quality work. In order to avoid this and cater to students creativity, teachers should design multiple projects for students to choose from incorporating various skills such as art, writing, or research. This way, students have a choice and can pick whichever project they would have the most fun doing.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know what they are doing better than students, and can make summer projects fun for the student while also helping them continue learning for the next year. Teachers can always get feedback from students and implement new ideas on how to improve the same project to make it better for the next year, whereas students would not be able to do this. With having more experience and knowledge, it is best that the design of summer projects be left to the teachers.Â",

Knowing some of the knowledge will make the students dive deeper into the material and learn new things. Creativity allows students to think outside the box and explore beyond technology. Giving students the responsibility of choosing their own subject would make them interested into doing their project and enjoy making it.\n \n Students should do their projects based on what they are most familiar with. It would make it easier for them to do a project based on what they already know, so they would most likely start it immediately. They could also search through the web for new information. They benefit from it because they get to learn new material and are able to use it for the project. Although searching through the web is easy and fast, they could also visit places related to what their subject is about and collect new information from the place they visited. They can learn by being physically there and understand deeper by doing hands on work.\n \n Creativity allows them to think outside the box. Depending on the subject, they could experiment new things. They could use their mind freely and do whatever they would like to do. For example, teachers would be strict about what they would like the students to do and use but since you are free to be creative; you would be able to organize the information however you want it to be organized and how to introduce your project.

      "Certain schools make students complete a summer project to make sure students are still learning over their summer break. There is an ongoing debate over if teachers should design these projects or if students should. Some believe that the student should design the project because it is their summer break and it gives them time to be creative but this is not true. Teachers should design the summer project, not the students.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why teachers should design the project. Teachers purpose in this is to make sure the students project is educational and will benifit them in the long run. A teacher is a professional and will most likey pick a topic that will help them through the summer untill they get to school. Students might pick a topic or design their project on something that might not benefit them significantly educationally. Along with teacher design would come clear and formal instructions. Provided the teacher designs the project the instrustions should be crystal clear and students will be on the right path and most likely less confused than if they had to do it all themselves. Teacher design will aswell booost the project in looking more formal provided rubric can show expectations that need to be met. When teachers provide a project for their class, everyone has the same assignment, and it not only makes it easier for them but the students. This makes said project still formal but everyone can add their creative skills making it more personal giving it their own twist. With the same summer project and teachers permission, it would aswell be easier to work with others and share ideas. Teacher design benefits the students.\n \n There are further reasons on why teachers should be the ones designing students projects. Teachers know what will benefit the students, preparing them for their next year. Edcationally they will design a project based to fit their class and that will help their students. This is teachers being hard working and picking themselves what is best for their students. As stated previously everyone having the same project would benefit the teachers aswell. Multiple projects after a long summer is hard to grade but with everyone having the same assignment and rubric it would make it easier for the hard working teachers. The teacher deciding and designing how they would want their project would asvwell be a plus for them. They decide how they want it as well as theirs expectations, which makes it clearer for the student to unerstand as stated previously. Teachers designing the summer/schiool year projects benefit both students and teachers.\n \n The summer project should be designed by the teachers and not the students. There are many reasons why teachers should design it, for example it makes it easier for both the teachers and the students in the long run. those who disagree state that it would make it easier, more creative, and fun for the students but realistically this is not true. School work at anytime of the year should be designed and given by the school, this puts order in the school system.",

      "Schools should have summer projects be teacher-designed because teachers will pick projects that they know will be usefull to students, teachers put their full time and effort, and teachers will also make the project enjoyable to the students.\n \n Teachers have created many projects for many of their students, making them have a lot more credibility than students to construct a project. Teachers will know what information will be on the project makin it easier for them to construct projects that they know will be of use to students in the future. They all have insight on what a student should learn and what a student should not learn because they have been teaching all year long to students. They would take out all the useless information because they know how to filter it out, while students are learning themselves and will not know how to identify usefull information from useless making teachers more credible on the projects that would be assigned to students. Teachers can also make this project very clear and precise so that students will not get confused on what to do, how to research it, and how to write it professionally, unlike students who always go out of their way to make the project more lengthy and the basis of the project a lot more confusing to understand. Teacher know about the main ideas or concepts about these projects while students are unaware of these main ideas because they are yet to learn about it.\n \n So many teachers put so much time and effort into teaching their class everyday for an eight-month period, which makes it easier for them to create projects because they are so comfortable in this type of creative/learning environment. They put maximum effort to make all this information very precise and straight to the point while students usually, when it does not affect their grade, slack the work load by doing creating he project half-heartedly and not with their full time making the learning experience for the students researching the project also not as fulfilled to learn. When people make it seem like they put their full effort into teaching you about something, that sense or feeling that they invested a part of time into making your learning experience a lot more impactful, you are more compelled to study and learn about what they are teaching you and telling you to pracitce, which is what teacher do and are meant to do. Teachers will always have the time to give out and make projects because that is their job and they have to take it serious unlike students who either creating the project is not fulfilled to do their part or students just do not have the time of day to invest their time into projects. If students do take an investment of time to create these projects, they will not be able to focus on the other important things that they have to get done.\n \n Teachers also have a way of making learning a lot more fun and interactive on their daily teaching schedule, therefore, making them have a way to encapture a students attention into making these projects a lot more enthusiastic and enjoyable to research on. Teachers also make the projects a lot less objective based learning, teachers want to make sure that you understand the content to its fullest extent while also maintaining a curiousness towards the basis of the project, unlike students who make the project seem very boring, uninteresting, and very objective based learning which will make students to never research anything about that certain topic again because they could not learn anything fun about it or there was no interactiveness between the students and the project they were assignes to.\n \n In short, teachers have a better advantage and a lot more insight on how to design these projects because they know what information that will be of use to students, they put the maximum amount of time and effort, and they make the learning experience more enthusiastic and enjoyable to the students doing research on them. Teachers always seem to have the upper hand about how to pass off knowledge and wisdom because of these reasons.Â Â",

      "As a student, the summer projects should be teacher-designed projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed projects due to the fact that teachers know what the students need to learn in the next grade. For an example, in first grade you learn how to add and subtract using double digit number, if the teachers designs the project for the summer you will have more knowledge about adding and subtracting. Also, teachers know the material to help you succeed in school. Not to mention that if the student designs it how would students gain knowledge of it? As students, they would rather have easier homework and easier projects rather than homework and projects the will benefit you. Lastly, teachers know what is needed to know in the upcoming grade; So the teacher-designed can help them prepare for the next grade.\n \n Student based projects are not a good idea for several different reasons. The student-designed projects are not beneficial to students due to the fact that students don't know what is going to be learned in the next grade level, so how they going to know how their own project is going to benefit themselves? As for teachers, they are going to know what is coming up in the upcoming grade. Another reason is due to the fact that students are going to do a easy projects. Not all easy projects benefit you to have more knowledge, therefore teachers design the projects so that students could gain more knowledge off the project. Lastly, the teacher-design project is going to prepare you for the next grade, so you will be more advanced with subject when you get in the class next year.\n \n To sum up, Teacher-design summer project benefit you in many different ways. It can benefit you by working to learn upcoming material. Teacher-design projects also benefits you by teachers knowing what is needed to know in the next grade. Finally, it benefits you because teachers know what is coming up in the upcoming grade level, so it helps you prepare for the next grade level. Student-designed can also benefit you in gaining knowledge, but not as much knowledge from teachers-designed projects.",

      "Most students look forward to the last few days of school, those last few moments when the bell is about to ring and they can all go and hang out, or just go home and relax. After a whole school year's worth of work they are ready to take a nice break. But then those hopes are ultimately hurt a little when a teacher announces that the students are to complete projects over the summer. These projects should be student designed because of the work being assigned over vacation, giving the students a chance to self-govern themselves, and because they will have extra free time to work with.\n \n Some teachers would agree that if the students were to assign themselves projects, nothing would get done, or the students would not learn anything new. This really should not matter in the long term as the teachers already have enough control during the school year, and the students really should be allowed a break from all this learning. If the students do not get the break they might need, than what is the point of a vacation?\n \n Speaking of that vacation, students need that time to relax and unwind, preparing themselves for the next year. Some parents might even have big vacation plans over the summer to take their families interesting places. This means that a student will have to work his or her summer homework around the vacation time, which, in some cases, can be really challenging. One student might have a big project to get done, but their parents announce that they are taking a family vacation to Germany for a couple of weeks. Of course, this might not seem like a lot of time, when school stops, that does not mean everything else does as well. These students might have jobs to keep up with or other responsibilities outside of school, these projects just make things even harder than they need to be. When you give students a larger window to finish something, they get the chance to improve their leadership skills, either in a group, or with themselves.\n \n Students who design their own projects will get the chance to self-govern themselves, meaning they have more time to make creative decisions that can improve the project, rather than just having a week or so to finish it where they might rush it, or cannot dedicate enough time outside of school to get it done in time, lowering the overall quality. When students get to make these creative decisions, they can make the students think in new ways and bring out more interesting decisions to make the projects stand out a little more. All of this culminates in the extra free time the students have to think, execute, and produce a well-made product.\n \n The extra free time gives students more freedom to try more ambitious projects without the pressure of all the work that needs to be done within a week. The project will be able to develop naturally over time. If teachers assign these projects, then either the student will feel less compelled to do it, or it will not turn out as well because the student might not want to do that type of project in the first place. This extra free time is a great source for creativity and good student led projects because the students will be more compelled to do the work right, rather than just get through it so they can actually enjoy their break.\n \n Overall, these students would really feel bummed if they were required to do extra work over the summer for seemingly no reason at all, other than to continue learning. With student-designed projects, students will still get to enjoy their vacation, while learning more about self-governing, and making good use of their extra free time. Going to school is not something that everyone in the world enjoys, but is required, so if the teachers are really going to strip away some of the student's free time, at least let the students be in control. If you give the children more freedom, the creative results may be beyond anything you have ever seen.",

      "Summer school projects should be student lead because they allow students to keep their brain fresh, achieve a goal, and understand new concepts. School projects over the summer should be student designed. This allows students to keep their brain active, have a goal to accomplish, and learn new things. Projects to complete over the summer are a good tool for schools to use to keep their students ready.\n \n Some students might think a project for school over the summer is tyranny, however, keeping your brain thinking is very important. An interesting project, that should be mainly student-designed so completion is high, is a good brain helper. A benefit of the project will be once the students go back to school, it'll be easier to jump back into familiar topics because your brain has had a refresher recently. Freshman year of high schoolÂ I had an English project over the summer on Mythology which greatly helped me when I returned to school and Mythological stories was our first unit. Overall, keeping your brain up-to-date is an excellent way to be confident in your schooling career.\n \n During summer break a lot of kids end up being bored at home just watching TV or playing video games. A project, designed by students so the kids can stay engaged and interested, could shake this monotony and give the student a goal to accomplish. Goals are important and they lead to the person feeling good about themselves once they complete said goal. On the other hand, a student might say how they don't need a goal to stay active during the summer but they can always benefit from something to hold them accountable so just in case the student starts heading on a downward trend, the goal can lift them up and set them back on track.\n \n Learning new things is an important task to do often. Having a student lead project is a great strategy to allow kids to find and learn new things, explore new concepts, and complete tasks efficiently. Kids learning new things over the summer with a rigorous yet interest-grabbing project is an excellent way to expand the classroom horizon once school is back in session. It allows the teacher to make new teaching decisions such as what projects will look like in the future, what kind of strategies to teach with, and if said teacher can branch off into side topics that they usually couldn't branch off into.\n \n In conclusion, school-assigned projects should be student-designed so interest and completion is high, goals are made and completed, and the students' brain is kept in top shape. The ability a kid has to learn by themselves over the summer should be tapped into by schools more often. Projects to complete over the summer are a perfect tool to keep kids fresh and ready for when school starts back up.",

Students are constantly given assignmentsÂ of which they have chosen and yet, some still never take the addictiveÂ to do the work to help them succeed.

Students should have a teacher-designed project because it would encourage them, there would be guidelines and less stress on choosing a topic.\n \n Firstly, some people doÂ not that have the motivation to do a projects and they need something to help keep them on track and push them to do it. Some students have a problem withÂ procrastination when it comes to big assessments such as projects, an ESSAY, or even a simple PowerPoint. For example, they have a 600 word ESSAY due in 2 weeks and its worth 30% of their grade. They will wait 2 days before it is due to finally take time and do it. If a teacher were to have something they have to work toward that they would really want to would drive them to do their best.\n \n Secondly, when there are guidelines to a project it gives that sense of urgency. A project or any assignment should be done without some source of instruction or direction on what to do. For example, if they were given an assignment and just told to do it would come out extremely unorganized. Teachers being in charge of a summer project is much better than students handling it because they have deadlines for each part of the project\n \n However some students want to do a project on something they chose and feel as though they need help with. For example, there is a student who has aced every single lesson that the teacher has taught but, the last lesson that they learned they really had a hard time on understanding it and its time for the projects the be assigned. They were assigned something that they knew with their eyes closed. Although, that may be true having a teacher-designed project is a lot easier because all they would have to is do the work instead of stressing about what they can do their project on.\n \n In conclusion, when an assignedÂ is monitored by a teacher it is more likely to go smoother than leaving the responsible to get their work done up to them to decide.

      "Summer projects is an excellent way for students to continue learning and to grow academically during breaks while having fun doing it. When teachers assign projects which is designed by them, it decreases the student's motivation to complete the project because students find it amusing to design and create their own projects and not the other way around. Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to research many topics which they could potentially be interested in. Summer projects during the break should be student-designed because it increases student motivation to complete the project, students are able to gain knowledge on something they came up with themselves, and they are able to have fun while conducting research on their own topics.\n \n The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because of the increase in motivation. Students are motivated when they are interested in what the project is about. When the project is teacher-designed, student's lack the motivation to complete the task as they could be uninterested in the project the teacher had assigned them. Some students might assume the project will be tedious because the teacher is assigning it and as a result, feel unmotivated. For example, When the teacher assigns a project, it can be difficult to research and come up with ideas which leads to the students feeling stressed and confused on what to do regarding the project. But when a student designs their own projects, they probably already have an idea or information on the topic of their project. Another example is when students are assigned a project, and there is a choice to organzie and create your own project for extra credit, students are motivated to perorm well on the project. That is why schools should have students perform research on their own project topic because it motivates them to get it nicely done. An increase in motivation means an increase in the quality of the project and the thought of satisfaction while completing it\n \n The second reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to gain a tremendous amount of knowledge as they are coming up with their own ideas on researching, creating, and completing their own projects. For example, during the break, multiple students travel out of state or out of the country. When the students go on vacation, they will locate lots of great topics and ideas to research on. Therefore, increasing the student's knowledge on the topic or idea of the project. This causes the students to become more erudite during the break and when they return back to school from the break. Although the students will still gain knowledge on a teacher-designed project, they do not gain a much broader view on the topic of the project. Another example is when a student works at someplace he or she enjoys working at and decides to do their project on that particular job. This is going to increase the sudent's knowledge as the student is researching more information about the job whilst also learning more about the place he or she works at.\n \n The third reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to have fun while conducting a research on their topic. Students always want something fun to do; therefore, by designing their own projects, they are able to make it as fun as they want. When the teacher designs the project, the students would probably assume that it is dull. For example, when a student does something for fun over the break, they could do their project on what they did instead of doing a project on something they have never done before. Another example is when a teacher-designed project is assigned and the teacher is extremely facetious about what and what not to include in the project. When this happens, the students won't find the project to be amusing or interesting.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed as it greatly benefits the students in many ways such as motivating them, allowing them to gain more knowledge, and having fun whilst working on the project. When teachers design projects for their students, they are not allowing the students to fully expand into many areas but allowing them to conduct a research and work on their project in a way they want it to be done, which limits the students ability to be motivated to work on the project, to gain knowledge on the project, and to enjoy working on the project.",

      "In some schools, projects are given to students to be completed over summer break. The reason a vigarious assignment is given is to assure students will be continuously learning over the summer when schools are temporarily closed. However, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Teacher-designed projects should be required for all students. Why should teacher-designed projects be a requirement instead of student-designed projects? Teacher-designed projects expand learning and the teacher is aware of what the students will be learning.\n \n To begin, teachers will be aware that all students are obtaining the same information. For example, a project was given by a teacher specifically on the topic saving and investing in today's economy. The teacher knows that all students will be researching and learning the concepts of saving and investing today. All students gained identical information and knowledge on one specific topic. On the other hand, if projects were student-designed there will be little unity of knowledge amongst students who are of equal age and grade classification.\n \n To continue, teacher-designed projects will expand the knowledge of students. If projects were student-designed they would more likely focus on a topic they already have prior knowledge about rather than stepping outside of their comfort zone. Teacher-designed projects tend to include circulum that students need to know that will help them grow academically. For instance, a group of girls in a high schoolÂ class were given a black history project. They did their project on Misty Copeland, an African-American ballet dancer, who they had previously researched before. They had information instilled into their minds and had already known about her accomplishments and struggles. They did not learn anything about her, because they had done projects before. With that being said, students will not willingly learn anything new if they designed their on projects. Teacher-designed projects would have a more positive impact, because it is being given by a teacher who can academically prepare students for the next school year.\n \n Last but not least, teacher-designed projects enforce specific directions and learning criteria. The projects will less likely be done incorrectly. Directions and criteria is specific, so it will not be off topic and the students will not be learning unnecessary information that will not help them. Teacher-designed projects are more focused on criteria that students need to know.\n \n Conversely, student-designed projects can be more engaging for students who like to be creative, or do things in their own manner. The options are limitless and researching what a student wants to learn will inspire them to obtain more knowledge to share with their peers. Students will be more interested in a project they can create themselves and that leads to results such as less cheating. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects should be required, because some students will focus on what they already know rather than willingly learning something new. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly.\n \n In conclusion, teacher-designed projects will not limit students to what they already know, but will help them grow academically. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly,Â because the teacher specifies instructions and limits the topics for their projects. Students will flourish more when projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed. Schools should require summer projects that are teacher-designed.Â",

Summer projects designed by students would more efficient than ones designed by teachers.\n \n There are various reasons why student-designed are better at promoting learning during Summer. Students will have more choices of what they can learn about instead of being restricted to what a teacher assigns them for that class. This means students can research subjects ,outside of the curriculum,Â that they may be interested in for their project. Learning about what interests them will motivate students to work harder on their task. Students will want to put more into their project in because it's personal to them, unlike projects designed by teachers. In addition, students won't feel like their time is being wasted on something they see no benefit in. Teacher-designed projects such as research papers, posters, and presentations can be mundane and seem utterly pointless. Students will want to prioritize jobs, relaxation and their social life over a project that they don't have any interest in.\n \n There are additional reasons as to why summer projects should be designed by students. Students will have to complete the project they made on their own free time. This will prepare them for the future, where they have to be responsible enough to set up and accomplish goals independently, without anyone demanding them to. Teachers often make projects that require students to reach very high standards. Failing to meet these standards usually results in failure of the project, which can be stressful. Student-designed projects allow students to reach their own standards, which can make Summer break less stressful. Finally, student-designed summer projects give students something to look forward to. They can be productive and learn without feeling like their summer vacation is being intruded by school work.\n \n Projects assigned during summer break would be more beneficial when designed by students rather than teachers. This is because it causes less stress, makes the students responsible for their work, and motivates them. Those who are opposed to this state teacher-designed projects encourage critical thinking, and learning during Summer, but this is not the case.

      'Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their break. The most simple thing to do, is to have the teachers design the projects, but why not let the students think for themselves. My take on this, is that students should have to put a little effort in, for once. Summer projects should be student-designed because they deserve some freedom, can show off their intelligence, and will help them develop life skills.\n \n Some may say teachers are more educated and have more experience; That might be true, but how are the students supposed to get a real experience if they never get to design their own project. My friends like when a teacher gives the class a project that is already planned out. The reason they enjoy this is because they are lazy and do not have to do any work. Teachers know a lot of information which should be passed on to their students. Although, that statement is true, when do the students get to pass their information to the teacher?\n \n Student-designed projects give the kids freedom in what they choose to do. At my old school, the students would have to read one book in the summer and then write a report on it. All my classmates would be so happy because they had the choice to read whatever they wanted. A teacher once told me, "freedom is a gift; We do not get that gift often and it is a mistake." This means, students are rarely given any freedom and all that does is limit them.\n \n Student-designed projects would help teachers see how intelligent their students are. In\n \n Kung Fu Panda , Master Shifu learns from watching Po move around the kitchen, that he has plenty of skill. In that scene, the master learns how much potential the student has by watching him do his own thing. In middle school, we would do our summer projects based on any news topic we read. This allowed the teachers to not only get an idea of who the students are, but also show them a baseline of how smart they are, as well.\n \n The projects that students self-design will help them develop life skills. A student creating a project on their own teaches them responsibility and problem solving. The student will have to find a solution to their topic, which shows responsibility by being able to complete this task well enough, to receive a good grade. My father believes summer projects he had to create on his own assisted him to where he is today. My dad thinks this because it showed him time management, which is a life skill students will need forever.\n \n Summer projects are meant to help students continue to learn over a long break. Although, why not make summer projects have more value? Instead, schools can help the students do more than just learn over break. Summer projects should be student-designed because they should have choice, will show off their intellect, and assists them in developing life skills. The school systems need to work together, to take action on making student-designed projects a priority, for getting students the best education.Â',

      "Should summer projects be Teacher-designed, or Student-designed? I believe that summer projects should be mainly Student-designed, with teacher approval. I believe this because of my own personal experiences. Students that I've seen who receive summer projects are not very interested, if ever interested, in the project assignments they receive. A way to get them more engaged is to have them pick a topic they would be interested in. As long as it pertains to the class of course, this is where teacher approval would take place.\n \n I believe summer projects should be Student-designed. One of the reasons I believe this is because I've seen students struggle with assignments they don't like, so much so, it can come to a point where they either give up,Â or don't even attempt it. My second reason is because it adds a level of involvement from the student, that ensures they're aware of how the assignment is to be done, as well as, their own personal spin on what their project is going to be.\n \n Summer projects should be Student-designed because prompts given by teachers can be quite boring, causing a lack of drive to finish the project, let alone attempt it. Some kids partake in summer jobs, or leave for vacation. The situation concerning the varying student should be reflected in their summer projects as being individualized. What I mean for this is, a student who is busy all the time doesn't always have the time to do a project. Even if they enjoy the content. The form of their project should also vary due to their location. Weather they're traveling all the time, and can only complete the project on an airplane, or maybe they live in an environment without constantÂ Wifi. Giving the student the opportunity to form their own assignment can add a level of enjoyment, to an already chaotic lifestyle thatÂ any student could be living with. Rather the alternative. A standardized project that only 65% of students are likely to turn in.\n \n My Second reason is the level of involvement shown by a student who gets to choose their own topic. Not only will they be more involved, and in sync with what they need to accomplish, they will be able to complete it faster, if not better than they would without their own involvement. Showing this type of involvement can help the student have a better understanding on what their end goal is, and how they can accomplish it, resulting in better work. As well as readiness in the classroom when they come back from summer break. Seeing as how the students don't receive teacher guidance over the summer, if they have a full understanding on their own project, it can result to having a better understanding for the transition into the next year.\n \n Someone who would disagree with my statements would believe that Teacher-designed summer projects are much better for the student. Some reasons for this would be, an extra workload on the student, or possible inappropriate content chosen by the student. In a students life there can be little free time, as life is different for eachÂ student, and adding on the creation of their own project, just adds onto the workload for both teachers and students.\n \n In conclusion I believe that summer projects should be student oriented. A student can show more interest in a personalized project. Secondly a student can gain a better comprehension on what theyre trying to learn from their own project that they enjoy. While some would say that it's an extra burden on teachers to add individualized projects, I believe that the American education system needs to be less standardized. and more individual. We all learn differently, and not every method of teaching is helpful t'words a students education.",

      "As summer starts to roll around, students usually start taking their school work less and less seriously. WhenÂ students are in control of what they are doing, or working on, they are more likely to complete what they started. When a student gets assigned to complete something its harder for them to finish, or to start at all.\n \n These summer projects should be student-designed because students tend to do better when they enjoy what they are working on. When teachers assign work for students to complete, they design it in a more complex manner rather than taking a simpler approach. Many students have more ideas which interest them, that the teachers might not consider, or think of when designing these projects. When teachers design these projects they lead to no benefits on either side. Students should be able to use their imagination and creativity while being on summer break as wellÂ as their knowledge.\n \n Students are always limited when it comes to teacher-designed projects. Such as when a student is assigned something that does not pertain to their life or the real world. This always leads to inactivity or procrastination which then leads to no work being done at all. This also almost never interests the student which makes the work harder, and less easy to focus on. Over the course of a month or two, people in general tend to get bored of things quickly, so it is always good to be working on something that interests them, or that they enjoy.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can also be a good thing as it can guide a student on where to start. It can also give them ideas on what to do, but it is also a gateway for them to not get as good of a grade as they could have gotten if they used their full potential. For example, when a student gets assigned to write a persuasive ESSAY, they would most likely not incorporate any of their own ideas, but rather things they read from other sources. If the student wrote an auto biography on themselves that would spark their interest because it pertains to their own life. They would not have to go out of their way to use sources on something they do not care for.\n \n All in all students should be in control of what they are working on in their own free time, a time especially like summer. When something like a summer assignment is assigned to a student they should automatically have the right to design their own project. They should be able to base their work off their own ideas. When a student is designing their own project they have the best way of knowing exactly what they are doing, which will lead to better results. Lastly they should not have to worry about meeting someones' expectations but their standards,so them designing their own project will lead to less stress as well.",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer vacation offers a wonderful opportunity for adventure, creativity, and imagination often needed during a young adult's adolescence. However, many children and teens often lose their sense of work ethic during the summer, something that they worked so hard to achieve throughout the school year. To retain this sense of work ethic during the summer, many schools often require students to complete summer projects for a grade. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to ensure the project is on the right topic and to leave no room for error during grading or cheating.\n \n Firstly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to leave no room for error during grading and to eliminate the possibility of cheating. When teachers design their own projects for their students, they have a clear picture of what is required of their students and how to grade them to a high standard. To ensure this, for example, teachers create rubrics that match exactly how they want projects to be done. This leaves no room for error in student projects, as they can follow word for word what the rubric says with no confusion. When students do not have rubrics and are tasked at designing a project for themselves, it is more time consuming for the teacher, as they have to grade each project individually, leaving more room for error as the projects are open-ended, and unfair as each student is then held at a different standard due to uniqueness of projects. Another example of leaving no room for error is a teacher's use of the website\n \n Turnitin. com. Turnitin is a website that teachers use that examines grammar, spelling, use of proper citations, and plagiarism. This Einstein of a website ensures that every project, paper, and presentation that is written online can successfully be graded without the worry of plagiarism, something that lazy students often turn to as a result of desperation after a long period of procrastination. Summer projects that are teacher-designed can use\n \n Turnitin as a grading system to make sure that there is no plagiarismÂ or cheating between students in the school or county, as it would be hard to do if each project was student-based, because many students often prefer to submit their projects using paper-boards or by printing them. Even though the students could have easily plagiarized or cheating on their presentations, teachers will never know unless they use\n \n Turnitin and design the project for themselves. Summer projects should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed because it ensures that every students' project will be on the same topic and graded the same way to ensure fairness, accurate grading, and more time efficiency.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic. By letting teachers design their own summer projects, students are introduced early to what they will be learning throughout the school year in order to get back into the groove of schoolwork and school. An example of these projects are advanced placement biology courses that require summer projects. These advanced placement biology projects are teacher-designed, meaning that the topic, type of presentation, and rubric are already picked for students. When the project is teacher-designed, students are able to better grasp the details of the project and have an insight on what they are going to learn in the actual course. This also helps students come to school prepared, having foreknowledge of the topic the course starts with, which boosts confidence and ease in the class, as opposed to when students design their own summer projects, which may not even be about the core topics learned class, and eventually proven to be unnecessary. Another example of how teacher-designed projects ensure that every student is doing a project on the right topic is by requiring the student to do required reading and research before the class begins, such as in literary courses that require students to read specific books throughout the course. When students are required to read specific books, such as\n \n Lord of the Flies in tenth grade and\n \n The Great Gatsby in eleventh, students are less likely to read the book, instead opting for reading a summary of the book and spoilers online, and in some cases, watching the movie. When a student is tasked with designing their own project for a book or other topic, they always choose an easier, more simple topic that requires no effort or actual understanding of the book. However, when teachers design projects, they ask for specific knowledge of the events that happened the a book, requiring students to use quotes or examples from the text, essentially forcing them to actually do the reading and create an understanding for the book themselves. This is a good thing, because it ensures that the students are actually learning, as opposed to taking the easy way out of things and barely putting effort into their project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic because it gives students an understanding of what the course will be like to better prepare students for the fall and because it leaves no room for low-effort projects or mistakes.\n \n Though the summer is often associated with fun and adventure, it should leave no room for procrastination, a monster that eats at your work ethic and feeds on laziness. By having teacher-designed summer projects as opposed to student-designed ones, this eliminates procrastination and cheating, room for error in grading and student confusion, and gives student's an opportunity to get a head start in the course and come into the fall with a foreknowledge of the course at hand.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.\n \n When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.\n \n Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high schoolÂ college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.\n \n Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.\n \n In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as wellÂ due to the amount of time given.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Most schools in the United States require students to complete a summer project. Projects are assigned over the summer to assure students are learning over the long break. Most students want to enjoy their break without any school workÂ and wait until the last week of summer break to complete summer projects. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects are student-designed, students will be more creative, it gives students a senses of independence, and students will be able to explore areas of interest.\n \n However, some may disagree and say summer projects should be teacher-designed. They argue for this because if projects are student-designed they may off topic. This is a valid argument because it would make no sense if a student in a science class did a project about Fredrick Douglass. This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow. Nevertheless, their are other view points to consider.\n \n On the other hand, if summer projects were student-designed they would be more creative. Students would not be restricted and could express themselves in unique ways. In the last few decades or so, the government has made standards for students to meet. With theses standards in places teachers have to follow a very strict curriculum. More than ever before, teachers are teaching to the test which limits student creativity. With student-designed summer projects, students can express their creativity which they are limited to in the school year.\n \n In addition, allowing summer projects to be student-designed would let students to feel independent. As most students are restricted during the school year to a classroom, allowing students to design their own projects could mean they go to a local park and explore their community. In Tara Westover's memoir\n \n Educated , as a young girl she did not explore her community as a child due to her parents beliefs. As she grew up she wanted to go to college and experienceÂ something new. When she went to college it was very rewarding. This is because she was not restricted any more. Allowing students to design their own project could be a very rewarding feeling for them because of the independenceÂ they gain through it.\n \n Finally, if summer projects were to be student-designed it would allow students to explore areas of interest that may not correlate to a specific subject in school. If a student wanted to do a project about fast fashion, it does not make sense to do it in a world history, algebra, biology or band class. That is why it is beneficial to students if they design their own summer project. A student-designed summer project allows students to research a topic they might not be able to do in their classes during the school year.\n \n To conclude, letting students to design their own summer project is beneficial in more than one way. Students will be able to show off creativity that they might not show off in school. Student-designed projects gives students a sense of independence because they are not being told what to do. It also allows student to explore topics that are not taught in school. Student-designed projects have many benefits and could even lead to a careerÂ path in the future.",

    ESSAY:
      "Sometimes over the summer, teachers will assign summer projects to students. This can put a damper on some students' summers and overall make them unhappy. However, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects it would improve upon their learning and enjoyment of their break.\n \n A lot of the time when students are assigned a project on something they don't know much about or aren't very interested in, they'll be less inclined to do the project. For example, in third grade, I entered the science fair. For the competition we were able to choose our topic rather than be assigned one. My partner and I were much more excited after finding out we could choose because that meant we would get to do our research on something we were interested and passionate about. Our passion drove us to get first place in the science fair. I don't think we would have worked as hard or been as diligent if we hadn't had the ability to choose. Another time I think of choice impacting achievement is in eighth grade. My English teacher conducted an experiment without telling any of her students. In the first quarter of the year she assigned us a paper that we could write about any topic of our choice. Later, in the third quarter, she assigned us a paper with a prompt. Even though we had learned more writing skills and were more skilled authors by the third quarter, most of the ESSAY scores from the first quarter were better. She said just by reading the two different ESSAYs you could tell which subjects students were passionate about, and the grades reflected that. If students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose their topics, therefore inciting passion and improving upon grades.\n \n The main reason teachers assign summer projects is to add on to students' learning, right? Well, a lot of the time, if students are not interested in what they're learning, they're less prone to absorbing the information. Taking it back to my third grade science fair, a lot of my peers did a topic that their parents chose for them. Without that passion or drive behind their work, many of them did not take in any of the information they put on their tri-fold. My partner and I on the other hand, were very interested in our topic and wanted to learn as much as we could about it so we worked and studied hard. To this day I could still tell you how to make the best all natural carpet cleaner, and it was because we got to choose what our project was about. A more recent example from my life is my grades in my junior year courses. I'm personally enrolled in four classes this year, the two I see the biggest difference in grade are my film class and my math class. Film is a topic that I'm very interested in and makes me very happy. Math on the contrary, not so much. The two classes are polar opposites in the realm of stress vs. enjoyment, and my grades reflect that. It may have something to do with the course rigor, but in my opinion it has everything to do with interest and motivation. I'm much more inclined to do a film project because it brings me happiness while also engaging me and helping me receive good grades. When I look at a math assignment I'm nowhere near motivated to do it, which in turn brings down my mood and my grade because I don't put my all into the subject. Therefore I don't take in any of the information, whereas in my film class I could write you a paper on everything that we've learned since day one. Such is true for a majority of students; where interest and enjoyment peaks, so does information intake.\n \n If you ask the average student what their favorite time of year is, they'll probably answer summer. No school, warm weather, free time, fun. But when there's a project lingering over their head that they have no choice over and no interest in, it can really throw a wrench in their mood and plans. An unhappy student brews an unhappy school year, and I'm sure no teachers want that. Upon talking with many of my peers, I've come to realize that a summer assignment with no choice and no fun involved immediately creates resentment and a general dislike towards the class and the teacher involved. If students are obligated to do an boring project where the teacher has put strict guidelines, they're going to walk into the class with a preconceived notion of a boring, uninteresting course. This is going to weaken classroom morale and overall diminish scores and productivity in the classroom. However, if students are able to create their own project and do something their passionate about in relation to a course they're taking, it will ultimately make them excited to be in the class and increase their ability to succeed. I remember in my chemistry class last year, I was able to make videos for my labs. It made me excited every day to attend my science class and increased my desire to learn about chemistry. With choice comes happiness, with a happy summer comes a happy new school year.\n \n When it comes to summer projects and assignments, choice is always the route to follow. With a student-created project, students are more driven, ascertain more information, and overall have a better summer, which leads to a better school year. By comparing grades from class to class, paper to paper, or even just asking a student, it's not hard to conclude that with the ability to choose comes success in school.Â",

      "Obtaining a strong and rich education is a very valuable thing that many children across the world have access to. The school year can be very stressful due to a variety of different things, but summer is the gem that motivates many students to move forward. This three month break gives students an opportunity to prepare for the next school year, but the rate of learning during this time decreases. In order to continue a learning at a constant rate, schools have introduced summer projects. These summer projects can be designed by teachers who are interested, but can also be designed by students. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it encourages teamwork and spurs motivation.\n \n Learning how to work with other individuals is an extremely important quality. A student-designed summer project will encourage kids to communicate with one another in order to satisfy the project requests of the students as a whole. Also, communication can spur relationships and bonding among individuals. Working with others and using teamwork to achieve a certain goal creates unity. Next, teamwork is not only seen in school, but also seen in the workplace. As adults, knowing how to work together and have good communication skills with others can make ones work atmosphere more enjoyable. For example: doctors have to work together everyday to save others through sharing their knowledge and conversing with one another. Lastly, teamwork can create a decrease in social anxiety and an increase in social skills. Many students experience social anxiety while meeting new people and having conversations with others. Although anxiety can not be fully defeated, teamwork helps push kids with social anxiety to make new friends and bonds. Having students design a summer project results in more unity among the student body, social structure, and life skills for the future.\n \n Summer is a very popular time of year that is beloved by many people, especially kids. A student-designed summer project makes the perception of schoolwork in the summer more enjoyable. Having fun while doing something increases the likelihood of continuing the behavior. If a student enjoys the project they are working on, they are more likely to complete it and submit quality work. On the other hand, if the project was teacher-designed, students would most likely find the topic boring, procrastinate, and submit a poor project. A student-designed project assures that it is a topic students find fun and is more enjoyable when compared to a topic selected by a teacher. Next, having students pick their own topic also holds them more accountable to complete their work without complaints. Students who tend to procrastinate may be more motivated to complete a project that they enjoy. An enjoyable project will motivate students to do well and will not decrease the level of happinessÂ they have throughout theÂ summer.\n \n The brain is an endless archive of knowledge and memories that is always eager to learn more. Actively learning throughout the summer increases education and pushes children further on the path to success. A student-designed summer project results in the formation of unity among the student body and creates a structured work ethic.Â",

      'There is a concern that students come back to schoolÂ not being ready to learn. Matter of fact, according to\n \n Generic_City Times, 88% of students coming back from summer break are not mentally ready for school. Students and their families take vacations to free their mind off of school/work. Being off for three months for vacations/ free time, can be difficult for the students, as they come back to school. Students come back "rusty"Â orÂ not ready, because their mind is still set on having a good time with friends and not doing any homework. To solve this problem (of students not being ready for school), school boards are deciding to require summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question the school board is asking is, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be designed by the student because students will pick a topic of interest, will not get a topic that they don\'t like, and teachers may give students challenging projects students are not capable of doing.\n \n Picking your own topic for a summer project can lead to better grades. According to "Academic Awards", students achieved better grades when they work on a subject of choice. A student said at the awards, "When I got to write about Hockey, which is my favorite sport, I put so much effort and time into my paper. I loved to write about how great of a game Hockey is. I truly believe that if you are allowed to write about a topic that you have true passion for, it will lead to great success. This aspect does not only apply to school work, but also the real world." There have been many studies on how "doing the thing you love" will bring you great success. That same aspect goes with school, students learn and perform better when they are learning a subject of interest.\n \n Normally, students do not like the topic of research a teacher assigns. People who went through school know that we have always had projects/ papers that do not fit our interest. Students slack on this aspect because they do not have true passion into what they are writing (not interested) or learning. One student from Generic_School states, "My true passion was history, I loved to write about the challenges, wars, and new changes of the world. I was looking forward to writing papers about history because this is the topic that ultimately interested me, but when I had to write about a science paper, I had absolute no interest writing about it. I would make up excuses to myself on why I shouldn\'t write this paper." Teachers teach about mandatory subjects that are either boring or not interesting. If summer assigned projects are brought to the attention, then teachers should not give out their own idea of what the student has to complete.\n \n Not only do teachers pick uninteresting topics to research about, but they also pick topics that may be to challenging for the writer to complete. Teachers give out topics of study that are challenging for the student to learn about and can bring a student down (not wanting to complete the assignment). A student from Generic_City said, "If I got a paper that was teacher-designed and difficult, I would not be up to do it. We already had to go through a whole school year doing what they teacher wanted us to do, why can\'t we choose our own topic for the summer?" If a student gets a topic from a teacher that is to hard for them to achieve during summer, then they will procrastinate to finish it. Teachers have the whole school year to give out challenging projects to students, but for summer projects, a student should not be assigned hard and rigorous work.\n \n Students should design their own summer projects because they will value their project more, won\'t get a bad topic (get to choose own topic), and don\'t have to deal with challenging topics teachers hand out. There have been many factors that have been in place to deal with students not coming mentally prepared on the first day of school. Should summer be shortened? Should schools give out homework for students to complete during the summer, so learning will be longer lasting? At the end of the day, no matter what the belief is about school work being done over the summer, student should be able to design and apply their own project.Â',

      "Most students don't enjoy getting projects assigned to them to complete over summer break. If students got the opportunity to design their own projects, it may be a more enjoyable experience for the student. Students tend to forget information they've learned during the school year once summer hits. A way a number of schools attempt to prevent this situation is simply assign projects for students to complete over break. Students should have the choice to design their own projects for summer break because they are more likely to complete a project on a topic they enjoy and they will have better time management.\n \n There is a higher chance of students completing an assignment if they enjoy the topic the assignment is based on. When trying to complete a project students have no interest in, often times the motivation factor runs low. Low motivation tends to lead to unfinished projects. There is a greater chance students will complete a project they've self-designed because they will most likely be more interested and better engaged in the topic they have chosen for themselves. For example, like reading a book, a person that does not enjoy reading has a higher chance of enjoying a book if it is based upon a topic they are interested in.\n \n With a self-designed project, students will obtain better time management. During the summer, many students tend to have a packed schedule. Therefore, causes students to not make time for projects assigned to them. Leading to why having students create their own project, follows with the task of the project being completed. Better time management has a great chance of leading to a completed project. For example, a student that is joyful about an assignment they have toÂ complete, will make time for the project. Students then will have no excuse on why they couldÂ notÂ complete their projects because they have the ability to design it in a way that fits their schedule.\n \n Overall, many students don't enjoy getting assigned projects to complete over summer break.

      "Summer projects are a great way to keep students learning over the summer. Some students may find them tedious, but they are actually very beneficial by keeping the students' minds working over their extended break. But, when teachers assign such projects, sometimesÂ they are not interesting nor engaging for the students. Thus, the interesting projects over summer break should be based on the student's interest in a subject, and not determined by a teacher, who may choose a topic that the student is not interested in.\n \n Often times during the school year, students take classes on subjects which they are not interested in in order to improve their college applications; this should not be the case for summer projects. The summer is a time for students to take a break from the rigorous math and English classes they took during the school year, and relax and do the things that they love. Therefore, to keep students engaged in their summer projects, they should determine what sort of work they do. For example, a person who has read all of the Percy Jackson novels would be very interested to learn about the classic Greek myths, and would greatly enjoy their spending a portion of their summer break reading Greek mythology. But if their English teacher assigned them a reading about the plight of the Native Americans, the student would likely not do the project until the last week of summer break, and would not retain any information and would receive a poor grade to start off the new school year. It is essential that a student researches what they like, and not something that is forced upon them by a previous teacher of theirs.\n \n At Generic_School, ninth-grade students were assigned a summer reading about the civil war, in which many students did not do, and thus started off the school year with a poor grade. They were not interested in the subject and thus did not want to waste a portion of their summer break doing something they do not enjoy. Some students did well on it, though, and that is where the issue is. An individual student would likely receive a grade for this project based on their interest in the subject, instead of their abilities as to do research and make a final product out of it. This is because those who were interested in the civil war or who had abundant previous knowledge of it would get a one-hundred percent on the project because they were either very interested in it or did not have to do any research to write the ESSAY. Those who were interested were motivated to learn about it and did lots of research. On the other hand, there were students who did not care for researching the Civil War as they did not find it interesting. Some of those students were the brightest in the class, and received a poor grade. The issue is that teacher-assigned summer projects cater to the interest of few, if any, of the students in a certain class, which causes grade discrepancies based on previous knowledge and interest, rather than ability to perform a task. Thus, if each student could choose their own topic to research over summer break and have the teacher approve it, there would be less unfair grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence.\n \n Research projects are of the utmost importance in the later stages of student life, thus students should learn how to write a good paper early on in their careers, and there is no better way to do that than to have them research a topic they are intrigued by. As previously mentioned, many students who were not interested by the topics assigned by teachers would often times not do the project or do the whole thing the night before school starts, and thus start the year off with a horrible grade. There is a more long-term effect of this issue, though. summer projects are not assigned solely for the purpose of learning the material, teachers also want students to learn how to research effectively and write good ESSAYs. In order to do this most effectively, though, the students must have an interest in the topic, and if their topic is their choice, they will pick one that peaks their interest and will most likely perform better on it compared to a topic which they did not choose. This will improve their ESSAY writing and research abilities in the future, and help create a more interested and intelligent student body.\n \n To conclude, students who are required to complete summer projects should be allowed to choose the topic they will research over the summer. Summer break is a time for relaxation and fun for students, thus when they must work it should be interesting, and allowing students to choose their own topics for research would make each individual more involved in their work. The issue with teacher assigned summer projects is that they cause grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence based on their previous knowledge of a subject. Grade discrepancies should derive from a student's ability to perform the task at hand, and not their previous knowledge or interest in the subject, and that is what happens with teacher-assigned summer projects. Finally, students develop research skills when they do well on a research project, and having students pick a topic interesting to them will increase their chances of doing well.",

      "Summer! Often described as a time to sit back and relax, a summer vacation can be seen as the antithesisÂ to any opportunity for learning. However, summer projects allow for learning to continue throughout the year. Summer projects should be student driven, due to the fact that they allow for self-motivation and individualism, as long as teachers are able to monitor the progress and quality of the work being done.\n \n A teacher-designed summer project does not allow for the same amount of individualism that could stem from a project designed by a student. Giving specific requirements for a summer project for an entire class of students will produce a number of cookie-cutter responses with no variety from student to student. This is because forcing students to fit into a mold limits any possible chance of self-expression. The entire point of creativity is to be outside of the norm, but that is impossible with a teacher-designed project, because 'the norm' is exactly what it is designed for.\n \n Furthermore, in a standard educational setting, students are not able to pick and choose what interests them, and this can lead to a lack of motivation during the normal school year. Finding a subject that one is passionate about is integral to continuing the joy of learning and of new discoveries that is so often lost in the later years of formal education. This is not anÂ issueÂ for student-designed summer projects.Â Allowing students to pick what interests them for a summer project would solve this issue. With no parameters set by teachers, the educational possibilities are endless for a student.\n \n However, regardless of how much a student is willing to learn on their own during summer vacation with a student-based project, teachers still have their place in this system. Checks and balances are necessary for any system like this to function, and summer projects are no different. Some parametersÂ for these summer projects should be set by teachers. Otherwise, there is no way to ensure that actual learning is taking place during what is supposed to be a learning experience. Teachers also need to have the ability to grade any given project, which would be difficult to do objectively if no parameters were given to the projects.\n \n Learning does not stop at the end of high school, and it certainly does not stop at the end of a school year. Student-designed projects allow for creativity and individualism from each and every student, and allowing teachers to have a guiding-but not controlling-hand in the projects can lead to fantastic academic results.Â",

      "Did you know the 75% of high school studentsÂ do their summer assignments in the last week of the summer. Some even do it in the first week of school. This percent would decrease if the students projects were self chosen. It would help them by giving them the choice of doing what they want to do. They would be able to be more creative, be able to do it faster so they can enjoy their summer and some families money is a struggle and they can't afford the teacher directed projects so they can do what works for them.\n \n When a project is student directed they have the freedom to do what they want and be creative with it and actually enjoy doing the project. I have had hundreds of projects in my eleven years of schooling and some of my favorite ones were in my cooking class last year. My favorite one in that class was a food truck project. My teacher said you have to make a cardboard box food truck, make a menu, and make one item on the menu. Otherwise we were free to do what we wanted. I ended up making some really good food because she said just do what you want. I alsoÂ ended up getting a good grade because I could be creative on that project.\n \n One major problem with summer assignments is that students either forget about them and don't do them or they pushÂ them off until the last minute. I am one of those students that procrastinates until the last minute to do my AP summer assignments. It makes it very challenging to do them when there is only one week in summer left and I want to have fun and enjoy the last parts of the summer. I have friends that are worse than me and either don't do the AP work at all or they do them at the beginning of the school year, but if they were self chosen they would not have the issue of not wanting to do them because they can do what ever they want and make it what they feel is good.\n \n My final reason is more on the extreme side but I have seen it happen. It is where the teachers summer work is a large project that is simple but costly and some families that I have seen do not have enough money to do the project. They normally end up failing the project because they never did the work, but if they could do what they want for it they could've passed. Where if they were short on money and it was limiting them on what they could do if they needed to they could do a less expensive project and save their money for other things.\n \n There are many other reasons that students should be able to do their own thing for their projects over the summer but here are just a few of the reasons that people say that they should remain teacher directed. It's that it is a lot easier for the teacher to grade based on what they are looking for because they can grade on their scale of how close it is to what they want. But when it is student choice they can be creative and have fun, the project can go faster and they can enjoy their summer for what is it and it can be more cost effective for the families that have lower incomes.",

    ESSAY:
      'Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.\n \n As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.\n \n However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will "slack off" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of "what is the effect of temperature on ice?" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.\n \n In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students\' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too "obvious" or easy.\n \n Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher. Students should be given every opportunity to learn on their own and explore their individual passions.Â Â Â Â',

    ESSAY:
      "Over the summer, many student spend their time doing nothing to keep their minds active and engaged in education. Many schools and teachers want children to continue creating learning experiences and mentally developing over the summer. One way they can do this is to assign a summer project for a student. While many of these projects might be created and outlined by the teacher, I personally think that Students should design and create their own individual projects because it would help them to grow as independent learners, it would allow them to create something that they would be enthusiastic about and would put more effort into. and it would also help the teacher see more clearly how effectively a student is progressing as a learner.\n \n One important reason that summer projects should be student designed is the fact that creating a whole project from scratch would help a child to become a far more independent learner, and would prepare them for their later stages in life. When a student reaches college, it would be pretty overwhelming for them to have to take a bunch of classes that were all almost completely independent if they had never been given the opportunity to grow in their independence as a person in middle or high school. A student designed project might be quite scary for many students, but I think that it is definitely necessary in order to be set up for long term success in their personal endeavors throughout their later years in education, as well as their career afterwards. Many jobs are highly independent and require for somebody to be diligent in their own efforts. For example, my dad is an engineer, and he has deadlines that are agreed on by him and the people that pay him for completing work for them, and if he doesnt meet a deadline, the client would most likely not be happy and never come back to get more work done from him.\n \n Another big reason that summer projects should be student made is that it would allow for students to be more creative, and work on something that they are very enthusiastic about, which would in turn make it easier for the student to work hard and do well on the project. If a student is assigned a topic that they completely hate, they would be extremely unenthusiastic about the project, and would definitely not want to work on it, especially during the summer months, when there are so many other things they would rather be doing. It would probably lead to procrastination on a project that would leave a student with not enough time to properly do the project to the best of their abilities. A project that a student is enthusiastic about could also lead to a student feeling confident in their abilities, and they would be encouraged to try their best and do well throughout the year to keep their positive momentum flowing.\n \n It would also be extremely helpful for a teacher to be able to see how a student is functioning and is progressing on their own terms. At the end of the day, the teachers job is to guide and lead us until we are independent enough to thrive on our own. If the projects were self designed, it would be an extremely helpful tool for future teachers to look back on and guage how much work a student needs on their independence journey before they can leave without facing struggle or uncertainty throughout their life. These self designed projects would help a teacher to clearly see each level of assistance needed by each and every student.\n \n All of these reasons that argue that projects should be student designed revolve around one thing: independence. I think that independence is the single most important thing that you have to prepare for in order to be ready for college. If a student was not independent in college, they would flounder around without being able to properly learn and develop the skills they need to succeed after college. Middle and High schools need to take steps towards challenging their students with independence to create self-sustaining, educated people that can truly help to make a positive difference throughout their communities and make the world a better place.",

      "Generic_Name\n \n Are take home projects for students over summer vacation necessary? Yes, students should be given some sort of summer project that corresponds with their class for the following year. students spend roughly eight months in school and once summer comes all the academic knowledge they acquired over the school year is lost the day they walk out the school doors. students should stay in some sort of school environment so they do not fall behind or lose as much prior knowledge about the subject. students could connect with their teachers for the next academic school year and receive their project from them, to turn in the first week of school.\n \n Many students need the extra summer project to keep them in the flow of things. Some students don't need the extra project they are always in a school mindset and keep there grades up. However, that is not the case for every individual student. A summer project would be no ones favorite summer activity but, it would benefit students for their next academic school year. therefore, students would already be in school mode and be more prepared and less likely to fail a semester due to lack of knowledge.\n \n Students should be able to come up with their own creative idea whether it be for a science project or an English ESSAY. Student would be more prone to do their work if they could do their own topic. Students would do topics that they are interested in, maybe a sport they play or the history of a vehicle they like. But, when students receive a prompt or a project of any kind they are not as interested as they could be if it was their own topic. The topics could be submitted to the students teachers to be approved prior to summer and starting the work.\n \n It is necessary for students to receive a take home project or ESSAY over the summer. It will keep students on their feet and in a school like environment. It will also build responsibility, and let your teachers know how dedicated you are to school or how important it is to you. Students would also have something to do over the summer, because most students sit around at home and do nothing but play video games and watch television. So yes, schools should send home summer projects and the students should be able to make a creative topic with his or her teachers approval.",

      "As the school year ends and summer break begins, many students cease to learn or do any education-related activities. Some schools require their students to complete summer projects to assure that the students continue to learn over the duration of their three-month summer break; however, there has been an ongoing debate on whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Those who disagree state that these summer projects should be designed by the teachers, but this not true. Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. One reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to demonstrate their ambiguity. For example, a student may have interests in a particular subject and may do a project that is displayed through an ambiguous media platform. That project format would not be able to be displayed if the projects were designed by the teachers. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to be creative with their projects. A student may want to be creative and show their ability to carve marble statues, or their ability to do ventriloquism. In another instance, a student may want to be creative with their project topic and may want to conduct research on a rarely known species of insects that they learned about while visiting South America during their summer vacation. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, students should be able to design their own projects because it allows students to learn more about a topic that interests them. A teacher designed project may inquire about a student's knowledge of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or Newton's Laws; however, these topics wouldn't interest many students and the amount of precision and thought put into the projects would be lackluster. By allowing a student to control their project's topic, the teachers are giving the students freedom to roam and think about what they are going to learn about.\n \n There are further reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. When a teacher allows a student to choose a topic for a project, it allows the teachers to understand a student's level of learning, as well as a student's level of thinking. Most students will be appreciative of the fact that they're able to conduct a project of their choice and will give their best effort while completing the project. As a teacher grades a student's project, that teacher is able to gauge what the student was thinking as they created their project. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that when a student is given the freedom to conduct their own research for a project topic, that student is able to give a demonstration of their innovation. Many students have strong innovation skills, but during the school year they are assigned different assignments that prohibit students from using their innovative nature. For example, if a student has an interest in airplanes, they may want to do a project pertaining to airplanes; teacher-designed projects would not allow a student to explore this area of innovation within themselves, which may cause them to lose interest in the topic. One more reason that the projects should be student-designed is that by conducting one's own research and designing one's own project, a student may explore new topics that may peak their interest. For example, while researching the hardships and difficulties of underwater welding, a student may learn about another profession that they did not know existed. This simple occurrence may sway a multitude of that student's life choices: which major they will pursue in college, which profession they may want to pursue after college, or if that student may still want to go to college after high school instead of going to a trade school.\n \n Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. Those who disagree state that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be teacher-designed, but there are a plethora of reasons that this is false. These projects should be student-designed for a multitude of reasons: students are able to be more creative and ambiguous when choosing their own project design, students are able to be more innovative when choosing their own project design, students are given the opportunity to learn about new topics, and when students are given the chance to design their own project, teachers are able to gauge students' thinking and cognitive skills levels. By allowing a student to design their own project, that student is bound to become a more independent thinker and innovator; thus, creating a brighter future for the generations to come.",

    ESSAY:
      "When summer finally begins, the last thing a student even considers thinking about is anything that is school related. The infamous summer project stands to change that. This topic, the summer project, coupled with my predetermined ideologies to what summer should represent lead me to the conclusion that if summer projects are to be a requirement for students, they should be designed by the student, for the student. The reasons students should have the right to design their own projects include, but are not limited to, the fact that giving students a say would let them express, and learn about, themselves creatively, the fact that students can make something they are passionate about, and the idea that summer is not a time to be doing school work.\n \n If students acquire the right to design their own summer projects, they would most likely make the project in a manner that would be both fun and educational at the same time. This is exactly what I did in the 10th grade, when I was assigned a video project in the class Driver's Education. I had never recorded a video for school purposes, and I never learned to edit either. The video project made learning to edit a necessity. I not only learned how to edit because of the video, but I also learned that making and editing videos can be extremely fun! It showed me that I love to make people laugh, and honestly, I may want to pursue making and editing videos one day. Students could choose a video project, or any other way to channel their creativity through this project. In doing so, in choosing how the project is designed, they may learn something new about themselves, and it gives students a chance to show, or maybe even find, their creative side.\n \n By giving students the right to design their own summer projects, you are giving students the chance to make something with the passions they have. This would have an extremely positive effect, as they would now be working on the project with an unconventional mindset, at least in the context of school work. This change in their mindset would make it easier for the project to be done, as the unique things each student loves are being incorporated. This would also drastically increase the quality of work, as they are doing something they love. Allowing students to incorporate their passions would also show teachers how each student is unique in their own way. Student designed summer projects may also create a new interest for whatever topic the project is on, as students would be more inclined to make a cocktail of their interests and school-related topics rather than isolating the two.\n \n Over the 10 months that make up the school year, students are in a constant state of stress, due in part by the work that they must do. Summer is a time for students to unwind, and to forget what it means to be a stressed out, overworked, and sleep deprived student. A time to relax. A time, for once in a student's life, to put the work, and the stress that comes with it, down for an extended period of time. If students are to be required to complete a summer project, they should, at the very least, have a choice in how they will design said project. As it will ease the sting of having to do school work in a time where no school work should be done in the first place. One may say, \"Anytime is a time to do school work!\" And while I see where they are coming from, school is out of session for a reason. Summer vacation is a time to be away from school and all of the psychological endeavors it brings with it. Which is why I know, definitively, that school work should not be issued out during the summer in the first place, and because of this, if school work is to be issued, the school, at the very least, should give the students the right to design their summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, students, without a shadow of a doubt, should be given the right to design their summer projects. Through designing their summer projects, students can learn about who they are creatively, they can incorporate what they are passionate about into the summer project, and finally, students can feel better about having to do a project during the summer, as they will at least have a choice in what that project is. All of these benefits are extremely valuable, as they will have a positive effect towards a student's life, as they can learn new things about themselves, and show people a bit of who they are. These positive effects would be an impossibility if the flexibility that comes from giving students the right to design their summer projects is not given in the first place. Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Most students try their best to avoid learning over the summer. As a result, they forget the knowledge they learned in the prior school year and aren't prepared for the upcoming school year. To get used to learning again, student's brains need to be refreshed and stimulated in the beginning of every school year.\n \n As an attempt to solve this problem, teachers assign summer projects. Students, often times, despise these projects because they are boring and stressful. However, these projects are neccessary because they ensure students don't forget about school. To make the projects more enjoyable for students, they should design the projects instead of teachers. Student-designed projects would be better because they focus on their interests, have higher quality, and be less stressful.\n \n In most cases, students don't find school work interesting because the topics aren't based around things students care about. Students get tired of learning about the same meaningless things that have no value in their lives. The things they are taught in school can't be applied to the real world and are based around a broken system that focuses on grades and memorization, not learing. Student-designed projects would focus on their interests. Students would actually want to learn compared to falling asleep in their history class listening to something that happened 900 years ago. Students could assign themselves a project based on a book they enjoy or a phenonom they find mysterious. Students would work and have fun doing it. The projects would still be educational and purposeful, but students wouldn't feel forced to do it.\n \n It is a known fact that if people love what they do, they will put more effort into it. When people don't enjoy their work, they don't care as much and don't try as hard. This concept can be applied to student-designed projects. For once, students would be excited to work and learn because they get the chance to do something their passionate about. Students would put more effort into their projects. As a result, their quality of work and overall project would be much better compared to if they had to work on a teacher-designed project. They would get higher grades and teachers would be impressed with their work.\n \n School is extremely stressful for students throughout the school year. The workload is intense and hard to manage. Teachers give difficult test and assign massive piles of homework that students have to complete for typically seven classes. Students feel pressure to attain good grades. This can lead to terrible sleep patterns, mental breakdowns, and anxiety attacks. Outside factors can also add to their stress. Students have to deal with their social and family problems, which can be emotionally traumatizing. Students also partake in clubs and sports or have jobs that just add to their workload. Summer is a much needed break for students because they can escape from the stress that the school year brings. On their break, the last thing students want is another stressful project. Student-designed projects would reduce their stress significantly. They wouldn't feel as much pressure to meet their teachers standards and would wouldn't procrastinate as much. Student-designed projects would encourage learning for students without incorporating the factor of stress that comes along with school work.\n \n Some might say that student-designed projects wouldn't focus on real topics or be taken seriously by the students. However, teachers could approve the designs to make sure they are educational. Teachers can also grade the projects like teacher-designed projects to make sure students don't blow the project off. Students will enjoy these projects much more because they can have fun with it. These projects will also help them learn over the summer break and prepare them for the school year. Student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects because they focus on the students interests, increase their quality of work, and take away stress. Student-designed summer break projects should be implemented into more school systems around America.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Many schools require students to do projects in the summer. These projects can be designed by teachers or students. The projects are created so the student can continue to learn over their break; but can become a problem if the student doesn't like the type of project given to them by the teacher. This is why students should be able to design their own projects. Students should be able to design their own project because they will be able to be more creative and comfortable; but teachers should design the project simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student when it comes to the topic.\n \n First, when students can design their own project, they will be more creative and will be more likely to show what they know. The student being more creative on their project will show that that they understand the topic and don't have to follow a simple and easy format. For example, personally, I have had summer projects like my \"Of mice of men\" book project that was just flat out boring and not fun because the teacher gave us no room to be creative in anyway. Many students want to be creative with their projects, but when the project doesn't look appealing or will not let us be creative, we don't get a very good chance to show what we know. Then compared to my personal reading book project, where I had the freedom of being able to be creative and could show my understanding of the book. It showed the difference between being able to designing your own project or being given a teacher designed, simple project.\n \n Furthermore, personally, when a teacher has given me a specific format; there is the feeling of uneasy because I feel if I don't follow the format, the project will be completely wrong. This example doesn't let the student feel comfortable and makes the student feel that they can't be creative in their own way. When a student gets the chance to design their own projects, the students will naturally be more comfortable. This can be shown by the students work and effort put into their projects. Being comfortable with a project for the students is a big deal because if the students don't feel comfortable, how will the students show what they have learned during their projects. A student designed project helps because it is based off of what they want to do and not something they were given.\n \n Although, when the teachers design the projects, the teachers will know more on the topic rather than the students. This can make it to where the teachers specifically designs the projects to the topic of choice. Since the teachers design the projects, they can create and use different kinds of formats. The teachers can also choose the type of projects the students can use. This can and will give the students more options on their projects than just one, and the students can choose the type of projects based on their strengths and weaknesses. Since the teachers know more on the topic of the projects they can use that to be creative themselves by designing a project for the students that isn't something most of the students have seen before.\n \n In conclusion, since many schools require students to do projects over the course of summer. Students should be able to design their own projects based off of them being able to be more creative and being more comfortable; but teachers should design the projects simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student on the topic. Work shows when a student is comfortable with their project. When they're comfortable the can aslo become more creative. After all of these statements and supporting evidence this is why students should be able to design their own summer projects.",

      "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed to keep it simple. Teacher-designed projects are usually time consuming, boring, and complicated. The summer projects should be fun, easy, and less time consuming for students. Students wouldn't want to do a project that could take up their entire summer break; they don't deserve it. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are able to decide how much time they want to spend on it and how easy or creative they want it to be.\n \n Summer break is the time students are off from school. If they were to have teacher-designed projects, it'll make them feel like their still in school. Students are supposed to enjoy summer break, not be focused on a project given by a teacher that could stress them out. Most times, students don't do the project at all for reasons like: \" Oh it's boring\", \" I didn't have time\", \" I couldn't understand it\", or \" It's too much work\". Teacher-designed projects are not right for students, especially since it's over the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects will allow students to have an enjoyable summer. If they create their own project, they have control on what they do. Students will still be learning by themselves with what they decide to create. If the student does not want to spend the whole summer working on the project, it will be okay because they're the one making the decisions. The students can make their project easy and fun with things like: Colors, Pictures, and Glitter. Students will be able to enjoy their summer break because their project will be fun and easy for them.\n \n Everyone has their own opinion for these two choices. If it were to be discussed by teachers only, they would most likely choose teacher-designed projects. If it were to be discussedÂ by students only, they would most definitely choose students-designed projects. Between teachers and students discussing it, it would basically be a 50/50, but the teachers should really give students the chance to create something and learn on their own.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects as a way to make sure they are still learning during their time off. To some students this sounds not ideal because if their getting a break from school then why would they want still be responsible for school work. While others may like keeping their mind stimulated while they are on break. Even in both cases the projects being required should be able to be student-designedÂ projects. Most students like having a choice of assignments or work so they can pick whats best suited for them and their strengths. The student-design offers more to the student then the teacher-design because the students are the ones who have the greater idea on what they are doing. Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety.\n \n Being interested in a particular subject or idea would most likely increase the effort and time you put in to what pertains to the subject. Even thought its during the summer more students would completeÂ a assignment that appeals to their interests rather then a standard project that teachers have assigned for years. For example if a student who likes Rap or Hip-Hop music is assigned to a research paper about all the major wars that the United States fought in they might not feel an appeal to do the project or at least not put in a lotÂ of effort in ; if that same student was allowed to research the same topic but create is own song or rap about it would increase the interest about the project and the effort put in. There would be guidelines and rules about how the student can complete the assignment and the subject matter but as a overall the project would be student design based. Although some students might not have a preference on any type of assignment or if the teacher assigns everyone one universal project most would use their interest to create a project they would enjoy doing. Letting student summer projects be student-design would increase the interest in the project.\n \n Students are going to to what they want in most cases so making the summer projects student design based will help have larger completion rate of projects. If what a student is being told to do is not something they agree with they will most likely not do it or turn it in or halfway complete it so it is not to its full potential. However if a choice is given or if the project is student design based it will more likely get done and done well. As an example if the teacher design based project was a four page paper then more then likely people are not going to do it because writing is not their personal strong suit, but if their was a choice of a four minute video project about the same same topic it gives student who have different abilities to excel just as much as others in their own personal way. While the student design will increase the amount of students who do the project their will always be students who just don't do it but at least for the students who do it,Â a bigger outlet is givenÂ so they can complete it in a way they they can understand or what they excel in. The student design gives student a bigger window so it can help them complete the assignment and have it done well.\n \n Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety. The projects assigned are ultimately for the benefit of the student in the long run so having the assignment be student based would greater benefit the student. Some think that since the teachers are mastered in their subject matter it should be a teacher design based project but then the student might feel smothered or boxed in by how they feel about the whole project in general which would be doingÂ the opposite of benefiting the student. A student design based project would be the best way for the student so succeed.Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "School is stressful. Not only during the school year but now during the summer. From extracurricular activities to preparing for the upcoming year, the summer can also be a time of stress. Students from all over America are forced to participate in summer projects designed to reinforce the information they learned during the school year. While this idea makes perfect sense, one must evaluate how these projects are designed. Summer projects should be student designed because this can improve creativity and eliminate stress; although one could argue that eliminating structure would result in a poor learning opportunity, teachers must think positively about every student's potential.\n \n In school, almost every project is teacher-designed. This occurs so that teachers can assess a set of skills a student can perform. However, implementing a student-designed project would help students find their true passion in a field and help them become more creative individuals. For instance, when a student is forced to create a science experiment on a specific wild plant, there is no creativity involved in selecting what to study. However, if a student could choose which plant to study and what experiment to do, it could improve a student's creative thinking skills. This student-designed project would also help students find their passion for science by having them discover a plant that truly interests them. Summer projects should be student-designed because of the increased creativity and innovation when students can choose what to study.\n \n Nowadays, stress is apparent with almost every student. The stress of pleasing teachers is often what forces students into a hatred towards school. When a teacher designs a project for a student to complete, it can turn a potentially fun learning opportunity into a dreadful and stressful assignment. For instance, if a student is forced to complete a history project on Abraham Lincoln, a student may see this as just another thing to be completed. However, if a student is given the opportunity to complete a history project on any president, he/she may find it entertaining to research one of their favorite people in history. This can greatly benefit the student because many students learn best when they are not stressed out about a specific goal. The lack of stress causes them to have a relaxed time while still obtaining valuable knowledge.\n \n While summer projects are valuable to ensure that students have retained information, they should not be teacher-designed. The summer should be a time where students can choose what to work on in order for them to truly find their passion. This can help to improve a student's creativity by allowing them to participate in an activity they are truly interested in. Similarly, this can help a student to eliminate stress by finding enjoyment in their project.Â",

      "Summer is a time for students to take the stress off of school and to have fun with their friends. Some schools think kids should still have projects throughout the summer to continue their learning. Each school is different, some schools have the teachers come up with the project, while others lets the students make it. Schools should have teacher-designed projects for the summer because it would get students ready for what they will learn that year, teachers could count it as a grade once school starts, and it would be an easy project that would not take too long to do.\n \n If a teachers got to come up with the project they make it on the one of the topics the students would learn that year. They know what they will be teaching, so they would make the projects on specific units to prepare you for the class. Doing this is great because it will get the students ready and interested into the subject early on. This will help the students for when they start school they will already know a littleÂ about the topic. The more students know to start with the better they might do in the class.\n \n Another great thing is if the teacher designed the project, then they could count the project as a grade to get the school year started. This is good because right off the bat the student could have a good grade if they do the project correctly. Knowing this more people, for sure, would do the project. Starting the year off with a good grade can help benefit you later on, if you start to struggle a little bit. The project would be easy, so it would be easy to get a good grade, which is a great way to start a school year with. The more students doing the project, the more students you will have thinking and getting involved in school during the summer.\n \n The teachers would make it a fairly easy project that would not take the whole summer to do. Summer is the teachers vacations as well, and they know as much as the kids do that they want to relax. Lots of kids travel and hangout with friends during summer and teachers know that, so they would make it a pretty fair and easy project. Doing projects like these kids get more involved and excited to do them. If teachers did a simple, and maybe even a little fun, project it would keep the kids thinking and yet not stressed out.\n \n Some might say that the students should design the project. They think this because they say the students could make it their own and they would be more interested if they got to choice what they wanted to do. Although some people say that, if a student got to choice their topic or how they want to do their project they would do it too easy for themselves. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers because it would be on a subject they will learn later that year, the teachers could count it as a grade, and they would make it a simple and fun project to do. Everyone benefits more if the teachers made the projects rather than the students.Â",

      "Imagine summer break coming to an end you would want to make memories with friends and family, but you can't because you have to do your summer project. When it comes to summer assignments many students will put it off until the last moment. They will do this for a number of reasons maybe they were on vacation, had trouble with their family, or just didn't like the assignment. Regardless of the reason in the last moments of summer they must rush to complete this assignment for the next school year. Summer projects should be student-designed because of students interest, schedules, and emotional health.\n \n Summer assignments should be student-designed because of different students interest. Some students may be interested in math while others might like scienceÂ or history more. If a student likes math but is required to do a history summer assignment they will not want to do it because they are not motivated to do something they do not like. Some may say that regardless of what classes students like they will do the assignment anyways because they have to. While that is true it would be better to let the students choose what they want instead of trying to force them to continue learning over summer break.\n \n Students schedules are not always as simple as teachers think so giving a lot of work to do over the summer might not be best for them. Students have a lot going on in their daily lives spending time with friends, sports, religion, and family emergencies. These are some things that constantly impact students lives on a daily basis, and if they are dealing with a lot over the summer they might have difficulties finding time to do the assignments teachers give them. Although most students have a lot going on so it not a valid reason for students to put off their work or not do it. However students know their schedule better than teachers they could design a project that they could fit into their schedules and complete on time.\n \n Students in their teens or lower are often feeling many emotions through the year but teachers probably don't think about that as they assign summer projects. A student getting a projectÂ they don't think they can handle while they are dealing with a lot at home could push them to make a bad decision like doing drugs or getting in a fight. Students could be feeling stressed, angry, or sad and getting an assignment they might not think they can handle could make them act out in unpredictable ways. Some may say that getting a project has no impact on a students emotion health. However the fact is all students have different conditions that they live or grew up in so when teachers assign projects they can't assume that all students are fine. If students could chose their own summer assignments they could chose something that would not feel so overwhelming to them.\n \n The whole point of summer break is so students get a chance to relax and prepare themselves for the next school year. While it is important for students to do a little work so they don't forget what they have learned so far, teachers should not force the work on them and they should not feel like it is too much to handle. In the past teachers designed the summer projects and students just had to deal with it but that system is flawed. Does it really help students review what they have already learned? What's to stop them from copying the assignment from a friend. Going forward students should have the choice to design their own summer project with the help of a teacher. While it is best for them to feel comfortable and want to keep learning over the summer teachers need to make sure that it covers the right material and that it is not too easy.",

    ESSAY:
      "Since the birth of the internet and social media, the world has shifted to greatly favor the innovators and the free-thinkers. Society no longer demands students to find one subject they are good at, go to college to study that subject, and then get a middle class job in that field. While performing one skill at a very high level still holds value, the most successful people are those who can think ahead of the curve, those who can think of the next Amazon, the next Netflix, the next Uber, the next big thing. So, how does that relate to whether we have student-designed or teacher-designed summer school projects? Well, letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. Instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another.\n \n Allowing students to design their own projects gives them far more freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could. Keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. Each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. That is why we need to give them tailored education. Giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. If we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long termÂ interest in. The freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them.\n \n Making students design their own projects encourages them to learn how to think creatively. Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively.\n \n When forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. For example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to collaborate together to design a project, designate jobs to each other, and hold each other accountable for their share of the work. That kind of collaboration never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. When students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like collaboration, because they won't have someone doing it for them. That is why it is important we take the time to prepare them for than now.\n \n A wise man once said, \"don't follow where the path may lead, but go where there is no path and leave a trail.\" I believe that quote perfectly represents how we want our students to think. The skills developed through out of the box thinking which can be achieved by allowing students the freedom to design their own projects is far more valuable out in the real world then anything the teacher could prepare.Â  Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer projects, as a student i'm not a big fan. But in the case of this argument, I don't have a preferred side. Either way these projects stress you out on a break made for not having stress. I will not say they are a good or a bad thing because there are so many pros and cons it'd be hard to really choose. But I guess I have to in order to pass.\n \n To start, I'm going to list some pros and cons of these projects then i'll pick a side. Lets start with pros. Summer projects, if done correctly provide some sort of education during the off school season. But usually when they are designed by teachers. Cons, there are a lot, and I have a student perspective so it makes sense. When a teacher makes the project, it requires me to actually use my brain. Summer projects takes time and energy from me. They take away time from my job that I could be out making money. So that is a pretty big con.\n \n Since I have to choose, If anyone was going to design the summer project it has to be the teacher. They understand the curriculumÂ and how to apply it to students. Yea, it'd be awesome if students did it. Then there would be a lot less work to it. Personally it's hard to think of a reason to where a student would want to design it other than personal benefit. I'm not saying that all students would do that. But a large majority would. Students wouldnt even know where to start. They would make up some fake assignment that would take like 10 minuets to complete. Which is great and all but there would be no information transmitted over the course of the summer.\n \n Honestly how can students design a project on information that they don't fully understand. That would be chaos. I understand why summer projects are in place. But if i'm going to be completely honest here, I don't want some kid designing what my task to do over the summer is. I see two things happening, that person will be my best friend or I'd hate their guts. There is not much more to be said in this argument. Hands down, with out a doubt teachers should design the summer projects.",

      "A student's life should be lived by a student's choice. While there are a select handful of students who yearn to increase their knowledge day in and day out at school, the majority despise it. Due to the lack of free time students are left with after their school day, weekends and breaks are their knights in shining armor that will save them from the prison they call school. One of the breaks most looked foward to is summer break. This three month halt in tests, note taking and projects is sheer paradise in the eyes of students. However, some deem it neccessary to continue the assigned curriculum into this break to ensure the adherence of crucial knowledge to the students' brain. With that being said, these summer projects should be devised in a manner that will benefit both the teacher and the student to the maximum. And so, to assure their continued learning during their break, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed in order to maximize productivity, to enhance their leadership skills and to allow for students to enjoy their project, and hence, giving them a break.\n \n The majority of students innately have a distaste for following directions and taking orders from higher authorities. As a result, when students are constantly ordered to work on numerous projects throughout the year, they will complete it with reluctance. Furthermore, their lack of desire to complete this project will lead to a lack of favorable content, meaning the students will not complete it to the best of their ability. While the teacher may need to put forth guidelines, in order to prevent the students intentionally procrastinating their assignment and turning in mediocre work, the students should be able to partially lead the prompt for the project. When the students are presented with a project they find interesting they will be eager to present their optimal work despite the activities they may be doing during the break.\n \n Taking leadership and making self-guided decisions are skills that students must acquire at an early age in order to succeed later on in life. Although the teacher may portray a leadership role in the classroom, it is quite difficult for the students to replicate the actions they see until they are given the chance. Allowing for students to make the decision on how they will plan their summer project gives them this chance. Simliar to a teacher constructing her lessons, with a student-designed summer project, the students will have to form an agenda based around curriculum and time provided in order to successfully complete it in due time. Ultimately, students will have to make decisions for themselves and organize their daily life giving them an advantage.\n \n Students grow rather lackidasical when dealing with a mundane routine back to back. During the school year, students spend eight to ten months being bombarded by the same tests and the same ESSAY prompts and the same book entries. Summer break, to them, is an escape from all of that pressure. Although it is neccessary to make sure that students retain the information they acquired that year, the students should be able to decide how the reestablishing of ideas and topics they learned. With guidelines and rules given by the teacher, the students can potentially produce work they are proud of and enjoyed working on.\n \n While it may seem rather bizarre to let students decide their own projects, the idea can be fruitful and beneficial for the students and teachers in the end. When the last bell rings for the year released them for summer break, the students bolt out of their school doors and practically forget all that they have learned. In order to prevent that, many teachers have implemented summer projects to assure the continued learning and retainment of their knowledge. However, during the summer when students are on vacation and living in paradise, the last matter they want to worry about is another project assigned by their teacher. Consequently, the students may potentially complete it without care to discard the thought of having work to do. This is ultimately counterintuative to the purpose of said projects. To fix this possible mishap, students should be able to design their projects with guidelines from their teacher so they enjoy the process of completing it while still enjoying their break, ehnace their organization and leadership skills and produce work to the best of their ability, With this method, the students can retain the information deemed neccessary by the teacher and the teacher is able to see this effort and productivity they put into it throughout the school year.",

      "Summer break for most students is a time when they can relax and enjoy a break from school and socialize with friends and family. While it may be in the students best interest to continue learning during the break while not in school, most times students are very reluctant to do their work if there is no in school motivation. If teachers insist on requiring students to complete a project over summer break they may receive better results if the project is student-designed. Having the students pick a teacher-approved topic that they are curious about would make them more interested in learning about their topic, give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.\n \n When students are interested in what they are learning about they pay more attention, and that is very important in the learning process. Letting the student decide what they get to research would not only motivate them, but keep them interested. For example, over the years I myself have been assigned homework over summer break, usually reading, and my classmates and I were much more inclined to complete the homework when the teachers let us choose what books we wanted to read, rather than forcing us to read something we didnt want to. This translates to almost any age of student, if they are given choices, they feel less forced to spend their summer break completing a project, and are more likely to complete the project.\n \n As most students know, homework is not enjoyable most of the time and we procrastinate until the last possible minute to get our schoolwork done, and most of the time when we do this the product is sub par. This is not because of the lack of intelligence, it is because of the lack if interest and effort. When students do not care about the work they are creating they will put very little effort into what they are doing. While if it is something that they are passionate about they will put much more time and effort into what they are doing. Say there is a student who loves to learn about plants and animals and how they live and survive, giving them a project on the Civil War would not interest them, and therefore they would produce a project created with little effort, bare minimum. If this same student was allowed to research plants and animals over the summer, their project would most likelyÂ be something they are proud of not only because of the effort that was put in, but because they would feel accomplished that they learned something new.\n \n When students enjoy learning it makes them more curious about learning new things. When Students are told what to learn and are kept uninterested, they begin to associateÂ learning with boredom. This can be detrimental for the the growth children, if they no longer want to learn. More times then not, when a student feels defeated, or unintelligent they give up, and that discourages them from learning in the future as well. While it is a teachers job to guide and teach the essential information in the curriculum, it is also their job to foster creativity and instill the love for learning within their students. Teaches giving students freedom of choice would not decrease the teachersÂ authority, it would simply give variety, especially during the summer when students are not particularly wanting to learn. A summer project where the student gets to pick their own topic would be a good opportunity to instill within them that learning can be fun and enjoyable.\n \n A teacher-approved Student-designed project over the summer would be the superior choice over a teacher-designed project. This would not only produce better results but produce better retainingÂ of the information that they learned, to be used in the following school year. Overall giving the students control over what they learn during the summer, would still assure that they are learning over their break while also keeping them interested in learning, allowing them to give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.Â",

      "In my own opinion, as a high school junior at Generic_School; to further your education during the summer, schools should allow student-lead projects to take place. The pros of allowing students to design their own tailored made educational projects out weigh the cons. When you are able to design your own educational project you put more heart into it, then if it was teacher-designed. That extra passion allows for students: to explore different interests, connect with colleges, explore research foundations, and to participate in community service.\n \n Nudged deep in every student thoughts, especially teenagers,Â is the fact that college is right around the corner. Allowing students to use creativity to there advantage, instead of being left in a box doing a research paper. Gives them a positive opportunity to explore different careers and the majors attached to them. Lets say for a thought exercise, that a high school junior named Generic_Name is going to college, but sadly doesn't know what he's interested in. A student led project, gives him the perfect opportunity to pursue different career fields, to find out what excites him. By the time he graduates from high school, Generic_Name already has a generalized idea of what he wants to major in.\n \n Asking questions is essential in helping to find the right college or university. Creating a student-project for the summer, allows students to connect with both research foundations and professors at different colleges; enabling students to network earlier not later. To better explain my thinking behind this, think for a minute that your Generic_Name, and your doing a project on DNA. By contacting college level professors and other professionals in that field, you not only helped yourself by getting an A on your report, but by networking; when your ready to apply to college and the professors already know you, your chances for getting in just doubled. As a bonus when Generic_Name is looking to get a job or internship; by already knowing professionals in the field, he's more than likely to get his desired position.\n \n With passion comes community service, it's a saying I like to say, time to time. It works like an equation: passion plus creative project, equals community service. The more excitement that you have for a project, especially if you thought of it yourself, puts students in an unique position to voluntary get downed into the trenches of learning. When your learning, you often make the community better than how you left it in the summer. For an example, I recently met a young college grad named Generic_Name; he told me that in high school, his history teacher told him that a team of archaeologists needed volunteers to map an old Civil War battlefield. Sadly though he couldn't, because his English teacher over the summer made him write a mandatory research ESSAY on Jane Austen.\n \n All in all, students should be in charge of there own educational projects during the summer. It's like the old saying, you attract more with honey then with vinegar. Connecting it to a real world application, allowing someone to think rather then to be given; encourages someone to use passion, educate themselves, and put there heart into it, rather then sigh. Plus it's the summer, who wants to read a boring book from the eighteen hundreds! Â Â",

It can apply to here as well, students can learn what they are doing and use their learning to see how things are able to do what they do.

Since a lot of schools do require a summer project for students so they will have some type of work to do over the summer, it is much better for the teacher to create the summer project. Teachers are trained to give work they know is somewhat suitable for the students. For that reason projects should be teachers designed because they know what type of work to give their students, they usually would not assign something outlandish, they also would not make it as easy as the students will make it be.\n \n Some may argue that students will challenge themselves and not make it easy. People may also say that some teachers assign are a little outlandish and could be very hard for them. some may also say that students have a lot of things to do over the summer like jobs and sports and maybe even both. But not every student has those responsibilities and the others who do should find a little bit of time for their projects. Next, a reason for why teachers should design projects are because teachers know what type of project to design for the students\n \n First reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers know what type of project to assign. Reason for that is because teachers most likely having been assigning projects for years know what type of projects may be to hard or maybe to easy for some students. Most teachers by the time it teachers summer will have a good understanding of what some students can do and can not do, and they know if they should make it challenging or make it somewhat easy. Teachers will try their best to not make the projects too hard for the students to complete for example a teacher would not tell their students to read like say ten books and then summarize them, reason being is because they know not every student has the time to complete it if they have other things going on in their lives. Secondly, teachers wold not assign something that seemed very outlandish or bizarre.\n \n Secondly, teachers would not assign a project that was outlandish and bizarre. Like for example a teacher would not tell you to writeÂ 5 full ESSAYs in MLA style have it hand written and also typed. Reason for that is because even though summer may seem long it can actually go by very quickly and many students have things to do over that period of time. For example a student may have a sport that has practice everyday or may have a job that requires them to work everyday. With that in mind teachers would make it challenging but will try to not make the projects very outlandish. Another reason for why teachers would not assign a bizarre project could also be that not all teachers want to grade a lot of papers. For example if they were to assign something like a few ESSAYs and a reading project all the grading they would have to do is much greater than the work the students had to do, just because their are a lot of students who may have done the work. In addition to teachers making the projects outlandish and bizarre they would also not make the project as easy as the students might make them.\n \n Lastly summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would not make the projects as easy as the students may make them. Students usually like to not do anything over summer because they think of it as their break from work and projects, so if the school allowed the students to make them the students might make it very easy so they do not have to do much. Students would take advantage of them being able to make their own projects for example, students may make a a easy project like read a comic book or something like that and not do that much. The teacher however will make it somewhat challenging like for example they will assign a project that would not be very easy but will make it somewhat hard. Not all students will make it easy their are some students who will challenge themselves to do good and make a good project. But it would be better and more efficient if the teacher were to design it. Lastly, in all it would be more efficient if the teacher were to design the summer project\n \n In conclusion teachers should design the summer reading project because they know what to assign to their students, they not gonna make it outlandish or bizarre, they are also not gonna make it as easy as the students might make it. Teachers get paid to each students so it would make sense if the teachers would assign the summer projects because they know what type of assignments to give for the students. After all of this is done i want you to,look back and realize why teacher should make the summer projects and why students should not be able to. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Do you really think student's would like to complete summer projects over the summer? Me personally i would hate to even think about having some type of extra work in the summer, why? well here are my three reasons. I know sometimes in the summer, were bored and can't wait to start school. Secondly there's times where we want summer to hurry up and come around, because were drained mentally, physically, and emotionally because of the thought, we have work to finish up, make sure you turn it in on time before the due date and focus on maintaining to keep your grades looking good and not disappointing,. Thirdly, no teacher nor student would like to do a summer project over the summer.\n \n Although, in the summer, were sometimes bored and can't wait to see are friends so were excited for school to start back up and hang out with are fellow peers. Because i know some people can't go out, hang out with friends because their parents are too stricked; or they're furious about letting their kids out at a certain time even though they can have a bed time but some parent's just can't risk anything i'm talking out of experience because my parent's are like that, it's not fun at all. But honestly you'll thank them later on as you get older or when you have kids because, how society now days is set up is crazy! , i tell you.\n \n Then, we started school, for example \"September 4, 2019\" is the first day we enrolled in school then give it a few months into the school year \"January 11, 2020\". let me tell you, the first day of school was memorable, seeing the pleasant faces of missed friends and teachers was probably the best, but as soon you get later into the year it's not so jolly anymore, your're DRAINED the feeling that you just want to drop out, give up, you dress like you don't love yourself because of the amount of stress on school work, the end of year state test's, so you can't help but to say \"I can't wait for summer\" out of your mouth. You feel so relived when the word \"summer\" comes out, you start thinking about all the things you can't wait to do.\n \n After, when you are finished with school, who wants to go home and wants to start on a summer project?? most defiantly not the teachers nor the students, we have been learning for months and i know teachers are sick, tired and cant wait to catch a break, don't get me wrong we need to gain knowledge everyday but after all the months we've been learning and teachers staying after to grade our papers and assign are next assignment when we come in class is a call, a call that we need a break.\n \n To sum it all up. The moral of the story is no, no i don't think teacher's nor student's should be required to complete a summer project over the summer, it's too much for them and i'mÂ pretty sure their brain needs some type of break, you know? vise verse. I hope the schools that require this assignment should think about there decisionÂ a little more. Respectfully. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "The Sun is blazing, the sky is blue, and school is out. What more do students want? Once summer starts school books are thrown to the back of the closet, never to be seen until the next year. This worries schools since when students aren't learning during the summer then classes have to be provided for students to relearn everything they forgot. This led schools to develop summer projects so that their students will learn during the summer. However, issues started to arise of how they should be designed. Some say teachers should design it and others say that students should design it. Although teacher-designed summer projects would help set guidelines so that the students can learn as much as they can, student-designed projects will let the students showcases their creativity.\n \n When designing the summer projects, teachers most definitely would set guidelines for students to help them, when they get stuck. However, what teachers don't realize is that by setting guidelines they are really restricting the student's creativity. They are limiting what the students can do and for the students to get a good grade on the projects, they would base their entire project on those guidelines. Which would mean they aren't really learning. These set guidelines would correspond with the topics that the teacher assigns. The assigned topics would focus on the materials the students need the most help in. Which in reality is forcing the students to learn. When someone is forced to do something they aren't interested in doing, they wouldn't usually put their full effort in to completing that task. This is the same for students too. By forcing the students to do these projects and not letting them chose what topic to do, the students wouldn't put all their effort in the project. This represents that the students aren't actually learning. This would be theÂ oppositeÂ effect of what the summer projects were intended to do.\n \n If the students were to, however,Â design the projects instead, then the issue of them not learning would be avoided. By making the students design their own projects, they are able to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills. Most students, during school, have a difficult time demonstrating what creativity they have. However, by giving them this chance to design their own projects the students can really put their full heart into it since they would actually have interest in the topic. By being able to design their own projects students can also develop new skills, like leadership. Leadership is when someone is able to take charge in a difficult situation. The students would be able to represent this when they have to take charge to develop their own project based off the topic they chose. Having the ability to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills, students would be able to fully grasp what their learning. Schools then wouldn't have to worry about assigning classes so the students can relearn everything they forgot, since when school starts in the fall students would be ready to tackle new topics.\n \n When it comes to demonstrating why students should design their own projects, schools should look towards the science fair. The science fair is a student-designed project that every student has to do, at least once, in their high school or middle school life. The science fair makes students pick a topic that their experiment would be based off of. When picking the topic, the student is showcasing their creative side since they aren't restricted on what topic to pick. During the experiment process, students are able to develop research skills for when they have to write their background paper on their hypothesis. Since they would need to find respectedÂ articles that relate to theirÂ hypothesis.Â Students would also be developing their leadership skills since when doing their experiment things can go wrong and they have to take charge and figure out why. At the end of the science fair process, students can then really grasp the understanding of the scientific design process and how to develop a well done experiment. This would all be possible since the science fair is a student designed project. If the teacher were to design the project and pick the topics, students would have never been able to fully understand the scientific design process.\n \n Schools should make the summer projects student-designed since it allows students to showcase their creative side. Even if having them teacher-designed would help set guidelines the students can look back at when stuck. By having teachers design the projects, students are going to be restricted and aren't going to be able to really learn since they won't be putting all their effort into the project. This would all be avoided if students were to design the projects themselves, because they won't be restricted and instead they would put all their effort into the project. At the end, students would be developing new skills and getting to actually learn. A perfect example is the science fair, where students are made to design their own experiments so that they can understand the scientific design process and how to properly make a experiment. Schools should trust their own students for their own learning at certain times.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects range from all sorts of different styles and designs. Some people argue that these assignments should be teacher-designed so it is more detailed and challenging. Others argue that it should be student-designed so its better for the student. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it, students will be more passionate about it, and teacher-designed projects take away freedom.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it. People learn better when they do things themselves. If students have the ability to choose how to do their project, then they can learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn which makes student-designed projects the best way to learn. Furthermore, its helps students overcome obstacles. When students are doing their projects they will run into troubles. If the project is student-designed, they will have to overcome these obstacles themselves and help them grow academically. To sum it up, student-designed projects help students learn from mistakes and help them overcome obstacles.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be more passionate about it. Students will do their project if they can choose what its on. If students can choose the subject of the project they will be more likely to do it because they are interested in what it is about. If the project is something they do not care about, they will not complete the assignment. Students will have more fun doing the project. If students can choose the subject of the project they will likely choose something they are interested in. If the subject of the project is something the student enjoys, they will have a great time doing it. To sum it up, student-designed projects will encourage students to complete the assignments and students will have a good time doing it.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because teacher-designed projects takes away a student's freedom. Teacher's get to choose everything. Teacher's get to choose what assignments students receive throughout the whole school year. Students should get the chance to be free and choose what they want. Furthermore, Students should get the choice of how the project gets done. Students have to take time out of their vacation to complete their summer project. Since they're using their own time, they should at least get to decide how to do their project. To sum it up, student-designed projects give students the freedom to learn what they want to learn.\n \n Student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects because they help students learn better by making them overcome obstacles. Students are also more passionate about it and it gives them the freedom to do what they want. Students don't get the chance to choose many things, but summer projects should be something they get to complete the way they want.",

      "Spring break is lots of fun for students that are in school. Students get one or more weeks of school off to do what they want to do. During spring break there still should be some learning going on in the students spring break. Whether that be ESSAYs, projects, or book reading, students should be doing work through break. Some schools require students to complete projects during spring break week. Students should design the project that kid wants to do so they can remember it better and learn from what that student is saying and doing in that specific subject.\n \n First, students would benefit more from making their own projects from scratch. So many kids can not always comprehend what the teacher is teaching them so the kids try an put the knowledge into his or her own words. Teachers should not be responsible for how the students do the projects. Kids and teens that are in school can retain more information when him or her are doing the project based on what they think is right. Also, the students should be able to choose what the project that student is going to do because, the students are more likely to agree, be able to compare with that project, feel more connected with it, and interested.\n \n Second, learning during break is a good thing for students to do for themselves without the teacher present. If the kids put his or her own effort into doing a project without the teachers outlines, the students will be way more successful in learning and retaining the information those students have just done in the project. In some cases, having a student make up his or her own projects is a gigantic help to the grade and to the teachers. Students would benefit more from making the project something that student loves to do or a special hobby that kid has.\n \n Some may say that, a teacher designed project is better for the students. Students would be able to go back and reference what is supposed to be on the project that the teacher has given that person. However, student designed projects are better for the class. The kids will be willing and able to do a project thatÂ him or her want and desire to do.\n \n In conclusion, kids should design the project so that him or her can remember what that student is learning in class. Some students have a hard time grasping what the teacher is teaching them. The kids tend to learn more and pay more attention at home or somewhere other then school. Projects over spring break should be student designed.Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.\n \n Completing a summer project allows students to refocus more quickly when school starts again and ensures that skills students learned during the previous school year remain sharp.\n \n Additionally, the completion of a summer project provides for a phantasmagoria of success throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n However, most of these summer projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students learn differently, can explore their passion, and can show off their unique skill set.\n \n Obviously, students have different learning abilities and may learn differently from their peers.\n \n For example, students who are classified as auditory learners would not succeed on a hands-on project to continue their education because they prefer verbal explanations or videos to learn.\n \n Additionally, some students are visual learners; they may require to see another person's work in order to complete their own.\n \n Therefore, assigning these students a hands-on project would not be beneficial to their education.\n \n When different learning styles are taken into consideration, it is evident that each individual student is aware of how they learn; consequently, they should be able to devise a project that fits their unique learning style.\n \n Furthermore, assigning a student a project that does not interest them would make completing the project seemingly unbearable.\n \n Students would choose topics that interest them if given the chance to design their own project.\n \n For example, a student who is particularly interested in automobiles would not wish to complete a project on the effects of cow manure on the pollution of waterways.\n \n They, in turn, would not take this project seriously, which would be detrimental to their grade.\n \n Additionally, giving students the opportunity to design their own project would allow the teacher to see each student's passions.\n \n This would benefit both teacher and student because the teacher would learn about the student's interests on the first day of school rather than through awkward \"getting to know you\" activities.\n \n Giving students the ability to design their own projects would allow each student to be excited to explore their interests and present their passions to the classroom when school starts again.\n \n Some would say that allowing the students to design their own projects would cause an issue for the teacher to grade it because each student's project would be different.\n \n However, allowing students to design their own project would give them the ability to show off their specific set of skills.\n \n For example, students who are gifted in vocal music would not succeed on a project that involves woodworking, and vice versa.\n \n Students should be given the opportunity to share their gifts with the teacher so that future projects could be set to their strengths rather than their weaknesses.\n \n On the issue of grading these projects, teachers could evaluate the amount of time and effort that appears to be put into each project rather than using a cookie-cutter rubric.\n \n Students would be more successful on a project that showcases their skills than if a teacher designed the project for them.\n \n Grading these projects would simply take a more evaluative angle from the teacher.\n \n When one considers that students have individual learning needs, wish to complete projects based on their passions, and are more successful completing projects that emphasize their skill set, then one can see that students should be able to design their own summer project rather than complete one that is teacher-designed.\n \n Allowing students to design their own summer project would, consequently, prepare and excite them for the upcoming school year where they would be able to present findings that are unique.\n \n This would then build momentum for the remainder of the school year.\n \n Although projects would prove to be dampening to the students' summer break, completing a project that explores their interests would be less gruesome than a teacher-designed project.Â",

      "Summer break is for students to have fun and enjoy the long warm days, however, school requires for students to continue learning. The way they want you to continue your learning is by making projects. Schools want to know if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed.\n \n In my opinion if students are going to be required to make these projects they should at least be able to be student-designed. Since it's summer, students are not going to be pleased having to make a project espescially if its teacher-designed. If students were allowed to make the project their own way they would be able to make anything that involves what is going on with their summer break. They would have also more options and ideas than if the projects were to be teacher designed. Student's would have a greater chance doing extremely better if they went based on their own creatation.\n \n Students would maybe struggle a little because then again they are only students, so they wouldn't know if they did it right or if they have enough work done. If it were to be teacher-designed, student would have an idea of how much they would need to include. It would take longer but a student would know what the teacher is looking for and what they would consider a good grade. As a student myself i overthink a lot on the work i do on my own; i ask myself \" does this look right or is it missing something?\". Which leads me to try and making it better.\n \n Overall, i would prefer if the school would allow the projects to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. It would take less time if students had the choice to have our project made the way they think is best. Students work faster when given something to do on their own because it opens their mind up to more than one thing. Since the project is a requirement i feel as if it should be fun and made however students feel is right, this way they spend more timing doing it and getting the work done.\n \n In conclusion, students should be allowed to have the choice to make their summer project just the way they feel is right. Teacher-designed projects don't let a students be as creative as if they made it with their own ideas.",

      "Having a summer project to do may seem like a bad thing byt what if you got to choose the project you wanted to do or would you let the teacher choose, these summer projects should be givien by teachers.\n \n The teachers would know what projects and what to expects from certain kids. While knowing what kids she has she would not give the kids to mush work or to little work. Then from there on the teacher would give the right amount of work to the kids so they can still be ready for school but also have fun on their vacation. As of this choice is the students decide to do it or not it won't harm the teacher, but for the kids that do it they might have a extra credit put in or maybe even help them pass a class.\n \n More reasons for teachers to assign these projects would be, cause the have more time on their hands.\n \n Students get out before the teachers and teachers still have to work extra few days for planning for stuff. When they do this they can take some extra hours to make this project depening on the subjects they are doing and what they are doing it might take a while, but they can get it over as soon as possible. The teachers that already do summer programs could also help with making, creating, and grading the projects and the teachers would probably get it done in enough time for the student to finish\n \n While on the aother hand;, students may think that if they go tot plan it that it wouldbe alot better. Students wouldt attempt to probably cheat and get veryone the same project ao that they all can do it together.\n \n The kids would not take their own project that serious seeing that most kids barely take school seriously. Student would make short little projects about what they did for summer or something tghey wouldn't really pick something that would keep them educated out of school. They wouldn't really care about something they have a choice for they wouldn't taoke it serious. Teachers will get it done in enough times; on ther other hand the stiudents might not, also some students may have a different influence on other students but some may not so they might not like the projects that they get given to them by certain student. Students will listen to their own teachers but the only problem is will they do it.\n \n In conclusion, teachers should create these sumer projects instead of students cause they are actually going to make them educated and well-shared; while on the other hand students don't have the same influence as teachers.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer assignments are known to and disliked by every students that has had to complete these tedious tasks. Schools assign summer projects to assure that their students are still learning during their breaks. However, as you grow up the tasks that are assigned tend to shift from something that is teacher-designed to student-designed. Some people may say that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial to a students learning, because teachers know the material that should be learned and these project are easier to understand.Â However, they are wrong because student-designed projects have a lot more benefits that are necessary to a students learning and growth. Summer projects should be student-designed because they ensure that the subject of the assignment is relevant and interesting to the student and they teach them important skills.\n \n To begin, student-designed projects let students pick subjects that are most likely to benefit them. Teachers dont know what field every student wants to study in, and so they cant make a project that will be beneficial to everyone. For example, the most common summer assignment is to read a book and then write an ESSAY on what the student has learned, which helps kids in their reading and writing skills. However if a student wanted be a scientist, although this project would be somewhat useful, it wouldnt help them get closer to achieving their goals and dreams. On the other hand if the project would have been student-designed the future scientist could have chosen to conduct experiments or learn more about what interests them. Also, student-designed projects motivate kids to continue learning and so they wont lose interest. When a student picks their own assignment, they will be more likely to finish it and more than that they will actually want to finish the project. An example of this in a different context from my daily life is myself doing some cleaning. If my parents told me to clean, i will most likely put it off or do a sloppy job, because i didn't want to do it in the first place and at that point i am being pressured and forced to do the chore, but if i chose to do it on my own terms everything would get done in an orderly fashion. I feel like students use a similar mindset for completing project. If it was student-designed, they would be motivated to keep working and in the end they would produce better work. Some people may say that teacher-designed projects are better because, they focus on material that students should know for every career option, but they are wrong because what is important to learn in one field might not be as important to learn if they chose to pursue a job in another field.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects teach students very important life skills. It teaches them to be self-reliant. They have to come up with their own project and set out their own rules and criteria. They cant look back at the instructions and follow what the teacher said, and they cant ask specific question about how to do the project, because everyone has a different project specific to themselves. This type of project makes it necessary to think on their own and not get help or take short cuts from others. Learning how to problem solve and understand things on your own is something that will be crucial as an adult so it best to learn it at a young age. Also, self-projects help you stay organized. When you are doing something completely on your own, with your own ideas you cant lose or forget things because it is detrimental to your project. Unlike something that is assigned where you can just look back on the website or check the paper to find the answers, you have to keep track of everything yourself or else you wont have the answers. Lastly, student-designed projects help with time-management. During my personal project, since i had trips and activities planned during the summer, i had to set out a specific time lineÂ with goals that i wanted to have complete by each week. Before this project, I was very bad at completing tasks because i would always put it off until it was the very last minute. With this project, i was forced to do everything in a process or else i would fall behind. Students would not learn all these skills if everything was laid out by a teacher in a teacher-designed project.\n \n Although teacher-designed projects are easier to understand and the teacher know what material is important, student-designed projects are a lot more beneficial to every individual student. Having a student design their own summer project ensures that what they are choosing to learn is beneficial and interesting to them. It also teaches students life skills that are important for everyone to learn at a young age. The point of summer assignments are to keep the student learning even when they are out of school. I think if the main goal of the school was to have students just learn information during the summer, then a teach-designed project would be acceptable. However, if the schools wanted their students to not only learn but grow and develop as young adults, then havingÂ student-designed projects are the better options to go with.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "In today's world, the competition for higher education is ever increasing, with the requirements for test scores, GPA, and extracurricularsÂ growing exponentially each year. To help keep up with the competition and separate students from the general masses, some schools are beginning to require summer projects to ensure students are continuing to learn, even when out of school. While this practice is becoming more and more common, many schools are struggling to decide whether these projects should be assigned by the teacher or created by the students. Although some say that teachers should assign summer projects because they will be more suited to helping students learn, summer assignments should be student-designed because they will excite students to learn, be better suited for the students' lives, and encourage creativity.\n \n First, student-designed projects are superior because they inspire and excite students. In a learning environment, passion and excitement are paramount to student success. Often times when teachers assign projects and assignments, they have little regard for the interests of the students, causing the class to dread working on the assignment and putting it off until the last moment. Also, when students choose their own project, they can ensure they are relevant for their future plans. For example, if a student wanted to become a banker in the future, they could base their project around the world of economics instead of wasting their time on a project about the Civil War. All in all, student-designed projects would encourage success because students would be more invested in completing the projects and they would help them in their future careers.\n \n Additionally, student-designed projects benefit students because they are better suited for students' lives. In any given high school, there are students who live drastically different lives, from students who have to work two jobs to teens who have nothing but free time after school. Because of this vast diversity, not all students reap the same benefits from a teacher-designed project. If students were able to design their projects, they would create projects that work best with their schedule and do not cause any undue stress. In addition, some projects are not economically feasible for all students. As an example, if there was a teacher-designed project that required all students to build a robot out of costly circuit boards and 3-D printed materials, not all students would be able to afford the materials, causing them to take short cuts and hurt their grade. Student-designed projects would ensure that students can design an assignment that fits their budget and would help to close the disparity in success between wealthy and working class students. To conclude, student-designed projects benefit students because they ensure that the assignments fit in with students' busy schedules and tight budgets.\n \n Finally, student-designed projects help ensure out-of-school learning by helping to spur student creativity. When students are assigned a project by a teacher there is little abstract thought needed to complete the project, all they have to do is follow the teacher's directives and they will get an acceptable grade. When students create their own projects, however, they are forced to think deeply throughout the entire process, from formulating the topic to deciding upon the presentation methods. Also, student-created projects encourage creativity because it opens the door for the study of more abstract topics instead of the mundane, ordinary topics that teachers usually dwell on. For example, music is shown to increase creative thinking, so if a student wanted to learn about the French Revolution, they could create a topic like, \"The French Revolution and its effects on the Romantic music of the day,\" instead of an ordinary topic like, \"The effects of the French Revolution.\" In summary, student-created projects encourage learning by requiring students to use their creativity.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer assignments help students learn because they interest students, fit students' lives, and inspire creativity among teens. If schools began to implement student-designed summer projects, they would begin to see an increase in passion and preparedness come August when students go back to school. As a result of the increased drive shown by students, schools will also begin to see more and more students attending accredited, well-respected universities upon graduation. Schools must start allowing students to design their students to design summer projects, for it will create an educated, passionate, and happy school community.",

    ESSAY:
      "Many students and teachers argue over the question of whether or not students should be able to design their own summer break projects. There are mixed answers over the quality of the work, the amount of creativity that should be allowed in the school building, and how well this ensures students learn the material. Teacher led projects, however, take away all of the potential positive effects associated with those concerns. Summer projects should be student designed to increase creativity in students, make sure students know their classroom material well, and increase the quality and student interest of these projects.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity in students. When a teacher designs a project, it takes away the opportunity for the student to design and create their own representation of the assignment. When students get to choose their methodology of presentation, there are often more creative outcomes. For example, in an AP Government class at Generic_School, the students were given the opportunity to create a project on one of the departments of Congress. This led to numerous different types of projects: songs, raps, creative videos, etc. Had the teacher mandated they all do a PowerPoint (or other mode of presentation), the students would not have had nearly as much fun or been as informative in their projects. School should be about learning, but there should also be an element of creativity and expressing oneself in the classroom. Letting students design their own projects leads to much more creativity and student interest in the classroom.\n \n An additional reason that summer projects should be student designed are to ensure student comprehension of the topic. When a student has to generate their own mode of presentation, this ensures that they fully understand the classroom material, because the expectation in student designed projects is that students have to not only understand the material, but know it well enough that they can pick an appropriate way to present it to their peers. In the AP Government class, when the students were able to present their own projects to the class, many students agreed that they learned the material better than they would have if they had just done a generic presentation. It is common knowledge that when someone knows something really well, that they can teach it, and this kind of presentation enables the student to show exactly how much they know. Student designed projects make sure that students know their class information very well, and can teach it to their peers as a result.\n \n Some might argue that having a teacher designed project is better because when students are given the freedom to do their own project, the quality will not be as high. This, however, is not the case; although there are always counterexamples, the vast majority of students put more work into their presentation when given the opportunity to choose what it looks like. Referring back to the AP Government class, classroom presentations where students had the liberty to present how they chose were always of higher quality than projects where the teacher chose the mode of presenting. This is due to lack of interest in students; if a student is not interested in their project, they will not put as much effort while when students are given a creative outlet, they tend to put more of themselves into their work. Teacher designed projects are not the better of the two options due to their lack of freedom and decreased quality of work as a result.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity, ensure student comprehension, and increase the quality of their projects. When students are given the freedom to express themselves, it improves the learning environment and encourages more students to come to school. Teachers should be able to give their students more freedom in assignments such as summer projects.Â",

      "If I was to receive work for the summer break I would rather it be student designed work and not teacher designed work for many reasons. Theres the fact that if my work was designed by a student someone with a similar mindset as my own I would be able to understand it more clearly than if it was designed by a teacher. Plus theres the fact that student designed work has a possibility of being more simplistic, although teacher designed work is good for challenging the mind and stimulating brain cells im sure students would much rather enjoy there break much sooner. For example if your teacher gave you the choice to have the person to your left choose your summer project for you or have a five page ESSAY on a prompt she gave you which one would you rather do not that hard of a choice is it.\n \n One of the main reasons why I prefer work made by students over work made by teachers is because its easier to comprehend for those who have a harder time understanding more than others. With students making the work It would challenging without being to difficult to the point were it would consume a large amount of time to complete and not anytime to do anything during summer break. Unlike if you got an Teacher assigned project which could have the possibility to consume a large amount of time to complete. Like for example: if hypotheticaly speaking if the person to your left only give an assignment to write one to two paragraphs about a entire country and there culture or get an a your teacher gives you to write a four to five page ESSAY about the history of schoool and how it started.\n \n If I were to have a choice between simple work and complex work I would choose simple almost everytime because of one main reason is it takes less time to do. With the student designed work you would finish faster allowing you to have more free time to enjoy your summer break and relax away from school. Theres also the added benefit of getting more simple work done in a short time frame than you would complex work. I conclude this by saying that it would be more logical to have students design there own work for the summer break rather than have a teacher assign them some work for the summer break.",

      "Good morning Educators of Generic_City. Have you ever wanted your student, who seems to be disengaged or just not interested in class, to actually feel like they have a choice to make their learning experience more exciting? Then, maybe, you can consider this solution. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. As a student, I believe that students don't need summer projects ; it causes a high level a stress. However, if I had a choice then I would consider making summer projects student-designed. Teachers, this could quite literally be the answer to your prayers! Giving your student a chance to design their own summer project would give them a sense of independence that they need. Not only that, but I can guarantee that your student will have the desire to learn by the time summer break is over.\n \n It's not a surprise when students go to their teachers ; not knowing how to complete their assignments. Although, there is absolutely nothing wrong with students asking for help, but I know teachers get tired of repeating themselves. That is why giving students a student-designed project would increase their independence. Back in middle school ; when I went to Generic_School. My English teacher assigned a winter break project. The only requirement was to be creative. My English teacher had come to the conclusion that giving out a rubric would stress out the entire class. Since then, I've been more open to design my own projects. No more : \"How do you do this?\" or, \"Could you repeat that please?\" I am fully aware of what is needed to be done on my own. That independence is just the thing students need to succeed. Some may argue and say that giving students independence would only stunt their work performance. They could even say that students need that sense of reform. However, trying to reform your students would only be in vain. How are students going to fully understand if teachers don't give them the space to be independent? In fact, their work performance would gradually increase. Students take extra time to complete their assignments whenever they get up to ask their teacher a question. Now would you rather have your student waste their work time? Or, would you rather have your student independently do their work?\n \n It may be difficult to believe, but most students do enjoy coming to school to learn new material. If teachers want all of their students to be excited to learn something new ; they should consider how student-designed projects couldÂ possibly help. Its been proven, that half of the student population feel more engaged in a lesson when the have the artistic freedom. Students could write a song about Math, or maybe come up with their own screenplay about the evolution of rocks. Giving your students the power to designing their projects would, soon enough, catch their attention. Teachers could argue and say that it would only be a waste of time. It might be a waste of time, however, your students will feel more engaged with the subject. If you don't want your students to be interested in the lesson, then you might just lose everything you want your student to accomplish.\n \n Creativity is key in todayÂ day in age. Change is inevitable ; you can't hide from it. People desire to learn new things, but want to be creative when doing so. Teachers must be willing to change the way they want to teach their students. Students need a chance to prove that they are capable to be independent. Independence is one of the main things we, as people, try to achieve in the future.",

Finally Students might forget about and not do it at all.\n \n Teachers who design their projects for students knows how they want the students to do their assignment.\n \n Teachers that design their projects can be easier for students because they will know what to do and how to do it.\n \n Teachers that design the project can me more professional becasue students may make a mistake and not know what they missed and can look to see and fix it.\n \n Students who are busy during the summertime might be harder for them to come up with a projects on their own.

      "Many students would like to be the ones deciding what project they will do over the summer instead of having it assigned by a teacher. However they may not make wise decisions and they are very likely to choose the easy way out. Therefore, Students should not be allowed to design their summer projects because students will choose something that's too easy, students will procrastinate if they know it is their choice, and students will choose something they're already familiar with and will not learn anything new. Teachers need to assign these summer projects to ensure that students are having a positive and helpful learning experience over summer break.\n \n One reason students should not design their own summer projects is because they'll choose something that's far too easy for them. For example, If Generic_Name tells Generic_Name that he gets to decide what his summer project is, Generic_Name will be very happy because Generic_Name is a good teacher and probably would've given an assignment that he would consider \"too hard.\" Instead, Generic_Name will now go home and take 20 minutes to write about Spongebobs marine life and get an easy A. This will not benefit Generic_Name in any way, shape, or form because Generic_Name took 20 minutes out of 9 weeks to write about non-sense he knows will be an easy A. Therefore, teachers should assign projects in order to assure that students are actually putting their brains to work over the summer.\n \n Another reason students should not design their own summer projects is because many of them will go home thinking they have plenty of time to complete a simple project. This will lead to procrastination and many students will end up forgetting they had a project to do. For the students who procrastinate this will teach them bad habits and for the ones who forget and didn't do it, it will not benefit them at all. By letting students design their own projects in a 9 weeks time span, teachers are opening the doors to bad habits their students may learn. Therefore, teachers should assign these summer projects in order to keep students away from learning bad habits.\n \n In addition, students should not design their own summer projects because teachers know exactly what the students need to learn. The teacher should choose something important, that's not too easy, and that will help the students out in the long run. For example, If Generic_Name assigns Generic_Name to 3 ESSAYs about Oceanography , Generic_Name may not be happy, but it will help him a lot years down the road. When Generic_Name gets to 11th grade he will be an ESSAY master, he will get an A in English class, he will score a 600 on his writing SOL, and he will even be an excellent Oceanographer! Generic_Name will look back and be so grateful that Generic_Name gave him that assignment that he hated so much. Generic_Name will now realize that importance of having good projects assigned by qualified people. Teachers should assign summer projects to their classes in order to help them learn useful information that will help them throughout their lives.\n \n In conclusion, it is best to let teachers do their jobs and be the ones to decide on the summer projects. It is always interesting to see what different students choose for their projects, but the most beneficial to students would be the teacher-designed projects. For students it may not be fun but it is what's best for them and it will surely help them a lot more than the easy projects that they would have much rather chosen. Teacher-designed projects is the way to go!Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n By: Generic_Name\n \n Students are in school for 7 hours a day, 45 hours a week, 180 hours a month, and 180 days a year which is a very long time. Many schools in the United States require students to complete a project/assignment to assure that they keep learning over the summer. Students usually feel overwhelmed and stressed about these summer projects because of having to do assignments during their break. I believe that summer projects should be student designed because it allows students to freely choose a topic and not be stressed or worried throughout the whole summer.\n \n When students get assigned summer projects they usually ignore or not do them because the topic might be too boring, hard to do, takes a long time, etc. That's mainly because our teachers don't let them be student designed projects. Student designed projects are when the student gets to choose their own topic, do the work they want to do, and do everything based on what they want. Students hope that it could be student designed projects so it could take some weight off their shoulders and making it a topic they are comfortable with.\n \n Counter Claim: Summer projects should be teacher designed because not all students have great decision making abillities and don't have the skillset to do a project without the teachers help. If it were student designed then they would most definitly go off topic or show poor work and effort on the project. Teacher designed projects are when the teacher is in control. For example, they choose the topic, they choose what research you need to do, they choose if its an ESSAY or a presentation, etc. Teacher designed projects help students get ready for the upcoming school year and what they are gonna be learning in class.\n \n Student designed projects can help the students by learning how to do things on their own, help them gain amazing decision making skills, and gain experiences to help them later on in life. When the teacher's in control for everything then the student may lack in motivation or the will to even do the project. These projects can't help a student grow and learn if they are restricted to certain things that they can and can't do. Students should have the ability to do summer projects on their own with no stress and/or no restrictions.\n \n In sum, students get assigned projects or assignments to take home over the summer so that they could keep learning even during the break. Schools usually make these projects designed by the teacher(s). I believe that these projects should be student designed because summer is meant to be our break, we shouldn't have to have stress or anxiety because of these projects during our summer. Student designed projects can help us gain experiences as a student that we would never learn if they were teacher designed. They also help students feel that they are in control and it could help a student thrive to higher expectations.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "When someone says the word summer, people don't generally think about classrooms, or tardy bells, or chalkboards. Rather, about freedom from all of those things. Summer is a much needed break from the stressful conditions of school, however, whenever summer is ending and it's time to start heading back to school, students sometimes find themselves forgetting most of what they learned the year before. Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over the summer to ensure that they keep learning outside of the classroom, and to keep what they have learned the year before, fresh in their minds. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust.\n \n Summer is the time of year where students generally feel stress-free. There's no due dates, and no pressing homework. If these mandatory projects were teacher-designed, summer would feel more like school, and then students would have a bad connotation with the word summer. Sometimes people brush under the rug how stressful school can actually be to students, and summer is a much needed break. Though students do need to continue learning, it would be hard for a teacher to assign a project that fit everyone's specific needs and was appropriate for all students outside of the classroom. Summer break was installed for a reason, because if students go to school for 12 months, they'll more than likely get burnt out and will lose the motivation to learn. If students are allowed to design their own projects, they won't see it as school, but as fun.\n \n Students-no matter what age; kids, pre-teens, teenagers- haven't fully developed yet. They don't know who they are, or what they want, or what they believe in, because all they've known is their parents and the little bubble they live in for the first 18 years of their life. They try to find themselves everyday, they try to discover what their identity is. If students were able to design their own over the summer projects, they would be more likely to do it. There comes a point during childhood when people start to question authority, and start to become rebellious because they think they know what's best for themselves. At some point, kids have to be given that freedom in order for them to fail, gain humility, and then try again. If teachers were the ones designing the projects, students would be less likely to do it, and their grades would suffer.\n \n Teachers will generally tell you that trust is everything. If you don't have trust then you have nothing. Getting to pick your own project as a student, I would be elated. It shows that your teacher trusts that you will make the right decision and that you will get it done. The projects should differ from child to child because if one child wants to excel, then the limitations on the project to make another student comfortable, should not restrict him. Student-designed projects gives the students opportunity to excel in learning and to gain more trust from their teachers. Students usually have breakthroughs at least once during the years they are in school, when they start to realize that what they're learning is important and they start to care about what it is that they're learning, and learning becomes less like a burden and more like a privilege. Designing their own projects could spurr on this breakthrough and help students to realize that school isn't as bad as once anticipated.\n \n Summer should be a break from all the things that cause stress in the everyday lives of students. It should be a time to unwide and relax. Schools are beginning to issue over-the summer projects to make sure that the students keep learning, and remember what they have previously learned. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust. This will ensure that students stay happy over the summer, while teachers are equally as happy knowing that all of their hard work to educate the students has not gone to waste.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Should these summer projects that students work on during their break be teacher-designed or student-designed? Students should be able to put their own ideas in this summer project and designed it the way they want it to be. These projects should help them make their brains become more active since they will be doing these projects over break. By doing this they won't have to \"refresh\" their brain on what they learned the past school year and will already know what to do when they come back to school after break because of this project.\n \n All students should put their ideas into their own projects and don't have to worry about what the teacher may give them. This can make the students become more active in the world or even school, and actually let them do something over break. They should let the students decide what type of project they want to work on that is helpful for them to continue to learn during break. If the students decide what they want to work on, then they should decide if it's going to take them the whole break or a couple of weeks to finish it. For example, they could do something they love to do over break instead of a teacher throwing any type of project to give them. Some students may be busy during break so this gives them the opportunity to work at their own pace. Since they know what they are doing for their project it shouldn't be that hard for them to manage.\n \n If the students designed the projects then it would let them be more engage on what they are learning and what's going on during their break. The school will have less students who are confused on what's going on and the teacher wouldn't have to keep explaining themselves more than once. Also, it can actually make the students want to do the project, because they are doing something they like instead of the teacher designing something boring. Sometimes the students forget about the project that the teachers designed to them because they don't want to do it or they just didn't understand the idea the teacher was giving them. Therefore, if the students designed it themselves then the school and teachers won't have to worry about who did or didn't do the project.\n \n Some people may think that teachers should be able to designed these projects. They may even think that the kids are not mature enough to do it and it's a teachers job to design them things. I understand it is a teachers job to teach the students, but it wouldn't be fun if all the teacher do is use his or her's own ideas. Shouldn't the students have a right to do things they like with the teachers helping them on the side. If they work together with the students and be more active with them, then that's when the students behave more mature and actually want to do the work. No students likes a teacher who only just talks and only do things their way without the students input.\n \n Students should be able to pick out what type of project they want to do and work it out step by step to complete it. If students do this on their own, then they could learn how to plan and manage things by themselves. They would be learning how to be more independent. This way it can help them later on in the future if they ever go to college and even for their future jobs. This could help the students be creative and have different types of creativity and ideas all around the school. Then, the school will have an idea on what interests their students and know more about them individually as a person.Â",

Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to it be able to benefit them the upcoming school year.\n \n To start with, teachers can give students guidelines for the project. The more instructions the students are able to have then the more understandable the project can be. Getting guidelines can give the students more ideas and can be less frustrating doing the project can be. For example,Generic_Name,a student at Generic_School,is spending time starting her project,she is confused on what to do from the beginning until she opened the guidelines that she was giving, having the guidelines made it much more easier to finish due to having a list on what was needed for the project.\n \n Secondly,having to do projects under teacher circumstances can be beneficial for related times in the future. Many more projects could come and be far more complicated,but using their current knowledge from past experience can make the project less frustrating. For example,Generic_Name has to start an project,now that the students are back in school from break,in the past he would struggle with projects,but by using his past knowledge that he learned,he had finished and reached all the expectations needed. In conclusion,using knowledge that you learned from the same situation in the past on your current ones can very much help in the future.\n \n Some people may disagree due to others seeing it in different ways. Others may see the project as not interesting because the students should be able to do it the way they want to due to them having to do the object during the summer and it not being able to benefit them because the students can not look back on their mistakes. Although, the project not being interesting should not be the case because they are learning not playing around. In addition, the students should know that having ideas on an project can help more so confusing them.\n \n In conclusion,these are my reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The project being teacher-designed,allows more ideas that the students are able to use and makes the project easier.

Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.\n \n Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic.

      "Hello, reader! My name is Generic_Name. Some schools require student to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. many question if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that students should be the ones planning their own summer projects because it will be their summer vacation that they'll have in order to work on it. If the teachers are the ones designing the projects for their students, then teachers will most likely get the same thing from every student. Not only that, we as students may not enjoy doing it as much, because when it comes to doing big projects like these, we desire to put in our own creativity. For these next two paragraphs, I will be talking about these two reasons in greater detail before ending this prompt with my conclusion. They will be backed up mostly by my personal experience, but I will put in my own opinions and reasons. I will also be putting in lots of unique words that will this prompt more interesting. Now, let's begin.\n \n I don't believe teachers should be the ones planning out the project not for the fact that what they would assign will be boring or bad, but because each student might end up doing the same thing for each individual prompt, even if each student does put theyre own unique sense of creativity into them. For example, last year when I was doing Driver's Ed, we entered the part of Health & First Aid. And when all was said and done, we were given a project to do. It had to be be done on a tri-fold and the information had to be a printed out PowerPoint. I'll be honest, I really wasn't a happy chum doing the project at first, although I did enjoy doing the PowerPoint part of the project mostly because I have a love for PowerPoints. When the day came for the projects to turned in and graded, we all showed our own tri-folds to the class. Here, I noticed that we all did similar things in each of our tri-folds. True, we were each given a different topic to work on and many us got a little creative, but in the end we were pretty much the same.\n \n I understand that they do that to make certain we don't procrastinate or do minimum, but in order the project to have some form of uniqueness & full creativity, the student should have complete charge over the what & how of the project. an example of this happened last year in my Spanish II class, where we did a project that was about choosing three Latino recipes and write them out in Spanish. Our teacher, Sr. Generic_Name allowed us to make our project however we wanted, from being a cookbook, miniature tri-fold, PowerPoint, etc. But he also wanted to see our full potential, not just in art but in language as well, so using an online translator was generally unacceptable. And although he was fine with three simple but complete sheets of paper, there wouldn't be any bonus points for that. Fortunately, I paid attention in his class and my mother a Puerto Rican cookbook which she lend to me to use. Also, I don't mean to brag but I'm a great artist who it self-taught.\n \n Overall, I believe that students should their own thing in the project while at the same time, the teachers should receive something of great quality. The two examples I just talked about are my personal experiences & reasons why I believe in the power of the student, although I greatly understand the teacher's viewpoint giving us the basic backbone. So, in a way, neither side is perfect or wrong. But of course, thats just my opinion.",

      "Have you ever had to do summer projects during summer break? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects.\n \n Some people say summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would help them practice for topics that would be discussed the next school year. However, summer projects should be student-designedÂ because students could be more creative with what they do. For example, when a teacher assigns you a project the set their projects to be something specificÂ like: show a graph, create a drawing of this, and/or write a ESSAY about this. When there are limited options like this, students that struggle at something like drawing could be put at a disadvantage and not grade as high as other students. Thats why if summer projects are student-designed students would be able to show off the talents they have and be more creative with what they present as their summer project.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because student can go at their own pace. For example, some projects could require students to do something that they dont understand and therefore they wouldn't be able to complete their project. However, if summer projects would be student-designed the students would be able to complete the project because they could do something that they know how to do and its at their own learning pace and they could also help teacher know what a student struggles at and what they know really well.\n \n Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do complete their project. For example, one of the reasons many student don't complete their projects is because they think that the projects are too boring or are too hard. However, if the students get to choose what they are going to turn in as their summer project then they would do projects that they think are fun or aren't too hard and many more students would turn in their projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects. For these reasons, I implore teachers to allow summer projects to be student-designed.",

      "On that faithful June afternoon, the school bell rings for its last time in three months. Students rush out of their classes and greet the summer with open arms. Of course, once school opens up again in August, many of these students have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Many schools assign projects to complete over the summer in order to keep their students' minds sharp; however, there are debates as to whether the teachers or the students should design the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so students can properly develop the tools that will help them succeed the following year.\n \n Teacher-designed projects will set the rigor of the class so students know what to expect. It is most likely that the teacher that assigns the project will be the one instructing the class. If teachers design the project, they can set the guidelines for the year in their summer assignment so students are not caught off guard. This is especially important for higher level classes such as honors or AP; it is best that all students are aware of the class' expectations so they can develop their skills as necessary for the course. Students can also decide whether or not the class is right for them, whether it be because it is too rigorous, not rigorous enough, or simply because the subject matter does not interest them. This way there is less fuss during the school year as students try to switch their classes.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can allow the students to grow their academic independence. During the school year, teachers are readily available in case students need to answer questions. However, during the summer it is not as easy as raising one's hand in class; students are almost entirely on their own. They will have to develop the skills needed to solve a novel problem independently. This ability is referred to by psychologists as fluid intelligence. One's fluid intelligence decreases with age, so it is important for students to strengthen it while they are young. Students may also find useful academic tools that help them to understand the material of the class. One of the more well known of these tools is Khan Academy. Students often go to these websites to understand what they could not in class. Finding these tools during the summer will prove useful, as they can still be used during the school year.\n \n While student input is important, the teachers are more likely to give projects that are closer in rigor and content to the actual class. Teachers have been trained both in teaching that the subject that they teach, so they likely know the best way to prepare students for what lies ahead. This is why summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students.",

      'Having to do school work over the summer? Summer assignments is a great way for students to not forget everything they learned over the school year. If a student goes from June to September without reviewing their course material from the previous years, they are bound to forgetting lots of important information. Students have very creative minds and should be able to come up with their own way of studying or going over past information. Teacher designed assignments can force students to do unnecessary research which can waste a lotÂ of time. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows each student to put their time in to something that interests them, teachers can learn more about their future students, and teacher designed projects sometimesÂ dis encourageÂ students to complete them.\n \n There is nothing better in school or in life when you are interested in a subject. It is much easier to pay attention and a lot more information that sticks with you. Doing a lot of research into a topic your not interested in is more or less a waste of time. A project led by a student could influence others to a career choice. Having to do work is never fun especially in summer but if students get to be creative they can find a topic which makes it more enjoyable. Teacher designed projects limits students into following certain formats and structures which limits the thought process being taken into place thinking about the project. Once again interesting topics lead to better productivity and work which is why students need to design their own projects.\n \n Forming relationships as a teacher is something that can change a students life forever. There are many kids in today society who feel like they don\'t belong or fit in. Knowing and appreciating someone the smallest can impact them more than someone can imagine. A student who creates their own project or structure will definitely tell you something about them. Engaging students with each others work is important to show the passion one may have for what they made. Student designed projects open up the opportunity to really show how much a subject matters and what can be done to change a way in society that is failing. Teachers knowing more about their students is important for students to want to come to class and for teachers to know when someone is not appearing to be feeling their normal selves.\n \n Teacher designed projects are usually straightÂ forward. When a student designs a project they complete much more work. Now I would say that if the students are below 5th grade having teacher designed projects is the better option due to most students at that level not being educated enough to think outside of the box. Regardless learning will take place on both sides and that students will dive deep enough into a subject to break the ice. Relationships will form from students bonding over ideas and sharing them with each other.\n \n When the question "should a teacher or student design a summer project?" comes up, I am aware that both sides has an argument but that students designing it is way more impactful to themselves and others. Career choices can easily be introduced while just selecting a topic. Forcing students to be oppurtunitive and aware student designed projects open it all up and enable them to select something that is interesting and important. Teacher designed projects are good when there is not a lot of time but having the whole summer gives each student many hours to work on an design their own masterpiece.',

      "Have you ever got a summer project?Â Summer projects are boring to do when all you want to do is have fun. Although, teachers can make the projects subject based and more specific.Â Students should design the summer projects because some students don't have access to internet, the projects will be unique, and the projects will have more effort and participation.\n \n Firstly, some students don't have access to the internet. Most projects involve research. If the students can't do the research how are they going to do the project? Some teachers expect the project to be done but what if it can't be. Teachers need to realize not everyone has internet at home. For example, a student was given a project on King Henry's life. He doesn't have internet at home and the library is too far to walk. The student never did his project and got a really bad grade.\n \n Secondly, the projects will be unique. The ideas that students can come up with are amazing. Kids have an unlimited amount of imagination and creativity, so letting them express that through a graded project can be really fun. For example, if the students were doing a science project. They have so many possibilities on what they can do. They could put Mentos in a diet Coke and write down what happens. If it was a photography project, the students can express themselves through the pictures and edit them however you want. There's so many more ideas tat students can come up with if you let them.\n \n Thirdly, The projects will have more effort and participation. If the students have their own say, or choice, in what they get to do the project on, there would be more projects turned in. Plus, the effort put into the projects would be greater. For example, one class gets to choose their project and another class do not get to choose. The class that got to pick their project has more projects, and more effort put into the projects, then the class that didn't get to choose. Another example is the teachers choose what students do one year for summer projects. Many students do not put in a lot of effort, just enough to get a good grade, and some don'tÂ even bother turning it in. The next year, the teachers let the students pick what to do for their projects. Most of the students turn in the projects and a lot of effort was put into them.\n \n In conclusion, students should design the projects instead of the teachers. Some students do not have internet. The projects will be unique. Also, the effort put it and the participation of the projects will be greater. If you have a summer project, convince your teacher to let the class design it. You'll see so many cool projects you might have not thought of.",

When teacher give projects, the student is limited to what they can do.\n \n When student are given projects and is able to do their own topic, they don't stay on the topic they choose.\n \n I think summer projects should be teacher-designed. This would be better because the students have a topic, its easy, and is fast to do.\n \n First, the students has topic. When a student has a one topic, they cant go talk about another topic. The student doesn't have to struggle between three or more subjects because they have one given to them. The teacher gives a specific topic because it's supposed to challenging. They want the students to use their brains.\n \n Second, the topic is easy. Some school teachers give their students easy topics because they wants students to enjoy their summer break. The subject should be easy for two reason for example: they had the topic before or its very simple.\n \n Third, the subject is fast to do. The topic should be fast to do because the teacher was able to do it. Their previous students was able to do it with no problem.

      "In a 2019 survey about homework during the summer, it was found that the majority of students said that they were extremely stressed aboutÂ summer assignments that teacher's had required them to do. Many of the students expressed that they had busy schedules and could not find the time to complete the assignments. Other's said that the projects were too difficult and confusing because they were designed poorly.Â While some will say that these summer assignments should continue to be designed by teachers because they are more educational, to be beneficial, the assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption.\n \n Firstly, summer assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom. For instance, the majority of the assignments are question or ESSAY based. This means that instead of enjoying a learning activity that applies to them, students will have to answer dull repetitive questions and write uninteresting ESSAYs about topics that they have no passion for. In result, students will put minimum effort into the assignments and finish them without learning anything. Also, if the summer assignments were designed by the students, they would pick a topic that they have interest in or believe would be enjoyable to complete. For example, if a project was assigned that allowed students to present an issue that they found interesting, the student would more than likely be excited and motivated to write about their topic. Overall, projects assigned during the summer should be designed by the students in order to prevent boredom.\n \n Secondly, students should design their summer assignments to prevent frustration. This is because during the summer, teachers will assign packets or papers that are confusing and difficult to complete, thinking that it will be beneficial or educational. However, this is not the case. Many students will find themselves stuck or frustrated trying to complete something that they have no idea how to do. This results in uncompleted or incorrect work that then starts the student's school year off poorly. Furthermore, if the assignments were designed by the students, they would have the ability to preview and understand what the project is asking. In other words, they would have the correct knowledge going into the assignment and will ultimatelyÂ learn more about the material for the following school year. In the end, a project designed by a student will prevent frustration.\n \n Lastly, summer projects designed by the students will take up less time. This is because many students are extremely busy during the summer. Between sports, vacations, and possible online classes, students find it difficult to manage summer homework. Teachers are not aware of every student's schedule and can assign projects that are almost impossible to complete. However, if the projects were designed by the students, this would not occur. Instead, students would design a project that they could easily time manage and complete in their own time. Also, because teacher-designed projects are long and complicated, this can cause a student to miss out on fun activities. This is becauseÂ of the created stress and limited time that the students often experience from the projects assigned. For example, during the summer, many students are traveling and are rarely in town at the same time. However, when they are, a student with an unfinishedÂ project, could miss out on an opportunity to see their friend because they are too busy with homework. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed because this would prevent time consumption.\n \n Overall, students should design the summer projects. This is because it will prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption. If students experience these effects, the projects assigned will not only ultimately be ineffective but it will cause unnecessary stress. The purpose of summer is to enjoy a break from school anxiety. If projects do not reflect this, then a student's summer could possibly be ruined. In the end, in order prevent this, talk to your teacher and see if your summer could be saved with an enjoyable, simple, and quick project instead.Â",

      "Throughout a students educational experience, they have the 3 month break at the end of each year that allows them to have time off and have a break from the intense rigor of school. Although, the break can better be purposed by having assignments to further their knowledge during this time period. These projects can best be designed as student led so that students can have more creativity and imagination towards the project, specialize one topic based on future educational interest, and ensures that students have the resources they need to complete the assignment.\n \n From Kindergarten through grade 12, each student is given a curriculum to follow and learn for a standardized test at the end of the year; student led summer projects would allow for a broader outlook on their schooling education and explore topics that would not be looked at otherwise. A student who only learns about their immediate community and ecosystem can gain a broader perspective on society after completing a summer project about an ecosystem in another region of the world. The additional thought and imagination put into a project like this would be hard to complete in an organized project created by a teacher. Furthermore, students commonly bored duringÂ one project that a large group of students have to complete. The rules and rubric which have to be followed deprive the students of exploration and investigation which is crucial for a successful education. Allowing for students to find their choice of exploration and then present it in a unique way brings a complex ideology about interesting topics. Not only is the content of student led projects productive, but so is the way of deriving that information. Commonly, classrooms follow a strict set of rules to ensure each students safety, but those rules come with a cost. The rules cause students to think in one way, act in one way, and test in one specific way. A summer project which gives students space to compete based on their creativity allows them to break out of those boundaries and complete what they want to complete.\n \n A students future college path can also be benefited by student based summer projects due to the option of focusing on their desired topic. As students age into their final years of high school, many already know the path they want to take in college and ultimately their occupations. Giving students an option to focus and research on these topics will not only allow them to understand more about the topic but also build their application to give them a better chance at getting into respected schools. A student who wants to explore the medical pathway might use the summer project as a chance to see what the field is about. That student might shadow surgeons or pediatricians and then analyze and report their findings. The alternate option of teacher led student projects would not allow for this type of unique opportunity. Using the report of their findings, a student can better apply for prestigious college opportunities, scholarships and programs through their past experience that gives them a step up from their competing applicants.\n \n Lastly, the guidelines given to the entirety of the public schooling system leaves students in lower socioeconomic situations to not be able to complete certain projects. The student led project system allows students to find a topic that is accessible for them rather than one that has a large demand for expensive purchases. Certain projects specifically in the science department, require an excessive amount of resources making them hard to obtain out of the school setting. If the teacher led projects would require students to purchase these goods, difficulties would arise in regards to the ability for all students to have access and an abundance of these items. Although supplies may be given through the schooling system, a work spaceÂ might be difficult to obtain as well. Choosing a project that not only gains the students interest but also allows them to complete it with ease displays the benefits of student led projects.\n \n Projects that can be completed during the summer should be led by the students desires and aspirations as it will gain allow for the most success of the student. Student led projects show most effective through the ability for students to use their imagination, research a topic they might study in college, and complete the work productively and efficiently.",

      "Every year students look forward to going on summer break and getting away from school. This three month break often involves forgetting important skills and not learning new information. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to solve these problems. These projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that the project is relevant, has a difficulty on grade level with that of the student, and allows for easy collaboration and communication.\n \n While being able to pick their own topic for a summer project may be more fun for students, a teacher-designed project would insure that the information being learned connects to what they need to know for school. A random project in the middle of break is a waste of time if the teacher cannot connect it to what the students will be learning in class. For example, a physics teacher may want to assign a project to introduce momentum or energy, this will allow students to come into class with a general understanding of the subject. Having a project with a specific learning goal will make students feel as if they are making the most of their time and are learning something that will be useful in the future.\n \n When given the task of creating their own projects, students will often design the easiest project they can get away with. Teachers can ensure appropriate difficulty in the projects by designing them themselves. Projects can be adjusted so they are suitable for different grades and class types; the more difficult the class is, the more difficult the project will be. Students wouldn't be able to complete the easiest project they can or overestimate themselves and design a project too hard.\n \n During the summer it is important for students to be able to contact their teachers and ask for help. If a project is student-designed, a teacher may have difficulty assisting a student if they become confused and need help. A teacher-designed project would make asking for and receiving help a lot easier. If the teacher-designed project were to be uniformly distributed to all students taking similar class, the students would be able to collaborate and ask each other for help as well. Completing the assignment in groups would be more fun for the students and easier to grade for the teachers.\n \n Summer projects need to be teacher-designed so they are on topic, have a reasonable difficulty, and allow for optimal communicate and collaboration. Summer projects are often dreaded by students, but a teacher-designed project is more beneficial than a student-designed project.",

      "After school ends, most children spend their summers relaxing with their friends and family. Not many of us do anything educational on the rare occasion that we may read a book. Because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning during their break. Students should be able to design their own projects because the project itself will be more enjoyable, easier to complete, and more beneficial to students in terms of knowledge.\n \n Many of the projects that teachers assign during the school year are pretty boring. By designing their own summer project, students can have a fun experience with it. Not only that, but students will also be much more inclined to actually do the project. As an AP student, I have been assigned summer assignments for classes, which I ended up doing last minute. These assignments weren't hard, but they ended up being pretty long since we were given two months to complete them. Since I pushed them to the last minute, I was sitting in my house for hours for the last couple of days trying to get these projects done. Now, if I had found a project to do for the class, I would have completed it throughout the course of the break and would have had had a much better time completing it.\n \n Something that we all know is that if you are actually interested in completing the task at hand, you will be much more efficient in completing it rather than a task you are not interested in. Because of this exact reason, students should be able to design their own project because it would be way easier to complete. Not only that, but students will actually feel like its their own task to complete, rather than some random assignment that is assigned by the teacher. Most students, including myself, complete homework for a class the night before its due. Many people think the ideal way of completing homework is to complete it the day it is assigned, but since, most of the time, students aren't really interested in the work, they end up cramming it to a later day. Although, if the student has a task from something that they are interseted in, such as the sport they play, then they will do that as soon as they can.\n \n Another beneficial factor from being able to design your own summer project is that it is much more knowledgeable then a tradtional assignment. What I mean by more knowledgeable is how much knowledge the student actually gains from completing a specific assignment. A particular assignment may require research that allows students to gain a lot of knowldedge, but if the student is bored by the topic, then they will just try to finish the assignment by whatever means possible. They will not try to learn the topic, and will probably end up getting the answers online or from a friend. If we compare this to another scenerio where the assignment pertains less information, but actually interests the student, then the student will definetely walk away with much more knowledge than they did before. Because of this, students should be able to design their own summer projects.\n \n Many people think that if students design their own summer projects, then they will just goof around and try to pick a very easy topic. This is arguable, as teachers can easily set boundaries for their students and have certain requirements such as having a minimum word count, page count, etc. All in all, students can have a good time and gain plently of knowledge if they are able to design their own summer project.Â",

      "Summer projects must be designed by teachers or the whole thing will be pointless. It is said there are many contraversial points that would lead folks to not taking a side on whether students should design summer projects, or if teachers should. However, projects need to be designed and assigned by teachers because it will set the standard of validation, express uniqueness and diversity, and reduce chances of cheating.\n \n First, having summer projects designed by teachers sets the tone on what the outcome should look like and how well a student must do. This prevents student's from simply waiting until the last week of summer and sloppily making a project that is eventually accepted by a teacher. Also, this action will assure the continued process of students learning while on summer break. The whole point of summer projects is so the students keep their minds fresh and ready for the next year, and If the students design the projects, that may not happen.\n \n Next up, teachers will find expressions of uniqueness and diversity in the results they recieve from the students. Every kid is different, and a teacher should be able to recognize that kids best interests and strongest characteristics. With that being known, teachers can design and assign summer projects accordingly. With every kid either working on a project that includes something they are comfortable with, or something they might need to work on more to be successful. This also reveals the different mindsets and creative skills a classroom holds, while a student designed project may just be basic and super boring.\n \n Last, the amount of cheating is bound to decrease when projects are designed by students. If a kid designed his own project over a span of a couple months, there's a big possibility he may cheat. These kids may also \"accidentally\" choose the same topic to work on all summer. There are endless possibilities and ways for a students to get away with the easy way out. Which is why, when a teacher assigns different topics and types of projects to a wide variety of students, it reduces cheating. This ultimately does help the students learn how to try new things, even if they aren't familier with it.\n \n Although this may be true, many believe that when teachers assign and or design summer projects for students, it will come out boring and no fun. People also believe it won't bring out the creative side in a student. But, the understanding of a student being creative and crafty is how they handle something that is thrown at them. The creativeness that lies in a student is how they can transform something out of their interest into something they can enjoy. Teacher designed projects bring out the capability of a kid and what that kid can truly do.\n \n All in all, summer projects are genuinely more productive and useful when designed by a teacher. It gives the students a chance to be creative and show unique skills, reduces the amount of unloyal actions such as cheating and working together, and it sets the standard for a student to meet. To all teachers who will read this, I advise you to keep the power in your hands. Bring out that student's inner strengths and challenge that student. One day, that student will thank you for not letting them take the easy way out.",

If the project is teacher designed then it gives no way for the students to express their creativity. By allowing students to design their own project they will have a way to voice their opinions on something they may be concerned or upset about. It would also allow students to design a project about something that may interest them.\n \n If students design their own project they can voice their opinions on something there concerned about. Say for instance a student was worried about people speeding through his neighborhood. He could make his project about that concern and talk about ways or measures that should be put in place to prevent it from happening. This would also make the student work harder due to the fact that this is a problem that the student faces and would want people to know about that problem so that others can be informed on that issue.\n \n Student designed projects allow students to create a project on a subject that interests them. For example,say a student is interested in becoming a mechanic after they are done with school. If they research and design a project on that subject it can give them an outlook into the future if that is an occupation they are interested in. It can also give them a head startÂ in that career path with the knowledge they would learn from creating the project.\n \n If the project is teacher designed it can help students get ready for next year with school related material.

      "Summer projects keep the mind sharp. However often tedious, summer projects can often be beneficial as it can prepare the students for the following year or preferebly life. Some believe that these projects should be teacher designed so that students have the base kowledge on what will be covered that year, however that's not what learning is about. Learning is a life long journey not a journey to the next test. If these summer projects were student designed, where students had the freedom to choose, they could work on a something they truly found interesting. These projects could give them life experience rather than school experience.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects can be anything from work experiece to writing a noval. For example if a student loved to write and thought they may have a carreer as a jounalist or even an author they may decide their time was best spent on sharpening those skills. Not only would their time be spent to make themselves a better writer but also they would excited to do the work. However what if a student decides to make their project a job or even an internship at some law firm, well that is even better. These students will come back to school with more maturity, life experience and perhaps some money in the bank.\n \n Another outcome of student designed summer projects is rather than coming back the school with dred and resentment, they'll come back excited to showcase what they've learned. For example if teachers assigned a massive work load on everything they might need to pass the tests during the year, students will be anxious, unmotivated and stressed by the first day of school. This would kill students desire to learn and cause resentment towards teachers. However, if students can come back to school with the confidence that they are able to learn and experiece things by themselves, students will come into school postive and inspired to learn rather than being negative and unmotivated.\n \n Finally, there is a difference between schooling and learning. Schooling is a soley a tool to educate individuals however it is temporary. Learning is rather a life long jouney, something that should never stop. There is learning before school such as when you learned to walk and talk for the first time and then there is learning after school when you get a job or simply when you read a book. That is why summer projects should be the students responsibility, so that they can learn to learn by themselves. Sadly too many students believe that learning and schooling are the same thing and their life long jouney ends once they leave school.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be the students responsibility. These summer projects should inspire students to learn and experience new things. The goal is to have students motivated when they return to school rather than stressed and anxious for the year to end. Lastly learning is a life long jouney, schooling is temporary.",

      "One of the most truly modern American experiences has got to be voicing one's opinion on a subject they have little to know knowlege or experience with to the world. Unfortunately, today my opinion will not be voiced to the world as this is a SOL test, but it will be a scarecly informed opinion for sure. I have the privilige of never being assigned a project by a school over the summer, but today's prompt has drawn something to my attention that I never quite thought about before- That these summer projects assigned by schools should absolutely be designed by the students who have to do them as they can then be tailored to fit the students interests and schedules, within reason of course.\n \n Starting off positive, the most obvious pro of student designed summer projects is the creative liberty. Students would not only be free to pick whatever topic or subject they like, but the form their project takes. A student could go the conventional route and do a presentation with a trifold or something similar, or go in the opposite direction and hold a workshop explaining why purple light doesn't technically exist, complete with interactive features. They may even incorporate their other summer activities into their project, as a student traveling to France for the summer might research a part of French history and include their own photos that they took that relate to the topic. Speaking of other summer activities, students with jobs, internships, or anything else that may take up multiple hours of the day could then ensure that the project they give themself is something that they can handle.\n \n Now that I've explained all the wonderful pros of student designed projects, lets reign it back in a bit and disscuss the cons and some solutions to those cons along with my mildly valid expertise. I've been a girl scout since I was in elementary school and for the past few summers been doing research for a gold award project, the highest honor that a girl scout can earn. The main focus of a gold award is of course the project, which is designed entirely by the scout, may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year, and a proposal of said project has to be approved by a council.\n \n Granted, this is on a bit of a larger scale compared to a school summer project, but there are some good ideas that could be drawn from this. Approval of the project idea could ensure that the projects have genuine learning value, and could be approved by the student's counselor. Conselors would then also see to that students give themselves proper workloads, ensuring that they don't overwork themselves, or take the easy route either. Putting a deadline on the approval might also help encourage students to at least think about their project a bit before the night it's due. Gold awards also look good on college applications, and allowing students to make their projects something that they would be so proud of to put on a college application could be a boost in motivation for those college-bound.\n \n The concept of allowing students to have this much control over a project as we move towards an education system where the students are being allowed more control and freedom day by day can be truly great when done correctly. Which can absolutely happen, when necessary restraints are given. It simply requires more work on everyone's part, and considering that educational instititions are supposed to be preparing entire generations for life itself, and not just a workplace or university, that shouldn't be too hard? Perhaps I put too much faith in this but I truly do hope to see the day when students are proactive enough to go about these sorts of things on their own, not for a grade or award, but to better themselves and the world around them.",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer break is a long three months away from school for students to relax, learn new skills and enjoy themselves. Most students tend to forget everything they are taught throughout the school year over this break. Summer break to majority of students is time for having the best time of their lives doing all the things they love which hardly ever includes academic work. Teacher-designed summer projects would be a very effective way to ensure students keep receiving knowledge throughout their summer break because education is a continuous process. Teachers would be the best choice to design these summer projects because they thoroughly know the syllabus of the course they teach, they would give realistic projects students can complete on time and teachers would be fair in selecting the type and criteria of the project.\n \n Teachers have all the information about the courses they teach and what their students need to know each year. Teacher-designed projects would entail the necessary topics and lessons for students to work on during their summer break. Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students. Students might also just want to create projects that would be very easy to complete just so they can get it over with. At the end of the day if students are allowed to create their own projects they end up learning nothing new because it was based on stuff they already knew. For example a Geometry teacher teaching tenth graders would not create a math project for tenth grade students based on sixth grade math because that is way below them.\n \n With teacher designed-projects they are more likely to have realistic amount of work and would be possible for students to complete and meet the goal at the end of the break, teachers would most definitely not give too much work to overburden students since they also need some rest or too little work to students but give them just enough work for the break. But if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge. A teacher who teaches a 12th grade English class could give a summer project for students to read and summarize a book of their choice and find out the meanings of 20 new words in the book but students would have probably wanted a project where they just write out ten new words from the book they read.\n \n Every student always wants the easy way out of everything so if allowed to create a summer project would just create a project based on what they are very good at for example; a project with artwork, a crossword puzzle or a project about their own sentences and this would lead to a disagreement among the students to pick the best project which would be good for everyone. However, a teacher would not be biased in choosing a summer project for their students, they would assign a project based on skills all their students are expected to know or already have without picking out what some particular people would want in that class.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know the best approaches and methods when it comes to projects for their students because they have worked with many different students over the years and came up with very effective teacher-designed summer projects to help their students keep learning over the break without stressing them.

      "During the school year, a student completes set projects and curriculum in order to pass the classes which they are enrolled in. Over the summer, however, some schools require that projects should be assigned to students so that they continue to learn. I think that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students.\n \n Student designed projects will allows students to explore new fields that they may be interested in. If students are able to design their own summer projects, then they are able to choose a topic that is interesting to them for this project. This will allow the student to explore, research, and experiment within new fields. This exploration and research of new fields is very beneficial because it helps students find a career path based on what topics they are interested in.\n \n Having student-designed summer projects will inspire creativity. If a student is able to create their own project without need of a rubric or teacher to guide them, then this project is truly coming from the student. This will allow students to really show themselves when completing these projects. If students are just given a teacher-designed project, they are just following a rubric and completing what the teacher wants them to do. This work can be numb and boring for the students who could be using all their creativity on their own self-designed project.\n \n Student-designed projects will take away a lot of the stress that some students have during normal teacher-designed projects. Students will be less focused on doing everything right since the project is designed by them. These students will instead be able to focus on learning the material instead of stressing over getting a good grade. This will improve both the students mental health and the value in learning the student is actually receiving from a project.\n \n Schools should allow these summer projects to be student-designed. Although some may argue that teacher-designed projects are better because it guarantees that a student will learn a specific curriculum, student-designed summer projects have so many more benefits. I believe that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students",

      "The summer project is something that often looms over the minds' of students. We often find students bellyaching about how they are missing out on fun summer activities. More often than not, it is the teachers who assign the projects, and even though teachers are more educated on certain subjects, it would be appropriate to believe that students should design summer projects. This sort of activity over the summer would promote individuality, entrepreneurship, and personal responsibility.\n \n Some people think that individuality is not necessary in an industrial world, but really, it is the backbone of this nation and student designed projects promote such individuality. In the long term, individuality leads to higher paying jobs in the future. It is well known that if more people have high paying jobs, there will be less homelessness and a stimulated economy. As well, creativity stems from a sense of individuality. Fine arts are the future of the world as we are getting closer to not needing hard labor. The arts also jump startÂ economic progress by putting more money into the system. All this individuality leads to entrepreneurship.\n \n There is an argument to be made that not all students will be entrepreneurs, but it is important to nurture entrepreneurial practices, which can be done through aforementioned student designed projects. Entrepreneurs tend to be better off in the real world. This may sound repetitive, but we really need more people with big ideas so that the world can progress. The loss of this kind of person means the loss of all those years spent building the world from the ground up. As well, the process of designing a project could lead to students designing a business in the future. The process for creating such projects is quite involved, and it leads to more focused adults in the future. In reality though, none of this would be possible without a sense of personal responsibility.\n \n Many people in this modern world believe that the only way to become more responsible is to get a job, and while this is partially accurate, projects such as this will always nurture responsibility. For example, completion of projects lead to the student feeling more accomplished. That sense of accomplishment make students feel like accomplishing more will make them feel even better, leading to them being more responsible with projects in their future. As well, project planning in youth will lead to the individual taking charge within projects in their future. It is important to have students be proactive in their career as it will likely lead to better positions and better pay.\n \n To finish, responsibility will only develop if you let your student take charge, be it in a career or in a project. While some people may disagree, this is the truth, hard work cannot do all the heavy lifting. As a country we need to develop our youths' sense of entrepreneurship,individuality, and personal responsibility or else we will not progress as a people.",

      "Students-designed projects should always be assigned even during the school year. Students-design are more understandable that teacher-design. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students.\n \n Even though, teacher-design projects will be able to test our knowledge. They are not made for children the way a student- design would be. Student- design projects will relate to students more because it will be base around us. We will have total control, unlike how sum teacher-design projects have rules and guidelines that stop us from being fully open. For, example i had to do a ESSAY about my summer adventures. I chose to write about the time i visited my grandparents in Florida. A few days went by and my teacher wanted to talk to me. She wanted me to rethink my ESSAY because she did not feel any excitement reading it. I didn't agree with her because i always had fun with my grandparents. We would feed the sea turtles, go on night walks at the beach, and go to the board walk's carnival. She still felt as if i wasn't meet the project requirements. This project played a important role in my grade, so i accepted it and rewrote my ESSAY.\n \n In addition student-based projects will show how creative we are. This will give students the opportunity to show off their talent and ideas. Teacher- designed projects do not always allow students to show what they are fully capable of, it only shows what they want to see. Such as, my friend Generic_Name had to do a portraitÂ for her finals in art. She sketched an amazing portrait with a lotÂ of details, so she could show her skills off. This was very risky, to much detail could throw the sketch off. Her adviser thought that she should do something simple to ensure she will get an easy A. Generic_Name wanted more that a easy grade, she wanted her artwork to inspire people and toÂ make a mark, so she went with her idea instead. Now her paint is hanging in the museum of art and is displayed every month downtown.\n \n Next, Student-designed projects will be way more fun and entertaining for students. Every year we receive projects that are boring and does not interest us. Teacher-designed project have no personality and are way to formal. Students-designed projects can be more funny, silly and excited, it can bring happiness back to school projects. For example, two teachers, Generic_Name and Generic_Name assigned the same project. Generic_Name gave her students a teacher-designed project, but Generic_Name didnt. She let her students chose their own project and gave them a rubric of what she would be looking for. Generic_Name class's project still related to science but was personalized. It showed that they really tried and had fun doing this project. She had never seen so many smiles on students faces as they presented their projects. It showed her that she made the right chose.\n \n In conclusion, these are all the reason why we should get student-designed projects. It is showed that student- designed projects can help and motivate students. Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students. In the end this will be the best for students.",

      "Most schools require students to complete summer projects. Over the years, there has been a debate if these programs should be student-taught or teacher- taught. Summer projects should be teacher- designed because, teachers have a greater knowledge of the subject, are trained to keep kids engaged, and know how to plan a lesson that students can relate to worldly.\n \n Teachers all around the world study the subject(s) that they teach. This gives them greater knowledge than any student would have. Most teachers are required to graduate college, and get a teaching degree as well, (some teachers even get their masters). That is more years of studying a single subject than any high schoolÂ studentÂ may have. Studying this single subject for many years, gives them a lot of experience, and specific knowledge to help educate a student on the subject. Although students can always learn the material, they may not have as great of knowledge as a teacher on one specific subject. Teachers have at least four years of knowledge that a students don't and thats why they're better teachers than a student.\n \n Along with four years of college, teachers must receive a teaching degree. While studying for this degree, teachers learn how to plan out lessons, and keep kids engaged. A teacher would better keep kids engaged, because they are trained to keep kids focused, and keep them involved in the material they learn in class. Weather this is; keeping kids involved in class by doing a project that is hands on, or having them start conversation to create development of their skills and knowledge. Some may argue that students would keep kids more engaged, due to how they can relate to kids their own age, teachers can relate to students too. Teachers know what its like to goo through schooling, because they had to do it too. Teachers are trained to keep students entertained, and develop their skills inside and out of the classroom.\n \n Most teachers enjoy learning about their subject they teach daily, this keeps their material relevant and reputable. Making sure that the teachers material is relevant, helps kids from around the world be able to relate to the lessons. Mr. Generic_Name, is a second grade teacher at Generic_School. Over the summers he likes to practice his teaching, by traveling the world to see if his material is still relevant in other countries. Many teachers will do this to ensure that what theyre teaching their class is resignatingÂ with each student. Keeping teachers' content relevant is a sure way to keep kids relating to the topic.\n \n Summer rprojects should be relatable, engaging, and well taught. That's why Teachers should teach Summer Projects. They've had years of experince, teachers can relate to kids, keep them engaged, and create lessons that relate to the world. Teachers are the best fit to direct summer projects.Â",

I believe summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.\n \n My first reason on why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows the student to be more involvedÂ in what there learning. For example if a student receives a summer project from he or she's teacher it's highly likely that the project will be focused on everything that the student has learned before the summer. But what if the student dose not need to learn everything what if they only need to focus on certain thing that they are struggling with that's why I believe that student-designed projects would benefit students better; because it give them the opertuntitieÂ to create a project that can focus on things that they are struggling with and improve upon it.\n \n Another reason I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it allows students learn at there own speed and level. I personally believe that the summer projects that are given to student are pretty challenging and a lotÂ of students and because of this a lotÂ of student either decides not to do the project or they cheat and end up not learning anything; thats why I feel so strongly that student should be allowed to choose and designed there own projects i believe this will help students learn without being overwhelmedÂ or overly challenged. On the other hand teacher may feel that if theyÂ designed the projects that it will be better for students and they also may feel that overly challenging students is a good thing because it put students in a position to challenge themselves and to learn at a higher level; and while statement has a pointÂ I still have to disagree because while its true that some students may benefit from this there are still a lot of students who wont I believe that a student my first master the level that there at now in order to proceed into a higher level of education.\n \n These are all the reasons i believeÂ summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.Â Â",

      "Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.\n \n Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.\n \n Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.\n \n Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",

Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. People debate on whether the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would allow the student to be more creative, do a project they would enjoy, and gives students more independence.\n \n If students were to be required to make a summer project and it was student-designed, it would let students be more creative. Most teachers and parents want their student/child to think outside the box. A student led project would make students use their brain more, during their 2 month long break of not doing anything. The project would allow students to develop an independent mind. They would give a nudge for students to get out of their comfort zone. The project would make students think more independently at a younger age. As they get older, they will be more inclined to do things out of their comfort zone. Supporting a student to lead his summer project would make the next generation more creative.\n \n A student led summer project would allow students to pick a topic they would enjoy. Majority of people will produce quality work if they have a passion for it. People like to work on projects they enjoy and can open their minds to. If someone likes a subject they will most likely want to pursue that subject. Some students will find the topics a teacher gives them boring and unmotivating. This is due to the fact that one person cannot satisfy everyone in the room. If a student doesn't like a topic they will not enjoy it and it will not accurately represent their academic skills. Allowing students to lead their own summer projects, means they will pick something they will enjoy and have a passion for.\n \n Doing a student led summer project would give students more independence. Students would have to take more responsibility. If a student were to do bad on a project they would have to take responsibility for their actions. It would train the next generation to take responsibility instead of blaming someone else. This would give students more preparation for the adult life. They school system gives little to no preparation on how to manage an adult life, but it would give students a little more experience for the students. A project like this would give people a little nudge to grow up gradually. Summer projects would give more independence, if it was student led.\n \n Student led summer projects would, overall, allow students to be more creative, do something they enjoy, and give students more independence.

      "Should schools require students complete summer projects during the summer? Honestly I think if your behind like at the end of the year you could do these summer projects to get you caught up, that would help a lot of students like me. I think they should be designed by the students after all it's our summer. I just dont think school should be pushing us like that we're to young for that. They already keep us in school for about eight or nine months then most students work really hard to get to where they need/want to be.\n \n Me personally, I would want the teachers to design the projects but only since its summer I would not be ok with that. Most students put in so much work just to get a couple more pointless projects during the summer at lease if the the students design it will be something simple, but not to simple. I already know if the teachers design it would be something that's so difficult and extra and it's the summer so they will say something like you had all the time in the world to complete this. But thats not how its supposed to be it should be something I could complete in a week or two. We shouldnt have to go to school for that long just to get stuck with some summer projects design by some teachers that probably dont even know me.\n \n Maybe if the teachers and the students designed the projects together we could come up with something. I would not care if it wasn't the summer but I can't lie projects in the summer would be smart. The only thing is I feel like the teacher would just throw something at us. If it was graded like extra credit or something when school start that would be way more motivation to get ahead way before school even start. Sometimes we just need a break, just a small one because we do so much in and out of school y'all teachers and staff don't know what goes on out of school, they never do.\n \n In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects but the teachers should check of on them to make sure they're not to easy. We work hard through out the school year just to get to the summer and i dont think it should be to hard for them or to long. During school, most teachers gives us little time to do the most difficultÂ projects in the school year, just like last year. Even tho we should be relaxing in the summer this is kind of a neat idea and would keep us on task for the next school year.

Others think it'll be a horrible assignment because the teacher is creating the requirements. If students really pay attention to what's happening they'll realize the teacher is making the class do less work compared to what students wanted. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they have more experience, they'll make sure the class covers new material, and it'll be easier for teachers to grade.\n \n Teachers know what results they want when it comes down to projects. They've went to college, learned about designing projects, and spent their time and money on being taught how to grade and make assignments. The school faculty know our strengths and weaknesses, what we need and what we don't, teachers have walked in our shoes. They know what students want before the students know.\n \n The schools number one priority is to teach and make students learn new information. Teachers know how to introduce new topics, ideas, and questions that'll force students to use their brain. They're aware of what children know and don't know. Teachers know that it would take too long for students to make their assignment because they haven't been taught how to grade or make a rubric to grade with.\n \n Having the teachers design the project will be easier for them to grade. They know what they want to look for in the assignment. Teachers teach, make assignments, and grade for a living, and they know what to expect. The school faculty know what we'll achieve and what we'll fail at, they making rubrics and grading systems designed for students.\n \n However, students would have fun inventing their own requirements for the assignment, but students just use what they already know. Teachers will make sure others learn because that's their job. They'll have students focus on the project, and not creating it.\n \n In conclusion, having the teacher design the classes summer project makes it easier for you and your teacher.

    ESSAY:
      "Giving teachers an extra task like designing a summer based project can be hard or easy it really just depends on how you look at the situation. Teachers assignÂ projects all year, so this should be no different. There are many types of teachers that teach many different subjects that have to be remembered. Students are expected to learn numerous things in just one school year, so being assigned a summer project covering everything and adding in new topics can generate ideas for students and get them to researching on their own and teaching them selfÂ things they never knew. Teachers will be available for emails from students and or parents to ask for help or a guiding hand. A lot of the time students are asked questions by teachers throughout the school year on things they were not taught or on things they cannot remember, so being assigned a project that is in dept could save them from that one embarrassmentÂ in front of their classmates.\n \n First, students will be introduced to new topics in their project. This will get students to thinking and they will want to research since technology is the biggest thing right now. This will result in them participating and they will find out new information while completing their work. The new topics will help them learn stuff that is expected to be covered. The remembering will be first priority in their project. Students will have a variety of topics in each subject and they will be expected to complete it fully. No student is allowed to leave anything undone or uncompleted. Each student is encouraged to email their teacher or research the topics and find out any information, just saying they did not understand or they did not know what to put will be unacceptable.\n \n Secondly, every teacher will be expected to leave contact information to be reached. Students are only expected to contact their teacher for help on his or her project. This is given to every student but mainly for ones without internet. There are also students who do not have parents or anyone they can rely on to help them so the teachers information is there for anyone nobody is singled out. Parents that graduated years ago may not be able to include input to their children work because they were not taught the same or know many of the things students are taught now so they are more than welcome to contact teachers for any information pertaining to the subject, this will maybe even help parents learn something.\n \n Students should create their own projects to show what they learned all year and what they do not know. Not every child needs a guiding hand or someone to lead them in the right direction. Each student can come up with their own project to show that they remember important lessons from class meetings. The teachers should not have to take their summer time to email parents and students back about things they were taught while in school. On the other hand, few students make it to class everyday to be apart of the class discussionsÂ and are not allowed to hear the notes. A lot of the things that teachers go over during class is not put into the missing work folder. The teacher could have given out many really important points that any student could have easily not paid any attention to, misheard, or was not in class to hear. Being assigned this project can help many students learn new things or relearn something they probably did not understand.\n \n To conclude this, teacher-designed projects can not only benefit students it helps them relearn things they did not understand. Nobody is perfect and anyone is capable of not knowing the right information due to miscommunication. It is alright to ask for help if you do not understand it is recommend to students. Some things can be self taught, but still not fully understood. Having a teacher that is willing to put in the effort to help his or her students shows dedication and any student should be thankful and take the help. By the end of the school year students are probally burnt out with tons of work and this project could bring back so much information that was covered.Â",

      "Some schools will assign students projects over summer break to assure they will continue to learn school subjects. Summer is a long time and will give the students enough time to learn what is needed. There is a small debate as to whether the students or the teachers should design these projects. Although many teachers will assign and create these projects because they can make sure the students will learn what they need to learn, students should design these projects because many teachers will give to big of a project, many students might not have enough time to work on said project, and giving the student the ability to create the project will assure it can get done.\n \n The first reason to support this claim is that teachers may give to big of a project. Normally, teacher will give a student a project to work on and learn but there is no telling how big that project could be. The teacher could say to create 1 deck of study cards or to write a 10 page ESSAY on something that student may not have learned about. And many times the student may not get the project done in a way the teacher likes because they did not get a chance to go over something like that. Lastly, sometimes the student can get anxious or nervous about having to create a project as big or small as the teacher assigns.\n \n Secondly, a student may not have the time to work on a big project. Teachers look forward to the summer just as much as kids do. Summer is a time to hang out with family or earn some money at a job. Many students simply will not have enough time to worry about creating a big school project. Everyone has responsibilities, like work, family, or just household tasks, and lots of people can not make enough time to work on summer projects. Also depending on how big the assigned project will be and how many teachers assign projects can be to much and give a student not enough time to complete them all.\n \n Lastly, if a students designs a project they can make it so that it can revolve around their schedule. A teacher will normally give students a big project and expect it to be done without thinking about how a student has a life outside of school just like a teacher. For the majority of students, they are too busy with summer responsibilities to be able to work on a teacher assigned school project. If a student is given the right to create their own project, following some small steps from the teacher, there is a higher chance that the student will get the project done rather than not complete it.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to assign and create their own projects. Many reasons include how big the project is, how much time it will take, and how much time the student can work on it. So to make it easier on everyone, students should be able to make their own projects that can revolve around their own lives and responsibilities.Â",

      "Summer is the time of year where students all over the world finally get to relax. They do not have to worry about any responsibilities; they can just remember what it means to be a kid. However, some schools are allowed to assign projects over summer. If kids are required to constantly be thinking about school and work, they should at least be enjoying it. Students should self design any projects assigned over summer because its their own free time, everyone has unique learning styles, and teachers aren't always considerate.\n \n Children care about their summer vacations, because it is the only time they are truly free. A student looks forward to this vacation throughout the whole school year. They wait patiently, completing every assignment and every test, just so they can play outside in the summer sunshine. These kids don't want to finally get out of school to only have to complete yet another assignment. If the kids are having to do this project on their own break, they should at least be able to choose what they do. For example, if a student is assigned a project over summer from biology, they should be able to pick to do an animal studies on their own dog. An animal they know well, love, and actually would enjoy researching. Kids having to spend their vacation working should be able to choose what to work on.\n \n Kids want to play, so they should be able to and have a project that adapts to their learning style. Every student learns differently. Having a project created by one teacher would be unfair to everyone else who doesn't think the same way. Allowing students to have some decision in what they do would be most effective in actually teaching them. Every mind learns differently and needs creative thinking involved to begin working. If kids were allowed to come up with their own projects, it would be much better than a teacher-designed project. The kids would not think of it as homework, but instead as something they want to do.\n \n Teachers don't always know whats best for their students. Many teachers may just assign homework because they need more grades in the grade book. They don't always consider if it's necessary for the students learning. They don't think about the stress that homework inflicts on it's victims. If teachers were to create a project for students to complete over summer, it would cause lots of stress and resentment. Although, letting the kids design their own projects would help build a better bond between kids and learning. Teachers would then get a better feel for each student and see how each of their individual minds work. Letting kids design their own projects would also reduce the amount of work and stress teachers have to endure. Having to come up with a project that would be easy for every student to complete is hard as it is. Having to do this before a teachers own vacation is just torture. It would be a win win situation if the kids got to design the project.\n \n If it was required that a kid got a summer project, it should be student designed. Kids are not thrilled about getting homework over their vacation, and they may not put their best effort. However, If the kids had the option to create their own project it would spark much more creativeness. Teachers would better understand their students and get a break from all the regulating. Both students and teachers would benefit from a student-designed project.",

      "Are students responsible enough to design their own school projects? Numerous schools require students to complete projects over the summer to ensure learning, but this method may be ineffective. If students were given the freedom to design their own projects it would lead to greater performance due to the likelihood that students will pick topics that interest them, that projects would be generalized to help students in the fields with which they require assistance, and the possibility of students forgetting about the project would be lower if they actively worked on it.\n \n However, some may disagree with this viewpoint. Some may say that designing their own projects provides students with an opportunity toÂ pick an easy topic with which they will not be challenged. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.\n \n Firstly, students, when given the opportunity, will always choose to work on a topic that interests them. Studies show that working with a topic that interest them improves the performance of students while also increasing the possibility of them making an effort to complete their work. However, this is not the only reason why students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Additionally, while some may argue that students would choose to work on topics which they find easy, the chance of a class of students all thriving in the same subjects is highly improbable. Due to the fact that some students will choose to work in subjects which they don't find challenging, students may end up choosing topics which challenge their peers and inadvertently create a project which is all encompassing. But these are not the only reasons students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Finally when any person puts considerable effort into something it causes information related to the subject becomes learned more easily. This is one of the reasons why teachers use methods such as taking notes to reinforce what students are learning. So, logically a group of students working together to choose a topic and subject which they are all satisfied with will reinforce the knowledge of such a project and therefore decrease the likelihood that students will forget about their summer projects thereby improving results.\n \n However, there are many more reasons that students should design their own summer projects.\n \n InÂ conclusion, students should have a hand in creating their own summer projects to choose topics which interest them, as well as to increase the likelihood of them completing said projects, and finally create a project in which all students may both thrive and struggle.",

      "Summer projects should be student-designed. No student likes to do projects in the summer, Students will require motivation and excitement. If students can design their own project, they can be different and more creative. Students enjoy tasks where there's no limit as to what they can do; it gives them the opportunity to try something new. This gives teachers less work and students a more thoughtful tasks. Overall, this will give students a reason to learn, even during they're break.\n \n This is a good way to assure students are still learning. It also gives the students more of a challenge and prepare them for the following school year. Students can use this as a way to see how they're doing and also to stay involved in school. If it were a teacher-designed project, most students wouldnt participate. Since the students are the ones designing it, it'll give them a little more excitement and control over the project.\n \n Students tend to work harder and be more creative when it is a self-designed project. This will open more opportunities and more ideas. Designing your own project gives students the freedom and control that they love. For example, the few times I've been able to design my own project I always put forth more effort and creativity; This is because students love to try different things and be in control. This is important because it teaches students valuable skills that they may need in the real world.\n \n If students are interested and have ideas, summer projects can be really beneficial. Allowing students to create their own project is a great way to interest them. Students tend to work best when they have their own ideas, it's a lot easier and gives the student more freedom. This can teach students to be more independent and hardworking.\n \n A project can show effort and knowledge, when students create their own it shows their best work. It allows students to show what they are capable of. That is why I believe students should design their own project. Â Â",

      "Throughout the school year, both staff and students await summers warm arrival. As the incoming heat and sunscreen draws the final semester to an end, the dreaded thoughts of summer projects spread. Whether it be summer-readings or instructional packets, several high schools urge, if not require, teachers to assign summer projects to assure continuous learning over the two month break. Recently, however, students have debated that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. Designing their own projects would allow students to pursue topics they interest, the creative freedom that makes their projects unique, and ensure each students ability to complete projects with the resources available to them.\n \n Often times students are required to complete a project they lack interest in. A 2013 study confirms that when students are given the opportunity to design individual assignments, they are 78% more inclined to participate and are confident of their final product. If a particular student is interested in basketball, they would be more willing to read a book and write an accompanying paper about its history rather than Mary Shelly's\n \n Frankenstein . A students eagerness to learn in specific topics strengthens their work and ensures their growth and success before the new school year.\n \n Equally as important as topic diversity is topic delivery. Reading a book and writing a paper confirming your completion year after year does little to stimulate a students brain. Offering students the creative freedom to complete their summer project will further invest them into their topic. Say a student is interested in film and designs their project on studyingÂ its evolution; instead of writing a paper, the student could make a video presentation featuring different clips and information. Allowing students to broaden their horizons will encourage critical thinking and result in a more stimulated head spaceÂ when returning to school.\n \n Another important consideration is whether or not students can access the necessary resources to complete a teacher-designed project. Several high school students are not fortunate enough to purchase a summer-reading book, supplies for a poster board, or the internet to construct a paper. When completing the project isn't a viable option, the opportunity to design their own allows them to use resources already available to them and avoid lowering their grade.\n \n Although student-designed summer projects are proven to aid learning in more ways than one, schools are still hesitant to make the shift. Teachers rebuttal saying teacher-designed projects would provide students with relevant prepÂ work for their next course and avoid any inappropriate topics that fail to exhibit student growth. Students agreed and offered to solve the inevitable conflict: students have the option of of either completing a teacher-designed project or designing and their own as long as it is teacher-approved prior to schools end.\n \n Maintaining academic activity is key to achieving higher grades and retaining long termÂ information. Even in the summer, students should practice this with assigned summer projects. Though teacher-designed projects aid a students transition into the next year, these projects can be repetitive and may struggle to entice or stimulate students. When students themselves design one, however, the passion for their topics, creative delivery, and avoiding any hindrance on unavailable necessities allow them to learn while still fulfilling what summer is all about: having fun!",

      "Summer break. The most sought after break by any student at any level. Days spent by the pool, hours of hanging with friends, and nights that run into the morning. Summer is where all knowledge learned during the previous year goes down the drain. To counter this, teachers assign summer projects. These projects are normally easy but require much time. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they prepare the student for the next year, the teacher knows what is being taught, and it gives the student a baseline of what he or she knows.\n \n Summer projects are designed by a teacher that the student will have next year. These projects need to incorporate what will happen in the upcoming year. Many first units include what was included in the summer project. Summer projects help student get ready for the new year by giving students an easy, slow paced, and minimal effort project that will help students in the long run. These projects are often worth points and can boost grades when quarters or semesters are ending.\n \n Teachers know what is being taught for the next year. They can design the assignment to reflect what will happen. Students can't do that. They don't know what is going to be taught or how the teacher teaches. If a student were to design the project, they would make it have little to no relation to the upcoming class. Students during the summer are lazy, I speak from experience, and the last thing they want to do is school work. When they design their own work, it is sloppy; lazy; and unrelatedÂ to the class.\n \n Lastly, the summer project gives an honest and unbiased evaluation of what the student already knows and what they don't know. The assignment is students' first test, and students can give themselves an honest evaluation of themselves. How much did I have to Google? Did I ask my friends for help? How long did it take me? These are all questions that they can ask themselves. These questions and project will show how much work they will need to put in during the school year.\n \n Some might say that students can prepare themselves betterÂ for the school year than the teacher can. They don't need to have the teacher to assign them work. The weakness in that argument is that students are over confident in their abilities on what the know and don't know. As a student in high school, I constantly believe that I am smarter than I truly am. Students will think they know more than they really do and will already be behind before the school year starts.\n \n Teachers design these projects to help and prepare the student. It gives an honest evaluation of students' abilities and knowledge. More teachers should assign summer projects to keep students' brains engaged. This helps them prepare for the next year while also seeing what the teacher wants. The teacher knows the subject better than the student; teachers should assign summer projects not students.Â",

      "Benefits of Student-designed Projects\n \n Summer projects are to keep students learning during summer break but most kids don't find the projects entertaining. Student-designed projects can improve their creativity and make them want to complete the project. Also, teachers will be more excited and looking forward to seeing the outcome of students work. Schools should really think about making more projects student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because more students will want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem.\n \n In schools, participation from students is very important and student-designed summer projects are a great way to increase excitement and participation. If students could come up with their own projects and enjoy the work that they are doing, plenty of other students will want to do the project. In addition, students will see their peers coming up with their own kind of project and will want to join in by making a project themselves. For example, a student can see one of their friends making a project and can tell that the friend is having fun while doing it. This will encourage the student to join in on the student-designed project and make them want to do the project more. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects can increase creativity throughout students. Projects already help with creativity but having a student design a project can really increase it. For example, my art teacher had the class come up with different ideas for our next piece of art work. There were so many creative thoughts going around that my teacher had us make our own unique thing. As I worked on the project, I could really see my creative side show and everybody else's too. Having students design their own projects for the summer is really good for the next school year. For instance, students developing and finding out how creative that can be will improve grades and talent. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Self-esteem is an important factor in the real world, having students design a project can help them improve their confidence. A student knowing that they completed a project, they've made, will make them proud of themselves. In addition, using the project in other classes, and getting recognized for designing a good project will drastically increase their self-esteem. Students-design summer projects will increasingly let students know that they can do any thing they put their minds too. Self-confidence will provide students with better outcomes, motivation and even they will feel more confident in the work they are putting out. In this paragraph, I proved that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Some opponents believe that teacher-designed projects should be used for summer projects. Also, they may feel as if it will be easy on students and a better way of learning. However, giving students a easy way isn't always the best thing to do. Having students design a project has better outcomes in the long run. For example, having a teacher design a project and give it to students may not help students become more creative or participate or even gain self-esteem from it. So, a teacher-design project for the summer, in my eyes, is not the best thing to have students grow and improve in certain positions.\n \n In conclusion, keeping students active and learning during the summer by having student-design projects has plenty of benefits. In addition, this can have a better impact on students as well as be more exciting and entertaining to students. Three benefits for student-design summer projects are it will make students want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.Â Â",

      "When we think of break, whether it's Spring, Summer or Winter, we tend to think of it as something where we can relax after a long period of work or school, however, during these breaks, many of us play sports, have jobs or preform other activities during this time off. It's important to keep in mind that many students preform various activities when discussing a summer assignment. Some schools offer up this assignments, that way students are able to learn during break. The question isn't whether summer assignments are necessary or not, because having prior knowledge going into a class is important, but rather the question is whether the summer assignments should be be comprised of questions made by teachers or questions made by students. Having questions created by students, will make the summer assignments much more useful.\n \n If you ask any student who pays attention in a certain class about the way they feel about that class, they're sure to give you a wide array of emotions that they felt toward certain topics or units. For example, if you ask a student their thoughts on unit 7, they are able to tell you if it was hard or easy and if it was on the difficult side, they would be able to tell you what kind of questions confused them. having this foresight is very important when creating questions, you are able to give other students more exercises for the questions you think are more difficult.\n \n Another reason why it is more beneficial for students to create summer assignments rather than teachers, is because teachers tend to over prepare students which could become damaging. \"Overprepare\" can mean that you know the bare minimum and more, which does apply to teachers summer assignments, however, knowing too much unnecessary information can make you forget important information. Overcrowding summer assignments with non vital knowledge can also be discouraging to students, and it will make them not want to attempt the work.\n \n Overall, having student created questions will benefit other students taking that class, because, at the end of the day, students understand what it's like to be a student. A student is not just a person who attends a form a schooling but an actual person. Students need time for sports, jobs they may have, or even just socializing and hanging out with friends. Other people who understand these struggles, should be the ones who ultimatley be in control of the questions.",

      "Summer break is the biggest part of the year that students look forward to. Students want to have fun with friends and just relax, however, students are still required to continue learning throughout their break in order to retain information they've learned over the school year. Consequently, students are assigned teacher-designed summer projects. Some people may say that teacher-designed summer projects are effective, however, student-designed projects are better because it would be more enjoyable for the students and it will have more diverse topics.\n \n First of all, having students design their ownÂ projects would be a lot more enjoyable for students because they have the freedom to choose their own topics. For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated.\n \n Secondly, letting students design their projects will lead to more diverse topics. Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions. In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic. This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from bothÂ sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other. Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another.\n \n Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students, however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education. For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or notÂ enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the freedom to choose and design their own summer projects because it'll give the students a chance freely express themselves. Students today have a lot of information thrown at them during the school year and having to retain all that information throughout summer is very difficult, but having students forcefully research and learn about a topic they don't like would be very discouraging and not very effective. Learning is an important part of life, but students should still have the freedom to research and work on something they want to do.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. A teacher-designed school project is a way to communicate with upcoming students through the introduction of the new curriculum. However, a student-designed project allows students to choose their own topic. The students would have complete control over their summer project, permitting them to prove what they are individually capable of. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to explore their own interests, it gives students more freedom to be creative, and is less stressful.\n \n Students should be able to design their own projects so that they can indulge themselves in matters that personally interest them. For example, students would put more effort into a project they are interested in, rather than one assigned to them. Researching topics that are unappealing does not encourage a higher quality outcome in an assignment. The freedom to explore other topics that are more personal and relatable gives students the power to prove they understand their project. Also, students have more freedom in their presentation. They are allowed to represent their knowledge through the projects in whatever form they believe fits best. This way, teachers are able to see work habits and the effort students provide in their project's display. Freedom in choosing their own topics truly allows students to learn about what they desire.\n \n Another reason in favor of student-designed projects is the capability of creativity. A personal project allows students to create their work however they see fitting. Students can design and display their summer's worth of research in their own creative ways. Students creating their own projects freely will provide better, more creative outcomes. In addition, teacher-assigned projects teach kids to follow a rubric and limit their own creativity. Students will put less effort into a project with specific guidelines because they are less interested and feel constrained to the task's specific guidelines. Developing their own projects allows them to be free-thinking, and provide a creative project that accurately represents their efforts. Student-designed projects allow for more creativity than teacher-designed projects.\n \n Finally, student projects are less stressful than a teacher-assigned project. For example, all students creating the same exact project encourages academic competition. Competing to create and develop a better project than friends and peers introduces more stress to students. A summer project should not be used to stress students, for the students will recieve unwanted and false ideas about the stress and workload of school. Also, unwanted stress can cause the students to cheat on or disregard their assignments. The pressure of a teacher-designed project could drive students to copy another students' work. Other students, who are notÂ engaged in a teacher-designed project, might completely blow off the project, and waste their summer unproductively. Stress drives students to make projects more trouble than they are worth.\n \n Student-designed summer projects are clearly a better choice than teacher-designed projects. Students are permitted to research and report on their own interests and what applies to them. Creativity in their projects is derived from the freedom to complete their work in their own way. Student-designed projects take away from the amount of stress added from teacher-assigned projects and their elaborate rubric and grading systems. A student's own project can display one's hardworking capabilities towards a set of academic goals.",

      "Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project.\n \n Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do.\n \n In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish ,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions.\n \n I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work.\n \n Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like.\n \n In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed.Â",

      "These summer projects should be student designed for sure. It shows which students who are willing to apply themselves and show how creative they are, which would separate them from the rest. This would in return create a bias with the teacher.\n \n If summer projects were designed in such a way where the student led their own idea with what to do with said topic, this would ulimtatly separate students from each other. I refer to this as \"the breaking point\". I refer to it as \"the breaking point\" because it shows which students who are willing to apply themselves, who are trying with mediocre effort or don't care at all. It builds discipline and character. If you are willing enough to take the extra mile and go out of your way to make this project the best ever, then that proves to your teacher that you are the one who wants it, you are the one to ask questions, you are the one to make it. Some students would probably set them selfÂ up for failure and try to find the easy way too workout around said project. All this shows is that they wish to take the wide path that life has set before us and not the narrow path with temptations that build that discipline. This project should be meant for who wants it, not for what its really on. It should basically be an assessmentÂ to see what level of goat they are on.\n \n Now there is a very great con to my argument. That con my friend has a name, and her name is, bias. With going with the plan on doing said project create a very huge bias within teachers. Once they see who was very willing to apply themselves and who wasn't, they'll most likely start to prematurely pick and choose favorites. I say this because they'll start to imagine how well this student will do in their class and how terrible the next would. Come school time, the kids won't know it, but the teacher already has a secret disliking for some of the students. It's to hell with them basically. It's hard for us students to overcome such a bias from a mistake we made. Even if we start acing the teachers class, they'll probably jump to conclusions and assume we have cheated all year or something. This project is a great cause with two possible outcomes: A great upbringing or a terrible downfall. But see, you might have though that I am swaying you away from actual argument but here's where the good comes in. This project brings out the teachers true character as well, we can see if the teacher is really loving as people say they are no matter what, or will their true colors show? This whole thing is one big assessment on everyone's moral values. Are you a fan or a hater?\n \n In conclusion, life is what it is. Bias or not, let the kids show who they are and who THEY want to be. Don't allow teachers to solely let the do what they want but instead let a student explore his mental. Let us breathe and thrive in life. Let us learn from our own mistake and not be carried on the shoulders of someone else. I would like to end this passage with a qoute I made myself.\n \n \"One can only achieve which he belives\"\n \n -Generic_NameÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

Teachers give students summer projects to make sure that we are still learning and not forgetting information that we already know and to keep working the students brain. I agree with teachers assigning students a summer project because it lets the students be creative and learn in a fun way.\n \n I agree that summer projects should be student designed because it will show what the students have learned and it would show what they need to improve on. Students will be learning more because the students would be researching to find information and they would learn new information. Students can learn and be involved with the project and it would raise your grade if it is low. If the student is bored and has nothing to do than they can work on the project.\n \n Also, students can be creative and design the project how they want to do it. Being creative is great because it lets the student show what they got and just have fun with it. Being creative can lead to positive thinking and makes the students feel like they can do it. Students love making projects how they want to and makes them think and brainstorm to see how they will make it look like they gave it all they had. Students love being creative and the students learn while being creative on the project and to show how much potential the students have in them.\n \n Some students find the topic they get for the project interesting and joyable. If students like the topic then they will do more research and learn and have fun with the project. Student designed projects will let the students have fun and research and learn about the topic and let the students explore. Student designed projects will be better for the students and let them show you what they learned and researched about and to let them show how creative they are. Students having teacher designed doesn't let them be creative and let them research and find information and to let them show what they have learned.

      "Summer vacation is a time of rest, relaxation, and recreation for public school students across the nation. However, this break is also well-known for creating significant academic setbacks for these students and causing them to struggle in their return to school. To solve this common issue, many schools have started to require their students to complete a summer project in order to maintain their academics outside of school. Although these projects would be more educationally beneficial for the students if constructed by the teachers, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to do a high-quality project are increased.\n \n To begin with, the summer break projects should be constructed by the students because they are more likely to enjoy the project. In today's society, many students enjoy creating things that they thought of themselves and were not assigned by a teacher or parent. Consequently, if these projects were created by teachers, the students would say that the topic that the teachers selected for the project was not interesting enough and would not be as motivated to complete the assignment. If these projects were created by the students, they would not feel forced to do the project. Instead, they would leave for summer vacation already anticipating starting this fun and exciting new activity. In conclusion, schools should allow students to create their own summer project because the students are more likely to enjoy it.\n \n In addition, the allowance of a student-constructed summer project would increase the probability of completion by the students. If the students are permitted to complete a project of their own invention, their motivation to do it will increase because they are guaranteed to enjoy the topic of the project. Teacher-constructed projects are not likely to suit the interests of each of their students. This results in a percentage of the students not enjoying the topic of the project, losing motivation to do what was assigned, and eventually not completing the project at all. This can be avoided if the topic of the summer project was student-selected because each student would be doing something that they are interested in. To conclude, students should be allowed to select their own summer project instead of the teachers selecting it because their motivation to complete the project is guaranteed to increase significantly.\n \n Finally, schools should permit students to pick their own summer project because the chance that students will construct a project of higher quality will increase. Students completing a project that they are interested in are proven to spend more time and effort on their assignment. Forcing students to construct a project that they are not interested in is the easiest way to receive a low-quality project. In order to prevent students from creating an unambitious and lazily-made project, schools should permit students to choose what project they will be doing. This ensures that every student is doing something that they will be guaranteed to enjoy. To summarize, the allowance of student-constructed projects increases the probability that schools will receive high-quality projects on their return.\n \n In conclusion, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to complete a high-quality project are increased. The projects mandated by these schools will create a new generation of inquisitive and ambitious students. The students who complete these interactive and enjoyable projects are more probable to enjoy school on their return and have an increase in motivation and ambition regarding their academics. Allowing the students to construct these summer break projects instead of the teachers is the best possible decision that America's schools could ever make for the future generations of today's society.",

      "For many students, summer projects are a useless task forced upon them by their teachers. These assignments can be detrimental to the continuity of the students' learning. Without the freedom to stray from the normal, one may become expectant of nothing more. Student led assignments give highschoolers the opportunity to be creative in their learning, learn responsibility, and prepare them for the future.\n \n During the school year, students are expected to learn through the guidance of the teacher. While some people enjoy this structure, many feel their creativity is being repressed. A survey done on high schools students, asking about how they feel they have the ability to represent themselves through schoolwork, 75% feel that they do not have the option to express themselvesÂ with their current workload. With a self-led summer project students could continue learning through the break, by studying a topic that interestsÂ them which, in turn, inspires them to create a more thought out end result.\n \n Responsibility, a skill hopefully learned by students through school, is not easy to become proficient at. And with many teachers setting deadlines and giving extensions, students can lose responsibility without trial and error. A psychological study that followed five students' grades and work style throughout four years portrayed the effect that self-led projects had on students before they left for college. Teenagers who had no control over their learning, while seemingly successful with their grades, lacked development on the section of the brain that controls creativity and responsibility. However, students who worked with their teachers on their course of study had better developed this section. These skills not only help students grow as self-thinkers, but as responsible and thoughtful human beings.\n \n In many ways, the future for today's children is unlike the life they live now in school. There will no longer be someone to give them instructions for every task, and many projects are completely controlled and monitored by the person creating it. School is designed to prepare students for the real world, yet many findÂ themselves lost by the time they must complete their own study or presentation in college. While it may be difficult to recreate these circumstances in high school, a summer project gives students adequate time to thoroughlyÂ researchÂ and involve themselves in their project. One may find themselves discovering new topics that they were not previously aware of. Whereas without the freedom to follow their own direction, they would become trapped with the same topic and format as everyone else.\n \n Free thinking is an important skill to have once you're an adult, and student-designed projects support the formation of this skill. The opportunity to express themselves through their learning is essential to the development of useful, creative habits that can be extremely helpful for the future of the world.",

      "Summer break, a time for both students and teachers to get a few months away from the not so wonderful place we call school. While most schools allow students a complete break from doing work there are some who still want to continue the learning experience during those months off. These schools require students to do a summer project to ensure they continue learning and don't completely shut off their brains. The question retaining to this topic is, should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? My stance on this is, the projects should be student-designed being that this is their break from school and they are still being required to complete a project.\n \n Students need the freedom to choose what they want the project to be about. Even during the school year most projects are teacher-designed, the teacher always has things set up how they want it and all the projects end up looking the same. I personally don't know how many students would complete a full project over the summer anyway, but if they are allowed to design it and set it up themselves I think they will be more excited to complete the task. Students also deserve this freedom, I feel like so many times teachers restrict things or make things more complicated by giving the students no freedom. Also, by allowing students the freedom to design their projects many students will show more respect for their teachers in the future and be more likely to work harder on other other things they are required to do.\n \n Whether students choose to show it in the work they turn in to their teachers, they are all so highly creative. I feel that most students don't tend to show how creative they are because they don't like the assignment they are given or feel like the guidelines are too strict to fully express themselves. I think it's important for teachers to know what their students are capable of and see that they can really bring their best work forward when they allow students to have more control of a project. Creativity is a really great way to understand someone, if teachers allow the students to be creative then they will start putting more of themselves into the projects and teachers can really start to see what wonderful minds they all have. Students need to be able to express themselves in creative ways and one of those ways is by allowing them to design their own project.\n \n My final point I'm going to make is that even though some schools may want to continue the learning experience during the summer it is still the students summer break. The thing most students look forward to from day one of school is summer break and a good majority of those students definitely don't want to have to complete a school related project when they are away from school. But if it's a requirement then allow the the students to choose what their projects will be about. Most teachers don't do work over the summer cause that's their break as well so if students must be forced to complete a task then let them be in charge so they aren't completely miserable their whole summer.\n \n In conclusion, the required summer project that students have to complete should be student-designed. These students work hard for almost ten months and deserve a break without hard, restricted work their teachers assign. But, if it is a requirement they deserve to be in charge of it. They need to be allowed the freedom to create these projects as they see fit. Students are wonderful, creative people and need to be allowed to express themselves thoroughly so that teachers can see what theyÂ are capable of when they let them take the reigns and let their creative magic happen. After all summer break is supposed to be a time for them to relax and forget about school for awhile and they most certainly don't want a complicated project to work on so, I say, the students need to be able to design their own projects for sake of letting them enjoy their summer break.",

      'Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did notÂ know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, "I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scaredÂ to complete the test before the timer goes off becauseÂ I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakesÂ in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said "I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even thoughÂ you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focusedÂ and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the yearÂ I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projectsÂ teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy becauseÂ most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible.\n \n Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.Â',

      "Generic_Name is given a summer project by her teacher and is annoyed over having to do work over the summer, but once she actually starts the project she realizes it helps her remember material and comes to school feeling more prepared. A teacher gives students a project to do over the summer knowing exactly what the students need in order to continue learning and become prepared for the coming school year. Although receiving work to do over the summer for students may be bothersome, teachers understand the requirements students should meet in order to learn efficiently throughout the summer so that they will not forget important material. Teachers should be designing the summer projects rather than students themselves because they understand what material is needed to learn, they have a broader outlook on what all students can do, and they will provide a more challenging project.\n \n Although a student may argue that students should be the ones designing the summer projects because as a student, students will know what will be good for other students. Being the same age group may help in developing a project that will help other students learn over the summer but consequently that is not the case. Students are all different when it comes to learning techniques and when coming up with a project, it may either be difficult or too easy for other classmates. Work provided by students will vary in results and become unreliable. Teachers know what is needed to learn and therefore give students a summer projects that will be efficient enough to help students during the summer.\n \n In order to be prepared for the coming school year, students will need know what material is necessary to remember. Teachers know exactly what material be taught and need to make sure students do not forget basic information. When coming up with a project for students a English teacher will know which basic information is needed to remember, such as knowing basic vocabulary terms to distinguish while reading, Students will easily forget terms and struggle when coming back to school and needing to restudy these basic terms, it also takes away more time for teachers to teach. Teachers are the ones teaching the material and understand the necessitiesÂ students are gonna need to remember for the upcoming year.\n \n With that, to make sure students actually do learn, it is necessary that students are given a project that will be helpful for the majority. Teachers have the broader outlook on what exactly the majority of students should be learning and will help students learn over the summer that way they will feel more prepared for the coming school year. Teachers will ensure that by looking through test averages, seeing where students did worst and best at and reflect that on the summer project. By looking through what students did best and worst at teacher will provide a helpful project for the summer to make sure students learn in the summer. Students will have the lower hand in this situation because of lack of knowledge towards what other classmates did well and bad on.\n \n Summer projects will only help students learn if the project actually requires students to think and work efficiently. Teachers will be sure students are given a project they cannot just wing and do quickly. Teachers could give ESSAYs or book reports that way students will actually be more hands on and not lack off doing the summer projects. Giving students a more challenging or thinking based summer project will not only prevent laziness but will make the students feel more productive with their summer. The boost of productivity will give more confidence to the students as in something that could be too easy to quickly finish. Teachers understand that more thinking based work or more work will help students learn more efficiently and be more productive. Giving them a simple project or a project that involves little work will only increase the chances of students lacking off and therefore result in nothing being learned.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects are given to students so that they continue to learn in the summer and become more prepared for the coming school year. Whether or not these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, it is easier to say they should be teacher-designed. Teachers understand the material and the students and therefore will provide a more efficient summer project. When being able to understand what is required for a summer project, teachers will have the better understanding on ensuring the project will be efficient for students to learn.Â",

      "How would a student feel if they had to endure a lesson during the summer by a immature kid? Summer assignments have been implicated in student's daily lives since 7th grade. The theory is that if teachers provide students with a summer assignment, they will be ready for the classroom in the fall. However, there is a rise in the education department where they have to see if it is really benifical for the younger generation to have their assignments designed by a teacher or a student. The pratical answer for this discussion would be to have a teacher-designed summer assignment because it will prepare the students for their class, strengthn their abilities, and open their eyes to what the future would look like going into higher education.\n \n Learning the material by someone who is already trained in this profession will help prepare the students for the year since the teacher is the one who is going to help them get a wide range of education. It will be more benifical if the students learn this way because its going to get them ready for the year. For example, if a math teacher gives a student a summer project that they designed they will already have a planned idea of what is going to be in the next school year. This will let the young adults see what they will be doing in the following school year which in turn can help the student understand if this class is the right clas for them.\n \n Not to mention, if the summer assignments were teacher-designed it will give the students the oppurtunity to learn more about their strengths and weaknesses. In the school system more than 85% of the school's population have struggled in one or two subjects. Moreover, that means students will have a harder time grasping certain subjects when the school year begins. If the assignments where created by the teacher then they will have an easier time at the beginning of the year to understand what the student is struggling with. Moreover, it could also help the student by getting the student to think more about what they struggle with and how they can grow upon it since it is an independent project.\n \n However, since it is a summer assignment, students would not be as motivated to do the work since it is an extended amount of time ot do a minimal activity. As teens go into summer they do not worry about the summer assignment and get this feeling of procrastination with the certain activity. 95% of teens around the world struggle with this thought and wait until the last minute. Which could be damaging to the students education.\n \n Since procrastionation occurs it would be more likely for students to cheat. However, making the assignment teacher designed and giving it time stamps of when it is due during the summer will force students to deal with time managment. Moreover, if we allow our children to be interactive with teacher-designed assignments, then they will be more prepared for the future. For example, if an english teacher decides to make a summer assignment and put certain due dates during the summer rather then giving them a student-designed activity; It will give the student a chance to learn about what it means to have responsibilities. Which is important because it will make sure that students can be independent with their jobs.\n \n The debate on whether or not summer assignments should be designed by a certain person has shown the community what really is important in this society. Our educators wanna make sure that the students will be prepared for what is coming to them, especially if they are taking an AP course. Moreover, it will shine light to some of the weaknesses in a student early on so the educator can help them with this skill. Likewise, it can also make the young adults open to ideas of having important responsiblities so they will be ready for the workforce. No matter what occurs in life, educators should make sure that they are guiding the new generation to a bright and happy future.Â",

It is also important for the teacher to have it planned because they would have all the work needed on the project.\n \n When the teachers plans it out it would be more organized. It is also better for the teacher to have it planned; because they can see where the students need help when they have completed the project.\n \n Teachers would know what information is needed to help the student learn ,and get them ready for the upcoming year. When the teacher has all the work needed on the project; the student wont have to worry and look upÂ what they need to study. This is important because it gives the teachers the information to see what their students are struggling in ,and plan ahead for the year. When the information is laid out for the student it would be more: organized to do their work, more efficient, and gives them a heads up to see what their struggling in. This will also be easier on the teacher when they have the project ready for the students because it gives them an idea how to gradeÂ the project.\n \n The summer projects would be best if the teachers design them. Thats because when students are on break; they would get to lazy and not even want to start making a project for school. Also the student might even forget to design it on their own. Thats why when the teacher has it already designed; they can email their students, and remind them to work on the project that is already made for them. Another reason why the teacher should design the projects is, it gives the students time to be kids and have fun. Also it gives the students more time to enjoy their break with their family and friends.

Most students like to travel over the break and sometimes they can't do it abroad and don't have much time when they come back. For example: \"I went to El Salvador with my father and he lives in the country side, in his house he doesn't have wifi but does have cable. Coming back I only had five days to do it before I had to go back to middle school.\" Students wouldn't be able to do any school work because they could probably not have internet access and want to enjoy their time visiting.\n \n Students can design their project and making it easier by doing: a summary over a couple of simple novels, do a short ESSAY over a easy and simple prompt, do research over patterns in nature like, looking at moon patterns for two weeks or observe temperatures for a period amount of time and do a study on it when they come back. For example: \" I had a simple project to recorded what the moon looked like at night, every night for a week and draw it. This was easy and simple for me to do and i still learned a lot from it from observing that the moon slowly phases through each night through its cycle.\" Even doing small simple projects, students can still learn and discover new things because they don't have to stress about it and its something most students should be able to do.\n \n Someone might say, Teachers select projects that they think is good for students and it's better for a teacher to have control over it because they know their students best, expects them to do their best, accomplish it and that challenging them is good so they don't forget what they learned; however, that's not the case, really what teachers don't know sometimes, and what makes students have a hard time or take a long time on projects is that, teachers want to assign projects to what they think their students can do and put them at a challenging level or a process that takes a long time but students want to have it simple over the summer has they don't have class with other students and don't meet their teachers anymore so they can't ask for help. Students don't need to stress out over the summer by what their teachers assign, letting students decide lets them be creative and discover with what they chose to do.\n \n In conclusion, Student-designed projects, will encourage and help students with work and still learn from it as the teacher wanted for them to learn in the students own creative way.",

      "Is not three months of summer break a very long time to stay away from school work? The summer break is very discussed by people because for some, it is a very long period were people can relax and take a break from the school season. Some students prefer to plan an own program to refresh some topics and other prefer to have a program designated by the teachers. Altrought complete summer projects designed by the teachers for a school purpose during the summer break could dissappoint a lot of students, the teachers know which topic the students have to focus on, and be ready to go back in school as better as possible, for the next school year.\n \n Having a big vision of the development that the student did during the year, the teachers are the best individuals to assign project to work on and refresh on what has been done.\n \n In this case, student have a complete plan to work on and view where they have problems or concerns and be able to get feedback from the teachers. They do not have to spend time in researching in which topics they want to focus, havind a designed plan that cover most of them. Doing the entire work assigated, students could get more confidence and be prepared for the next year. Baing more prepared for the next year, they could take advanced classes and get more credits from it.\n \n The students who complete the entire practice could get a grade for the project itself and another one for the partecipation. This poiunt could could involve students in be active during the summer doing the project designated by the teachers reciving feedbacks and a starter grade for the next year. The teacher giving assignated projects could even give some prequerisits for the units that they are going to go over and do not lose time on them during the beginning of the year.\n \n Complete assigments and project during the school break is the best way to restart the next school year. Infact it could prevent a lot of time that usually is spent on reviewing the previous school program. The teachers are the people that most know about wath the students are going to study the following year, so they can designed the right assignement to focus on during the break.",

I feel as it should be teacher designed because some people wouldn't know what to come with, It would make it easier because they are more familiar to teacher designed assignments, and most students wouldnt do it because its not teacher designed.\n \n First, most students would feel as it's easier because it's teacher designed and thats what they are familiar to. For example, The teacher gave us students designed projects and we really didn't know what to do. So when the time came for us to turn it in, the class really didn't get a good grade.\n \n Another reason, is some people wouldn't know what to come with. In this movie i've watched the teacher had assigned projects to certain groups and this one group couldn't think of anything. So they went to each others houses and would think about what they should do and before they knew it, it was time for the project to be turned in. The next day had came and the teacher put in the grades they all had zeroes. It could have benefits though because assigning students designed projects it can help them later on in life, they could get a job where they have to do the designing.\n \n Finally, most students wouldn't do it because it wasn't teacher designed and they were being lazy. Since they had to do more work they would be lazy and wouldn't do it. I know other students and including myself, that didn't do an assignment because it wasn't teacher designed and we had to do more work and think more. So most of got zeroes.\n \n Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continue learning during the break. Should the assignments be student designed or teacher designed.

      "In many schools today, teachers assigning school projects over the summer for students to complete has become quite apparent. Teacher are doing this to have students stay focused even during the summer. Teachers can give one of two assignments; either a teacher specific assignment where every student has to complete roughly the same project with roughly theÂ same outcome that has very little room for variation, or they assign a student ran assignment that allows the student to do a project in something they have interest for and it can be quite personalized. Teacher projects usually are stricter in there guidelines and make the student typically work harder even if the student may not want to do that much work while student driven projects can have many students work extremely hard on something they have passion for. The only problem is you will usually have a slacker in student designed project that will always do the minimum. I see student projects to have better benefits for students as for those that want and enjoy putting in the work for something they are really interested in they will see more accomplishment out of that. Others may that teacher designed projects are better because they force ever student to work but they are wrong because the drive for success should come from the student not the teacher. Summer student designed projects are better for the student that teacher designed projects because it allows for students to take part in the design process and then execute a product of something that a studentÂ is generally interested in.\n \n Summer projects or studying in the summer will always be super beneficial for your education. It allows for you to stay alert and prepared for the next school year. Just studying in the summer alone can make getting into the next year that much easier. Summer projects can be really beneficial to students. In some cases it can allow students to have more a variety in options for there project than doing one in the school year. For example; a teacher assigns an entire class to do a research project on a single type of invasive plant species prevalent in his/her state and they will have to present that in class at the beginning of the year. I take issue with this because it is quite restrictive on what the student can research as its limited to only one plant you can do, and many students will likely pick the same plant. Plus the students have very little do in terms of the creative process in how they want to gather data. If I were the teacher I would have given a project on invasives in the state(allowing for multiple plants to be studied.)and not limit it to just a research project. This allows for a students to really to be flexible and learn more. Students can now have the opportunity to organize community events for conservation. Students can make test plots at a park to see what removal method works best. Students can now study multiple plants at once to compare and create statistics and find out which are the most deadly and hard to remove. Students also have the choice to help with college students on finding new ways of removing said plant from our area and eventually at the state level. Students can also go really indÂ depth into a plant they find super interesting and they can find the true science as to why they continue to grow so fast. The possibilities are endless.\n \n They best part is when it comes down to the presentation. It is very likely that majority of students will have different projects; some may have similar ones but very different findings so its really interesting to see a students, growth, trial, and success through the process of completing the project. While also talking about their final conclusion they should also discuss about how they changed in grew as a person and about what skills they earned that they can use later in their life. Students can truly learn new concepts off of other students. If students were tasked with completing the teacher created project, the majority of students would really not have learned as much from each other.\n \n This was only an example. The possibilities for student lead/created projects are endless because in comes from the student. The example mentioned was limited to conservation but there are student projects have to be. There are projects that can allow students to really branch out and potentially inspire them to their future careers. Students designed projects give students the chance to be a leader and be of something meaningfulÂ to them personally. Anyone can complete a project when it comes from a teacher but if it comes from student it can really create growth. These students will have plenty of time to complete their project as the have an entire summer to do so. The summer should not be a stressful time but it shouldnt be a time slack off and not grow in your learning. Everyday we are learning. Maybe its time for you to help someone else learning. Student designed projects give students the chance to prepare themselves for future challenges in the adult world. Others say that student designed projects dont push students enough to really create a product worthwhile; they are wrong because if a student truly care they will go above and beyond to see the it is completed full to the best of their ability.

      "Some schools require summer projects for students; these projects need to be student designed. When teachers plan a project some students don't enjoy completing the assigned task. For students to learn they have to be interested in what they are doing. There are many ways to assign a school project, it could be hands on, writing, individually, in groups etc. Each student has different skills, they should do a project that best fits that skill to succeed. Summer projects need to be student designed so that they are more motivated to complete the assignment, to have fun with the assignment and to have interest in the task.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to enhance motivation. When students are motivated this encodes the topic in their memory. When students are motivated they get better grades, the project is better quality and students do the project to their best ability. As a student when a project gets assigned and I am not interested in the assignment I try to get it done as quickly as possible and put no effort into it. I end up getting a lower grade. Students will also want to keep working on the project if they are motivated to complete it. With more time spent on the project this equals better quality and higher grades. Students won't procrastinate if the project interests them and will be motivated to start the project early. As a student in High School lots of students procrastinate when given a project. If projects were student designed this would motivate them to learn about the topic.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed so that they have fun with it. If they had fun with the assignment then they would have a memory of their experience. If schools made learning fun they are more likely to remember the topic of the project. If students were in a group for the project this would enhance team work skills if they had fun. As a student I found out that if I had fun learning about a certain topic I remember it more clearly and can connect it to other things in life.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to have students have interest in the topic. This would help students explore their interests that they never knew they were interested in. This may help students what they want to do after graduation. Chances are if a student is really interested in what they learned in class then they might explore that topic outside of school. When I had a project assigned to me that I was interested in I enjoyed completing the project and continued to learn more about it outside of school. Summer projects that have students interested is a key to success in their academic career.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects need to be student designed so that they look forward to working on the assignment, enjoy completing the task and continue learning about the topic outside of school. Some people say that projects should be teacher designed they are wrong because students then dont get the freedom of doing what they enjoy most. It also isn't equal to all students. For example, a teacher assigns a research paper on a certain topic, some students have a love for writing and it is their strength and others don't like to write. This is why student designed projects are important.Â",

While some would prefer a teacher designed project, student designed projects lets students chose their own topic, experiment the way they want, and present it the way they want.\n \n Student designed projects lets students chose any topic they want. I love it when I get to chose my own project because I can research any of my desired intrests. Chosing my own topic also motivates me to get the project done; for that, I am a curious person. Any project should let students chose their own topic.\n \n Students should experiment any way they want. When I was a freshman in highschool my science teacher let experiment any way we wanted; I built a solar panal that followed the sun. That project let me have lots of fun and made me be crative. Student designed projects lets students expeiment in thier own way and have fun when their doing it.\n \n Presentations should be apeling and informative to the reader. When I design a project I like to make the project the most crative and informative. Most teaches just say to make a power point or an ESSAY, but that doesn't show any crativity. Student designed projects lets students present how they want to present and let them be as crative as thay want.\n \n Some might like teacher designed projects because students do not have to think of a project; however, student designed projects let students chose thier topic, experiment however way they want, and present the way they want. Summer project should be fun and crative because it is student's break from school. Most student projects are fun, crative, and gives students freedom.",

      "AlthoughÂ many teachers designing their own summer projects for the students, the students should be designingÂ their own summer projects. Students they chose their own topic and design their own project willÂ be more interested in what they are learning. Also the students would be more likely to actually do the project if it is something they have interest in, and the students would have more say in what they are learning if they got to design their own summer project.\n \n If students were allowed to design their own project they would be a lotÂ more likely to actually do the project. Most students rather be with friends or on vacation during summer, rather then staying inside and working on a paper for school in two months. If the student designed the project it would be something that they might actually want to do or find interesting, not just something they were told they had to do the last day of school for that year. I know when I'm on vacation I like to do what I want to do and not be followed around by all the school I have to get done. So if it feels less like school work and more like a project that you want to do in your free time the students might actually do it.\n \n Letting the student have a say in the design of their project helps them get more involved with their learning and education. If you just et a teacher tell them what to do they will get bored with learning and not be interested and learning new things, but if they got a say in them project they could get involved and actually enjoy learning. I know from my life experiences I hadÂ a lotÂ more fun learning when I had a say in what I got to learn, such as me joining the Fire Department. When I joined it was a lotÂ of self assigning tasks and learning on your own time and at your own pace. When I got the chance to work with the people that where teaching me and have a say in what I learned and when I got a lot more into what I was learning and applied myself a lot more then I usually do in school.\n \n A student is way ore likely to do a project that actually interests him or her. A teacher can just pick a random topic without even thinking if the students will find it interesting. If the student is not interestedÂ in the topic it just makes it that much harder for them to pay attention and stay focused on the topic. When you are forced to learn about something that doesn'tÂ interest you it is harder to learn that topic. You have to do it all the time in schools such SOL's. You learn about something in school that does not interest you so the state will give you a label of smart or not smart even if you are just not interested in the random topics they pick to say they have taught you something. If it is a project that is to be done over summer vacation, let it be something that the student might actually enjoy and want to do. The student can easily just blow of the project and then start the next year in a bad spot because he or she is already behind on the first day of school and that is setting them up for failure for the rest of the year.\n \n Although teachers liking to design their summer projects for the students, the students should design their summer project. Have the project follows certain guide lines so it is still some what attached to what the students learned in school. Having the students get involved with their education is good for a lot more than just school, it can help them in the real world too. Students would learn more about something that might interest them if the student designsÂ their own project.Â",

Teachers should be the project designer because teachers can list all the wed-sites and information you need to complete the project. Students wouldn't have the right tools to be a project designer.

      "Over the summer, the majority of students will forget the core lessons they learned; therefore, some teachers decide to give students summer projects to keep information fresh in their minds. There is an ongoing debate over whether teachers should choose the summer projects for students, or if the assignment should be the ideas of the student themselves. There are those that say that it would be better for teachers to assign their own project, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.\n \n There are a variety of reason why students should create their own summer project. First and foremost, it inspires creativity. When a teacher assigns their own cut-and-paste project, this removes most creativity from the assignment. Students need to practice creative skills, and the low stress environment of summer is a perfect time for doing that. Additionally, students having their own project idea allows them to do what they want to do. This is obviously beneficial because the student can choose the subject that they are best at, which will improve the quality of the summer project. Also, giving the student the choice on what they want to do makes the project enjoyable, which is important considering that it is summer break. Finally, allowing students to assign their own project ideas motivates the student to actually do it. It is very common to witness teachers giving direct instructions on how the class should do something in a certain way, only for the students to lose interest. On the other hand, giving students their own unique project can inspire them to complete it with actual effort.\n \n There are additional reason why students should create their own summer projects. For instance, the student can use real world examples that they are familiar and can easily understand. Most teachers, especially ones in larger schools, will not know the student's personal interests and experience very well. Students can take inspiration, data, and ideas from their surroundings during the summer, which can make for an excellent project. Another reason students should design their own summer projects is that it creates less stress for the teacher. If students are making their own projects, it will make the job of teachers easier since they dont have to create unique prompts for each student. Additionally, each student having their own personally crafted project will get rid of the possibility of cheating, something they have would have if students were all to have the same assignment. Lastly, students creating their own summer projects will prepare them for the future. In college, many assignments given by your professor will be self directed, meaning you will need practice in creating your own ideas for projects. Careers also rely on creativity, innovations need to be made for more efficient work, which can earn you promotions.\n \n Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects. This is the case due to less overall stress, motivation for students, and inspiration for creativity and innovation. There are those that say teachers should design the project for the student because the teacher knows what the student needs to learn, what the school board wants, and what the student will learn the following year, but this is not the case. It's true teachers need to encourage creativity in and outside the classroom, but students also should enjoy their summer break after a hard school year.Â",

      "Summer assignments are important to help students continue learning over the summer. This is why these assignments should be designed by teachers, rather than students. This is due to the fact that teachers are going to assign challenging projects, which most students would not; additionally, teachers may use this assignment as a way to prepare the students for the following year.\n \n Everyone wants to enjoy their summer break, go on vacations, and chill at the beach. Summer assignments are a great way to put a pause on the fun. Knowing this, students are not going to purposefully give themselves a challenging project that could benefit them in the long run. They would create assignments requiring the least amount of effort and time in order to get back to playing videogames or tanning on the beach. This defeats the purpose of the summer assignment because an easy project that does not challenge you will not continue your learning throughout the summer.\n \n Additionally, this may be a great opportunity for teachers to help prepare students for the type of assignments they will be recieving the following school year. Students are unaware of what to expect, so they cannot prepare themselves adequately. Teachers have also been with these same students all year and know what they are good at, and what they need to work on. Assigning them a summer project may help these students work on their weak points, and gives them plenty of time to improve before the next school year.\n \n Some may argue that if students are not actively trying to challenge themselves, then they are only hurting themselves. However, many students likely are not sure what type of project would benefit them best, or are unaware of what they need to work on to improve. They also likely assume that they do not need to be challenged or believe that they are already prepared for the next school year.\n \n Overall, students would benefit more from teacher-designed summer assignments. Teachers know what students need to be prepared for and where their weak spots are. Often times students are unaware of how to help themselves improve.

The teachers already gives us alot of assgiments that are dessigned by teachers and their department maybe for once its time to give us a chance to let the projects be on us and up to our knowledge , even though the summer is really suppose to be about our summer vacation because we did just come from school and finished our requirements, the summer is really just a break for student to relax and getting your mind off school but I do agree that we should still do work and try to at least read once in a while so we dont go back to school during end of August or Septmeber and we clueless, reasons of why the summer projects should be student designed is because students may have ideas that teacher dont think about giving and belelive it or not these students can be very creative sometimes and come up with really excting ideas for projects with that being said they should be school educational wise , with the purpose of the summer projects being designed by students it's a better way of showing the teachers and the school education department that we have been learning in school what we need to know for an example when a student is doing their assignment and they include , context clue , details , strong vocabulary words and the unit basis of what we have learned in school. Coming to the next grade level it will show teachers that so far we have learned the right curriculum and the reached the standards because it will be presented in that presentation or that project assignment by the students who are doing it on their summer vacation however , if it were to be teacher designed because teachers are looking for specific portions of what they have learned during out the school year and on books they have read then I would understand why it would be that way even thought its taking out the purpose of a students own ability to do work on what they want to work on like me being in that position I would absolute take student designing the summmer projects for an answer.\n \n I would brianstorm with all my ideas for example ; the way i used math this summer when i went out and helped my father at his job because his back was injured i can definetly write out how i used some math learining skills and I can also write out the trips i went to and wrote ESSAYs about how it went and the stops we made thats a skill of writing and perhaps even reading , the more vacations and trips the longer my ESSAYs can be , of course it has to be educational wise so i will add some puncuations and maybe even the vocabulary that i learned during english class , it will show that not only do i remember what i was doing in school but I will also be preparing myself for next year I will have more practice and knowledge and try to fit in a litte bit of history in there as well like what's going on with my family and the government and how my grandma is sick so we trying to bring her here to stay with us for a while but because of the new rules in the United States , there's just some things we aren't allowed to accomplish no matter how bad we want her here and take care of her , I can definently make a project in how the government has these new rules that affects others and their familes like mine , that would be a example of me being in the postion as to it being student designed so I can personally write about how my life is going with that being said I would have to make the projects relate to school and the things we learned and of course that can be easy because there's alot of things we learn in school that can help us out later in life and when we look at a situation we see the things we been taught to prepare us in becoming adults I still til this day come home telling my parents something new that I've learned and at least try to help like when my mother lost her job and I was sitting in econ and finance and listening to my teacher tell us the things we can come off of when your in a situation like my mother when she was fired and was on a contract but because the business was low my mom was took out , teachers teach you alot about life and how you want to be ready and some students take it as a joke and others think into it and see a lot of sitiations like it when they come home and their parents having their own problems those are things we learn in school and when we have a chance to decide on our ideas. I think it's best as coming up with good thoughts on how around the places you travel or even in your own household there is school knowledge.\n \n things we learn in school students can relate to and may or may not affect them at home . When we're out of school we go home and have a long summer break and as we start to think of the things we've been taught in school we living in it and that's our future , that being said I do think students should be giving the opportuinty to decide on what they want to present there project on in the condtions of it being school educational purposes and to show how they not forgetting what students learning in school. A project in the summer especially when it's our free time, our vacation, it's time to let us students show the teachers what we know and learned from them and how we can relate to it when we are actually living in it, when we learn in school we have all this knowlege and the standards in each subject we're being taught gettting us ready when we become adults ourself. letting it be teacher-designed will only cover what a teacher expects from us.

Students would have a chance to gain responsibility, be creative and make an easy grade.\n \n Firstly, giving students the lead way to design their project allows the individual to gain responsibility. The student would be obligated to make time for all the steps leading up to the final project, making them move their schedule around or cancel plans. This ties into being an adult, making sacrifices to get important things done. For example, a students gets a summer project, its a Friday night and his or her friends wants them to go out. Instead of being behind on the project from going out, simply saying no and staying in to miss out on the fun is a sacrifice to the student. Therefore, creating responsibility from the ultimatum.\n \n Secondly, letting students take lead way is the best option because it allows the student to actually be creative. Students get boring topics and assignments all the time, causing them to do poorly strictly because they dont find interest on the topic. However, giving students the free will design the project based on their interests while also being school related will definitely give a change in the result of the final project versus a random teacher designed project. For example, a teacher gives a random topic she designed to the student. The student gets a topic about plants, which the student knows nothing about while also having little to none interest about them. As a result, the student is not going to give their full potential on the project because they did not have interest on the forced topic.\n \n Lastly, letting students design their summer project will give students the ability to bring their grade up. By students being creative and going the extra mile to have a successful project will give them the the perfect opportunity to make a great grade. For example, while doing the summer project the students will have confidence in the topic. While doing research the student will know exactly what they want to look for and even have a small plan on how they'd like the final outcome of the project to be. Resulting in a confident, well putÂ together project.\n \n However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be. However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer.\n \n In result, when summer rolls around and summer projects are assigned, letting students get the opportunity to design their project gives them responsibility by making simple or grand decisions, an open door to the students creative limits, and also makes great pay off from all the hard work and dedication gone into the project. So next time a teacher assigns a boring topic, students should take the lead and make a astonishing grade.",

      "Most schools require students to complete a summer project to make sure that students are still expanding their knowledge while school is closed. These summer projects are long, uninteresting, and tiring. Most students refuse to complete a summer project. Summer projects should be made into something that students would want to do and enjoy doing. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be creative, students can pick an assignment that is best for their knowledge capability, and students become more intrigued with their assignment.\n \n Typically when summer projects are assigned from a teacher, they're similar assignments. When summer projects are similar, they attend to make all students the same and strips away any originality. Students need to be able to show their individuality through their work. Research shows that when students choose their assignments, they exceedÂ by forty-five percent more than a teacher-assigned assignment. Creativeness is something that should be essential to students because that it was forms them as a whole and makes them unique to themselves. Each summer project would allow students to express themselves in ways that a teacher-assigned summer project can't. Creativity is something that is with-in a person and something that should never be taken away from an individual.\n \n Students come in variety, from ethnicity, gender, age, and most importantly in this case, teaching perforations. Students will learn a lot better if they were allowed to pick their own assignments because they could create a summer project that is perfect for their learning pace. For example, I observed that when I am completing an assignment that is not too fast or not too slow for me, I do better tremendously. Summer projects are so horrific already, at the very least students should be able to decide what is best for their learning capacity. Pacing would set students up for great improvement and succession.\n \n Students will become more interested in their summer project. Most students will not complete or do well on something that they are not interested in. An article stated that, because students are so young, and their brain has not developed yet, their attention span is very short. Meaning that students will not focus on anything for a very long time, especially something that is boring and has no significance to them. Evidence also shows that each year the passing rate and or completion rate of summer projects never exceed or increase, the rates always decrease. Students will be intrigued with their work if its assigned by them. If teachers keep assigning summer projects then the passing rate of the summer projects will continue to decrease, students need to stay interested and the most important way to have that happen is to allow them to choose their own summer project assignment.\n \n Summer projects need to cater to students to cause improvement. Students do not require much to be successful,teachers just have to have the ability to allow their students to be flexible with their work. It is important that teachers grasp knowledge of how important it is that a student remains creative,that a student can pace themselves,that students remain intrigued, and most importantly students become successful with their summer projects. Summer projects are a wonderful idea but being student-assigned is way better.",

      "When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project.\n \n A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself.\n \n When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing.\n \n School can stress a lot of children out. Making them continue doing work can add on to their stress if it is something they feel incapable of doing. Giving students the choice of designing their project can give them the benefit of the doubt, because the project is still what the school wants but just at the rate of what the student can do. Stress should not be something a school wants their students to have.\n \n Summer break is the time for students to enjoy themselves. Students should at leastÂ have the choice on how their project is designed. All year the teachers had a say on what their work would consist of. The students should have a project they could enjoy doing, and not feel forced to do a project they would have a hard time on. If they have to have a project it should be something they do not stress over, but something they are confident in doing. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Throughout my adolescent past, I've had a vigorous number of summer assignments. Whether it was a Algebra 1 packet or a summer reading assignment, teachers never fail to overwhelm there students with work before the year even begins. Most summer assignmentsÂ are enforced by the teachers and lack any student input. A majority of students show little interest in the assignments they are presented and approach the work with a negative attitude rather than optimism. Although a student-designed summer project is a chance for students to exhibit there work in a more enjoyable fashion, a teacher-designed project would work better because teachers understand what work will best prepare students and shows the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.\n \n A reason why teachers should design the projects is because they understand what work will best prepare students. Many teachers have attained an advanced education in there subject. Unlike the students, the teacher knows exactly what the course will consist of, and the level of difficulty that they will cover. In most classes, students start the year with no prior knowledge of the subject they will cover. An example of there unpreparedness is that large portions of high school students switch out of classes because they don't know the level of the work that they will be covering.Â A student led project could be void of any important information. If they find an area of the subject thats more difficult than the others, they could address that area more than another part of the subject.Â Assignments created by teachers would be a prime opportunity for teachers to demonstrate the work they will cover, and help a student drop the class if the work seems too challenging. A summer assignment is before the year starts, so switching your classes wouldn't interrupt your school year.\n \n Another reason teachers should design the projects is because it shows what type of assignments will follow in the future. Teachers are a people of habit. Throughout the year, they will assign projects that are very similar to each other, following similar guidelines. An example of repetition in school is teachers assigning a variation of slide show presentations. Throughout the school year, many teachers conduct slide show presentations within new concepts. If a student were to design the summer project, it could be an entirely different format then any format suggested by a teacher. With the teacher in control, they could give you a project very similar to one that you may face in the future.\n \n Many believe that if enjoy what your doing, than you will be more productive. A student getting to choose what type of project they will do could introduce the topic in more exciting manner. While enjoying what you do is important, it may also not prepare a student to the best of it's capabilities. A student led project may not cover the ground that it needs to cover. For example, the students could decide to write a one paragraph reflection on an area of the subject that they found interesting. The problem with that format is that it may only tackle a small portion of the subject, and you wouldn't be able to reflect on what others found interesting, which would help you remember the information better.\n \n The teachers should design the project that the students work on. They know what work will best to prepare students and help them succeed. Teachers understand the subject far greater than any student designing the project. A more rigorous area of the subject could be addressed more in the project. If the teacher creates all of the future projects, than the summer project could reflect the type of projects teachers will assign in the future. Repetition is prominent within classrooms, and a summer assignment created by the teacher could offer incite into future projects. With a student in control of the project, they may only address a small area of the subject that will come up later in the year. While a student-designed summer project can make there work more enjoyable, a teacher-designed project would be better for students, because teachers understand what will prepare them best and is a way to discover the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.Â  Â",

      "Should students really be making the summer projects? Students making the summer projects would help the students focus more on the project, help make the project less stressful, and could figure out a way to involve their family.\n \n If a student designes a project they are going to make sure it interests them. They aren't going to make it something they dont want to do. Some might say the students aren't going to know what information to learn and use in the project. If teachers work with students they can figure out a way to make sure that they students learn all the information they need to. Teachers can even give them a rubric with all the information the students need to use.\n \n When you are doing something that you enjoy you stress about it less. Especially when you're on summer vacation doing a summer project is the last thing that you want to be doing. Kids would much rather hang out with friends or play video games. If students are designing the projects they will design something that is less time consuming or more easy to manage . While some agree with this others are concered that students would make the project too easy. Teachers at the end of the day are assigning the project, they can put guidelines and expectations on top of the students project design.\n \n During summer vacation lots of students will travel and go places with family. Students can figure out a way to involve family members making the project easier to do on the road. Having a parent help out on a project helps out and helps kids stress less. While doing a project with family members might distract students from learning some say doing a project with parents might help kids focus as well. No kid wants to mess around during a project with their parents.\n \n In conclusion, there are many benefits to allowing the students to design their own project. If students were to be allowed to design their own summer projects it would help students focus more on the project, it wouldn't be a super stressful project and students could involve their family.Â",

Students should have a oppertunity to pick their own summer projects because it allows them to be more creative. It will give students less of a chance to cheat off each other. It will also help the teachers know more about their students, what they struggle with and what they understand.\n \n Students can be more creative and willing to do the project if they get to design it themselves. If its about something that is special to them they will put more effort into doing it. Most of the summer projects I got I didnt do because it didn't interest me at all. In English, they usually give out a summer reading list of books they want you to read. I would try to read the books that were on the list but they never made me want to finish it. If I had the oppertunity to pick my own books then I would read all summer.\n \n Letting students pick there own project would keep kids from cheating because if they have to pick their own topic then two kids can't write about the same thing the exact same way. Most students do their project at the last minute and schedules come out toward the end of summer. Therefore, they match their classes together or see if they have the same teacher and then they share answers before school even starts. Students shouldn't be given out packets with all the exact same questions because they will just cheat and learn nothing. Instead, we should be given projects that we get to pick.\n \n If we get to pick projects that mean somethng to us then the teachers can know more about who we are and not just by some packet with questions. Students could make projects about something that happened in their life or something that means a lot to them. Most teachers don't even care to know your name not to mentin who you even are. I still have teachers that ask me what my name is when they write a pass for me and i have been in school for almost 6 months. If students could do projects that mean something to them then maybe teachers would know who they are and not just some paper they are grading.\n \n In conclsion, Students should pick their projects and desgin the projects themselves. By letting students have a choice, It helps them and teachers too. The more creative students can be the more participation there will be.

      "some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure that kids are still learning over the summer. Leaving only one question should the projects be designed by teachers or the students. Now letting a teacher design a project over the summer rather than the student will only be like homework. Therefore you shouldnt let the teachers design it because if you have homework over the summer just like over the year nine times out of ten your not going to do it. But that does not change the fact that if a student was to design his project he or she would most likely get it done better and get it done more quicker if their designing it themselves. Then again some students may have trouble designing projects themselves. Therefore I do think teachers should design a version of the project for students that that really have the creativity or thought process to get done all on there own.\n \n Just imagine a student at home over the summer time he or she just getting out of school, going on break for two and a half months. think about what a student is going to go threw if a teacher designs a project and assign it to them. It will be way easier for the students to design there project the way they want it to be. For one there doing it over break which means the quicker he or she gets the out the way and done the better. So letting students design their own projects would better for the staff, students, and school. Making a student do teachers work over a break like the summer just isnt going to work because, if a student doesnt get the concept of the project that the teacher assigned then how is he other than looking it up on the internet which does not answer all question. Allowing students to actually get creative and design it them selves can actually help there knowledge in school and the real world. Then to go on and start the next year with good grades rather coming into a class room with an excuse because you where confused on what the teacher said.\n \n working on a project while on summer break may be hard if you got to think of it all by yourself. But not only will you have to think for your self you will have to think about how the teacher actually want this project done. I know that you'll have to worry about how the teachers want it done anyways but in this case the student will have the advantageÂ of designing the project themselves rather than having the teacher design cause any confusion. Because confusions lead to stress and stress results end with you not doing your project. which in that case you can say that it could really happen both ways but the point is that designing a project over summer break where its the student and only the student even tho sometimes he or she may have help from family membersÂ that still doesnt assure they will still get there education if their looking at something a teacher designed then letting them design it themselves. Its the students summer theey should atleast be able to design it themselves and not the teachers.\n \n In conclusion students that go to schools where they have projects overÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, summer project should be student-designed. For students, summer is a break from school; students should have the freedom to do a project based on what they want. Reasons why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility.\n \n First reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative. If students come up with what their projects is based on, it shows their creativeness. They can describe and show their personality through their project. They can also show their character and more about who they are. This can be a opportunity for students to open up with their teacher and classmates. Students can come out their comfort zone and be unique when creating their project.\n \n Second reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because students feel less pressured. If students have a certain project, they feel more pressured to do exactly what the project is based on. The project may be based on a subject they may not feel comfortable with. If students have a student-designed project, they will avoid that conflict because they will be able to choose their own topic. This may also pressure students because they could get a project that doesn't appeal to their personality.\n \n Third reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students responsibility. Students will have all summer to create their project; if the project is not done, it shows they aren't responsible. The project shows if they can be able to do a project before the new school year begins. Certain students will prove they're able to complete a project throughout the summer. While others will prove they aren't responsible enough to complete a project. In addition, this will give them a task to do while they aren't in school.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-based. My reasons on why I believe this should be a student-designed project is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility. A summer project should be a project you are comfortable with and can show how you unique every individual is. The project will also keep students feeling educated while not being in school.",

      "The concept of summer break presents many flaws to the school system. It causes students to lose vital information they learned the year prior and creates a lazy atmosphere with the absence of work. The clear solution to this is summer assignments and projects, yet some wonder who deserves to decide what the projects should consist of. Summer projects, a key tool to ensure continued enrichment, should be student designed to allow opportunities for creativity, increased enjoyment while working, as well as higher rates of motivation to continuously work on the project in order to nurture passion and a love for this work within students.\n \n During the school year teachers are obligated to obtain a set amount of grades and fit a certain curriculum, yet during summer these rules no longer apply. This leaves summer as the perfect time to allow for creativity with learning. One such example is the Sustainable Technology Class. This is a project driven class where students are given guidelines to fulfill and that is it. Many of the students taking this course have a passion for the material and need a chance to see all of the possibilities it can hold. With this class specific, originality could lead to a revolutionary invention, such as electricity generating bicycles or solar powered toys. Through this experience a student can truly fall in love with the world of science and decide to create a career out of it. A cpncept very similar to professors being able to do any research they can get approved within their budget. Also, including student led work could help school systems break the factory system pattern of the school year in which you do your assigned work and keep the classroom silent. Our current system, where students have very little say, easily leads to anxiety, exhaustion, and eventually, for some, fully dropping out of high school. By offering a chance to have a self designed, teacher approved project, students can fully appreciate knowledge in a way the benefits the individual.\n \n Once the door to creativity and choice has been opened, enjoyment has to follow. In 1800's France, a new style of art was emerging, impressionism. If these talented and famous painters, such as Monet and Van Gogh, solely followed the advice of their instructors and refused to step out to paint what they enjoy, we would not have beautiful works like Starry Night. If they had not branched out and followed their intuition and joy, they may never have continued painting due to constant belittlement of the art style they preferred. Our museums would be repetitions of the same work with very little diversity. This is true for essentially all art, another example of this is the Rock Revolution. If stars such as Elvis and the Beatles only followed the era of Big Band music and never were allowed to play and create what they enjoyed, music could have never evolved. With each generation, the world learns more and more. Advancements would never occur if every project was solely based off of the knowledge of the teacher.\n \n Finally, for the average student, September through June is an endless pattern of early mornings, tests, and work sheets created by their teachers. More importantly September through June is a pattern of procrastination for many students. Due to dread about a certain assignment or just plain boredom, work piles up and leaves the student to rush through it carelessly before the due date. A perfect example of this is Love Canal, New York. In the 1970's a community was built over a former dumping ground for radioactive waste. The families quickly noticed issues such as minor chemical burns from the grass and black sludge seeping into their houses, but the government ignored the growing tragedy. There was no action taken until 18 out of 21 children were born with severe chromosomalÂ defects. By this point, the government was forced to spend thousands of dollars in relocating the families as well as reparations, hospital bills, and environmental recovery. If they had not procrastinated, then it would have been considerably less expensive and would not have been as horrific as it ended up being. While this example may not directly highlight the issues within teacher driven projects, it does show what a consistent habit of procrastination can lead to. Which is what the school system instills in students by not allowing decision making. It is undeniable that when people care about the project being done, they are will put time and energy into it through out the whole experience, not just the ending.\n \n While there are some benefits to teacher driven projects, such as the possibility for concise instructions and often an obvious path to follow, these just allow the students to be overly protected and lazy. This prevents the potential for growth that comes from creating something and succeeding in it without the help of an adult. It also instills the idea that there will always be someone telling you what to do. Which is very harmful once these students get to the work field. They will be unprepared due to never doing fully original and individual work, and the school system would be the one to blame.\n \n In our modern world, we need innovation more than anything else. Young minds need to be nurtured, but also allowed to follow their own path of individuality and creativity. The only way to ensure the growth of these important traits is to loosen the leash and allow students to make some of the decisions. It is just one project per year, but a country wide switch could be revolutionary.Â",

      "Usually when school is out for summer break, you instantly forget about everything that you have learned. Nowadays, schools want you to do some of project or activity to assure that you have more knowledge and learning throughout the break. If these projects are really going to happen, they should be teacher-designed. If these projects are designed by teachers, then they are most likely going to be more educational, you can get hands-on help from a teacher, and overall they can allow you to become more prepared for the upcoming school year.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects should be teacher-designed because they can be more educational for the students. By doing this, you can learn many things that you never knew before. Such as ; a certain word problem, how to do an equation, or many other things as well. When the summer projects are finally over, you will be able to look back and see what all new information you have learned.\n \n Secondly, you can get better hands-on help from the teacher. Say one of the projects is about somethingÂ you have never seen or learned before. Obviously you are going to need to get help or a teacher's assistance. Instead of having to solve the problem by yourself, you can get someone's help so you can figure out what to do and how to do it.\n \n Thirdly, overall a project designed by a teacher will allow yourself to be be more prepared for the up and coming school year. If you have a project based on one of the classes you are going to take next year, you can start preparing based on that. You can start learning what the class is all about too. At the end of the day, no matter what type of activity or project it is, it will prepare you for the next school year.\n \n In conclusion, it is better for summer projects assigned by the school to be teacher-designed. In the end, they are way more educational than a project designed by a student them self. If you are not understanding something,or if it is difficult to complete, the teacher can help you out. Also in the long run, it will prepare and better yourself for the next school year.",

    ESSAY:
      "In the summer, learning significantly decreases in students, so it's important to continue learning. Having a summer project is a great way to do so, but is it better to have the project designed by teachers, or the students themselves? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what is expected to be learned, it will be fair to the students, and teachers already have more experience in designing assignments.\n \n Teachers are already well informed about the curriculum about the subject they teach, and they also know some of the curriculum for the other classes related to the subject. For example, a math teacher for Algebra 1 has also taught Geometry in the past. Since he has experience in Geometry, he knows what his students should expect in the next year when they take Geometry. The students were only exposed to the content in Algebra 1, therefore making it more productive if the math teacher designed the summer project. By implementing content of the next school year into the summer project, students will be better prepared for the class. Because teachers teach the curriculum for the students, they know what is most important/useful to remember. For instance, a Biology 1 teacher knows that the unit focused on animal and plant cell anatomy is crucial to remember because it is always used in Biology in general, so she mostly focuses the project with cell anatomy. It is beneficial to students if they are informed what is expected to be to know in the future. Teachers who know what is most useful to know would design summer projects more effectively by knowing what content to emphasize. Students do not know what is important to learn because they are in the process of learning, so having them design summer projects would not effectively help them better prepare over the summer.\n \n If students are assigned to design a summer project, they are most likely to do something that is personalized to be easy for themselves with a lot of bias, which is not fair to everyone. Such as, English 10 students were expected to come up with comprehension questions for a book, and they ended up creating questions that were easy to them, but very difficult for other students. Students would not know how to create assessments that would cater to everyone's level of knowledge. Since teachers oversee the class, they would know what kinds of questions to create that would best fit for the class's knowledge, with no bias. If there was student bias involved in designing a project, many other students will have complaints and disagree with the components of the project. For example, a history teacher who assigned a project did not receive a single complaint compared to when a student proposed a project. If students know that the project was designed by the teacher, it will significantly decrease the amount of complaints and the students would just accept it because he is a higher authority. By having the teacher design the project, students will all have a fair assignment to do with no bias since it was designed by the teacher. Having students design a project could create a lot of disagreement.\n \n Teachers have more experience in teaching and the basics of learning. They have traditionally always created and designed assignments in the past. For instance, a Psychology teacher has been teaching for over ten years knows how to create effective projects for his students. Since he has been teaching for over ten years, he has more experience and knows what he is doing. People with more experience can design better quality projects than someone who is still learning, Teachers know what techniques to use to effectively assess knowledge. An example is that an English teacher added more steps for annotating a book because she knows that it actually helps students understand the book better. A student would not like to add more steps in annotating a book because it is more work, but they do not know that is is very helpful in the long run. The process of learning is more likely to be effective if the assignment was designed by a teacher because they have more experience. It is important for students to learn with purpose and practice beneficial habits.\n \n If teachers designed summer projects, it would be beneficial to the students' learning. It would ensure that students are learning the correct information needed, would be be just for all the students, and it would be more efficient since teachers have more experience. The purpose of summer projects is to continue learning in students over the break, and teachers definitely have the power to do that.",

      "Summer projects, some schools have these projects to complete during the summmer so students do not have to completley stop learning during the break. The assignments are more than likely created by a teacher; What if the students created the assignments though?\n \n i believe that if student's created the project it would probably be easier than a teachers project, for the benefit of summer. On the other hand if teachers designs the project it will come with more work and more information for the benefit of real learning.\n \n Student designed projects, in my opinion, will probably help teachers in the short run because of the fact that teachers will not have to worry about creating a project. In the long run though, i believe students will not learn anything new. i think student's will just create it and make it easy just to get it over with and begin their summer. Or make it easy enough to just procrastinate about it all break and complete it at the end of summer. Even creating the project is more work for the students which i think will have some students not even trying to do it. If the project is created by students i think mostly all of the students will complete it and turn it in because of how easy they made it to be.\n \n Teacher designed projects, These projects will have what the teacher's and school want students to study during break. Teachers will actually create it to be work that will leave students with information that is needed and that should not be forgotten, for future puposes like for classes that they will be taking when back from break. I think a good amount of people would not complete the assignment due to the fact that teachers make them hard and actually have you do work. Students would rather be doing anything than a project during the summer. Teacher designed projects will help students out more in the long run because teacher's know what students need to study and focus on.\n \n So, in my opinion a teacher designed project is for the benefit of the student's learning. A student designed project though, is for the benefit of the student's summer. In both cases though the student is going to be working on it thoughout summer and keeping in touch with learning. I think it would be best if a teacher designed project was given for the summer. If the chance was given to me to create one though, i would definetly rather do that.Â",

      "In some schools, summer projects are assigned to assure that students will continue learning well after the school year ends. Although students should continue to learn during their break, some have argued that if the projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed is the better option because students will have more options to chose from, they can do a project they're interested in, and teacher-designed projects are annoying to produce.\n \n Many teachers would complain that students won't have any directions to follow on their projects and will thus not continue learning during their break. Although, students not having any directions on how to make their projects is true. This can be viewed as a purely subjective point, since this'll give students more freedom on how they want their projects to be. Another point of discussion is is that students won't continue to further learn during their break. This viewpoint that students won't continue to learn is wrong due to the fact that students will be learning while creating their projects.\n \n Having more options for students to choose from is great because students can create a project of something they're interested in with high effort. In the past, teachers would only give students one option for a project idea; therefore, limiting the chance of something that student would interested in and lowering the effort. For example, if a student was given the freedom to write about a certain sport they're interested in, they could make a well informed slide show to present to a class or could talk forever about their favorite team in a podcast. A student would choose to write something they're interested rather than having to read a long book than having to write a big ESSAY any day.\n \n Students can make projects more enjoyable is a valid point because it can show their creativity. Since students won't have any directions on how to make their projects, they can be as creative as they want. They can try out new ways to present projects like showing a cool infographic or make a fun video that can inform a class about a topic they worked on. This could make the actual work process of the project more enjoyable to the student and whoever they're presenting it too.\n \n The third reason why student-designed is the better option is because teachers can make projects annoying for the students. Teachers can sometimes make students go out of their way to work on their projects. To include, teachers can make it so students have to visit somewhere to get information to further continue working on their projects or make students have to buy certain books to write about. This may not seem so bad at first glance; however, for some students who go visit out of the country for the majority of the break can be a nightmare for them. Imagine a student being gone for the majority of the break just to come back and only have a little less than week to visit a musesum and write an ESSAY about it. This situation shows how teachers make projects annoying for these types of students.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project is better because students can choose what they want to talk about, projects would be more enjoyable for everyone, and students won't have to go out of their way from teacher-designed projects. Having more freedom in options leads to students picking something they're interested in.\n \n Students also show their creativity thus making it more enjoyable. finally, teachers make students go out of their way for projects; therefore, making it annoying for some students who travel.",

      "Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughoutÂ the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.\n \n Almost all teachers a facultyÂ spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.\n \n A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.\n \n If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. IfÂ assignmentsÂ must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power pointÂ on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during theÂ upcomingÂ school year\n \n Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed because an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, they are less restrictive, and students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.\n \n A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. For instance, a lot of the projects in school are tied to a specific topic. When it comes to choosing the type of project, at a first glance, there may seem like there is a lot to choose from. But in reality, this is just the illusion of choice. There isn't a lotÂ of room for creativity and imagination, therefore there isn't much freedom. Many individuals will agree that with more freedom, they have the liberties and creativity to come up with something that is unique. Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn, But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point.\n \n Student-designed projects are less restrictive. For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade.\n \n individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects. A project can seem like a large and outstanding task to finish for a large amount of students, and as a result, puts stress on an individual. A student-designed project can relieve plenty of this stress, as students can choose a subject that they are best at. It is easier for someone as they are more comfortable with a topic they are more knowledgeable with. Other individuals may argue that students should make an effort to choose a subject they aren't familiar with, but many can disagree because choosing a topic someone isn't familiar with puts more stress on a person and can lead to them struggling to learn.\n \n Summer projects help students learn during the break, but students should ultimately decide on designing their own projects for individuals to continue to learn. At the end of the day, they should have the freedom to enjoy doing what they are best at they shouldnt be stressed over work they aren't comfortable with in the summer.Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

In ways such as they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity abilities,and the students may be really be interested in the project that they are doing.\n \n First,when teachers assign a summer project it might be something that the student may not know or can not get a grasp of because it is too difficult for them to understand.

      "Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests.\n \n Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique.\n \n Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughoutÂ the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of.\n \n In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like.\n \n As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it.\n \n Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to designÂ it and stride for their best educational experience.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.\n \n If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new.Â Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.\n \n The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.\n \n Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.\n \n Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseveranceÂ and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.\n \n We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",

      "As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. This allows students to base their project on something that they are heavily interested in, others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with, and lastly it motivates them to complete their assignment with passion.\n \n It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult. However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view. When picking topics for a project, most students are inclined to base it on something that they have a liking for. When I was in middle school, I was part of a program called the\n \n Gifted and Talented, this program was centered on both, group and individual projects. We had been assigned a project in honor of Earth Day and due to my immense love and interest for marine life, I had decided on creating a vessel that would roam the ocean and detect any trash that had been tossed into the water, and collect it. After I had researched where most ocean trash was found, I had decided that this vessel would remain near beaches and ports. If the teacher had designed the project and told us that we had to create something on a specific topic such as, prevention of forest fires, there could have been a chance that I hadn't been as enthused and wouldn't have tried as much.Â Not only did this project help me think outside the box, but it also helped me decide on my future career by allowing me to research more on a topic that I was interested in.\n \n Furthermore, instead of sticking with something familiar, students might try and explore other topics in which they lack knowledge. By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life. I once new a woman who arrived at college \"undecided\". She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosingÂ by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.\n \n By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.\n \n Lastly, when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking. It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion. For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing. OriginallyÂ I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it. In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project. At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had. I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month. By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night. In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later.\n \n All in all, student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature. When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success. Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind. Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class. However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning. Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in. When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "As the school year comes to a close, countless students look forward to spending their days relaxing by the pool, going on vacation, and hanging out with their friends. For some, however, the beginning of summer break also means preparing for the next school year. Summer assignments are common among advanced high school classes, and are equally dreaded by most high school students. Moreover, teacher-designed projects do not spark much interest from those who must complete them. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should allow students to design their assignments because it promotes responsibility, keeps students interested, and provides more opportunities for students in school and in the future.\n \n When completing an assignment over the summer break, students are responsible for setting time aside in order to work and study. A good sense of responsibility is an essential part of designing a project and making sure it gets done. When crafting a project, students are responsible for creating their own ideas and implementing them correctly, in order to create an interactive and challenging assignment. Without good time management skills, a student may fall behind, leaving them with a sub par project, and most likely a disappointed teacher. Allowing a student to take the lead on designing a project will promote the necessary components of learning good time management. As well as time management, a student also learns how to balance priorities. Yes, summer is an amazing opportunity to have fun, but it also provides the means to be better prepared for the school year. When a student decides to prioritize a summer project over a video game or TV program, they set themselves up for future success in the form of a high grade. Focusing on one's priorities teaches them a great deal of responsibility, and can be applied to many different situations in the future. Allowing a student to design their own project teaches them how to effectively manage their time and understand their priorities, leading them to become more responsible.\n \n When a student learns or studies about something they are interested in, they are able to absorb more information. Letting a student design their own project will assist in a more powerful learning experience. If a student who was interested in trains received a project about frogs, chances are he/she would quickly become disinterested and bored. A student would perform far better on an assignment that their interests can be applied to. A student designed project promotes creativity, as well as sponsoring individuality. Moreover, it is almost impossible for a teacher to design a project that caters towards all the needs and interests of his/her students. A student-lead project would return higher grades and provide a way for a teacher to further understand each of her students, the way they learn, and their personal interests. This allows for a stronger relationship between a teacher and /his/her class, and creates a more beneficial learning environment. The decision to allow students to design their own projects will make for a more impactful, enjoyable, and interesting learning experience.\n \n Lastly, a student-designed project will provide more opportunity for students to expand their network, and discover what they want to study and achieve in the future. When working on a project or assignment that is based off the personal interests of an individual student, they could be inspired to study further into their chosen subject, and provide them with an idea of what they want in the future. A student who studies trains could soon realize that he/she is more interested in planes, and now wants to be a pilot. They could also be influenced to join a school club or get a job that pertains to their chosen subject. The ideas that they create when designing their own project can be applied to their goals for the future. As well as providing ideas for their career and future studies, they will also be able to expand their network of people who have the same aspirations as them. Designing a project allows for one to work with many different people, such as a partner or group, and offers the means to build new relationships and acquaintances. The idea of a student-designed summer project is more effective in expanding a student's knowledge of personal goals, and provides an environment with many opportunities to meet new people and discover new ideas.\n \n In conclusion, the benefits of a student-designed project are far greater than those of a teacher-designed project. Students learn new skills, such as responsibility and time management. They are also provided with opportunity to expand their knowledge, discover their interests, and discover themselves as an individual. The people they meet and work with throughout designing and completing a summer project will benefit them in school, further studies, and possibly even the work force. The idea of a student-designed project proves itself to be a more beneficial, rewarding, and fun experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn'tÂ know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.\n \n Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn'Â be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.\n \n Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher-designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed.",

      'Some schools that require students to complete summer projects to assure kids continue to learn over break is a smart idea. Yet, the question "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student- designed?" Can determine if a student will enjoy and do the work that they are assigned. These projects should be student-designed because this will cause a higher percent of students to do the work, while enjoying the experience, students can learn about something that they want, and teachers will be able to learn about the new students coming to their class.\n \n There is always a problem with kids not doing their assigned work. Starting off the year with a incomplete project could ruin the year for some. If students were allowed to design the project, they would be choosing topics that they are likely to complete, and ones that they can enjoy. There is a direct correlation with kids who enjoy the topic they are learning about and completion rate of projects. Student-designed projects may lead to a higher percent of kids doing their work and less kids pushing off projects till the last minute. This can assure that kids will be learning the matirial over summer break.\n \n Projects don\'t always have to be strictly information that we cover in school, sometimes it is good to learn about something that interests the individual. With student-designed projects, students will have the freedom to chose what they want to learn about. Giving this opportunity to students will allow them to show their interests to teachers and their peers. Having kids focus on something they find interesting, increases their drive to learn new information, which will help them throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n Student-designed projects will not only benefit students, teachers will learn about new students as the school year starts. Having teachers learn about students can help build important teacher-student relationships. Teacher-student relationships are important to develop throughout the year, so students feel they have a safe place to go if they need help or if they have had a bad day. Many students tend to have hard times learning from teachers they dont respect, or like. Projects that are student-designed will increase the trust kids have in their teachers, as well as teachers about new students.\n \n While some teachers and school officials may not be in favor of student-designed projects because it could be hard to grade if the teacher does not know the topic being presented. Many people would argue that students should not be the only people learning new things. Teachers should be able to learn about topics the students are interested in to better the way they interact with students. Although, teachers might not be experts on these topics, grade should not be on the information, rather on the way the student presents the information and how they researched each topic.\n \n While the answer to teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects can be up for debate their are many reason to why a student-designed project are better than teacher-designed project. The level of completion, student interest, and allowing for better teacher-student relationship are all very important to assure that students will continue to learn over break.Â',

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.\n \n Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.\n \n Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.\n \n Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer?Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine you just finished your sophomore year of high school. Summer has finally arrived! The whole Summer is yours for you to do anything and everything you want to do... except for your Summer assignment. In one class, your teacher has assigned you to run a specific research project that encompasses all the main ideas of the subject. In another class, the teacher has given you the assignment of designing and completing your own project. You sit down and think. Which one of these projects will teach me the subject better? Summer project assignments should be designed by the teacher of the course's project since it would avoid students designing projects that are not challenging enough, teachers know the subject better, and they are trained to give the right assignments for effective teaching.\n \n First and foremost, high school students are known to avoid the heavier workload if given the choice of a lighter one, even if the heavier workload will benefit them in the long run. For example, I've had the experience of having a history class assign more work one year, and the next year's history class assign less. In the class with more projects and work given, I learned the material more thoroughly and can still apply the material I learned to other situations. On the other hand, I can't remember much of the material from the class that gave me less work and projects. Though I enjoyed the lighter class, I learned that more work is equivalent to a better understanding of the subject. This, therefore, means that students, with their preference for less work, would not benefit from designing their own project since they'd simply design a light and extremely easy project.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design Summer projects is that they know the subject they teach better than the students they are assigning the project to. Teachers, apart from having learned and gone through the same classes as the students they teach, have also gone to college and studied the subject in a lot more depth for years. They simply know more than the student and know what projects helped them, as students, learn the material. A chemistry teacher, for example, is going to know what project to give to students in order for the student to learn chemistry since the students haven't even taken the class yet. Students do not know what projects will teach them effectively.\n \n Additionally, teachers have gone through years of schooling and college to get to the position they are in, as well as probably having years of teaching experience. They have been trained to teach students effectively and know what methods of teaching work best. This also means that teachers know which projects and what approach to projects are best for students. In my science class one year I had the option of designing and running my own experiment. I chose the easiest option and ended up doing badly since there were no instructions or guidelines for the experiment. I did learn from my mistakes and having to teach myself the subjects related to the experiment, but the experiment was mostly a fiasco. I learned the subjects a lot better when my teacher gave us a project that had clear intentions and guidelines that guided us to the main lesson we were being taught rather than just a project of doing whatever thrown at us. Teacher usually knows best.\n \n After a few moments of thinking, you come to the conclusion that teacher-designed projects teach you better and more effectively. Yes, you as a student do know how you yourself learn better than a teacher knows how you specifically learn. Yes, students can also learn from the process and mistakes of designing a project, but the truth is that the likelihood of at least the majority of students putting the effort into their project to put these ideas into account is very low. Teachers know how to teach and what projects to give to students to effectively teach. Now, you sit down and start your projects.",

      "Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.\n \n Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.\n \n Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do. Teachers are the ones ensuring that their students are prepared and know the material, and it is their responsibility to prepare their students for their curriculum.

      "When was the last time you have been assigned a project over summer break? My last summer project was this past summer. It was a history project that took me days to complete. All I remember was dreading to work on the project because I already knew the information that it was about. Instead of the summer project being only a review, it should have been both a review and new information. Students get bored learning the same thing over and over again. They need something to help them for the upcoming year as they enter a new class. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because students would learn better, use their creative ability, and be more motivated to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should not be about keeping the student busy. They should be about preparing the student for the new class along with helping the student retain past information. If the projects were student-designed, then students would be more likely to learn better. When I was in tenth grade, our task was to create our own project based off a certain number of topics that were given to us. I chose to do my project about World War Two. Since I chose something that I am interested in, I learned a lot of new information and information that I already knew. If I was assigned a project about old civilizations, then I probably wouldn't have learned as well as I did. This is a prime example showing how a student-designed project will help a student learn better.\n \n Creativity is something that is difficult to express for students. There are very little opportunities to express who you really are in school. Every small chance that a student gets to show their personality is an opportunity. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed. Furthermore, if a summer project was student-designed, then that student will have a ton of opportunities to create something that represents them. For example, an artsy student might pick a project that involves drawing or painting. An athletic student might pick a project that involves a challenge. Finally, a studious student might do a project that has a lot of work. The possibilities are endless. Having each and every student express who they are can inspire many in and out of school. This is only the second reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n The last reason summer projects should be student-designed is because the students would be more motivated to complete the project. Summer is the only time that students have a long-tern break. They don't think about school or learning too often. The last thing they want to think about is another project that their teacher assigned to them. Their motivation to complete this project is very low. The only way to help motivate students would be to allow the project to be student-designed. It needs to be a project that they will enjoy doing. It can't be just another project that the teacher assigns just because why not. Last year, in chemistry, I was allowed to pick my project for my end of year science research project. I picked a topic that I wanted to see the outcome of. Throughout the entire project, I was motivated to complete it. This is because I chose what I wanted to do. Some people might say that a student can be motivated to complete a project even if it is teacher-designed. The counter to this is that when a student designs a project that they are interested in, the likelihood for that student to complete the project increases greatly. This is because they know what they want to learn about and what is interesting for them. Every little bit of motivation can help a student learn more than they thought.\n \n As you can see, student-designed projects are way better than boring teacher-designed projects. These were only just a few reasons why student-designed projects are better. Now that you know which one is better, I encourage all people to advocate around their community to make this a reality. Every student should be able to do a project on what they want to learn about. If we all used our voice to express our thoughts, then our planet would be a much better place in and outside of school.",

      "Some schools are required to assign assignments to their students to do a summer project during their summer break, but I believe that students should'nt be required to have summer projects. And I also believe that student should have a student-designed say in this because it's their choice based on if they would rather have summer assignments or not. I get it teachers want students to have summer assignments so that they're still learning but if students have assignments during their time off is that even summer break if students still have to do work during thier break.\n \n One reason why I believe that students should'nt have summer projects is because it is summer and student just want to enjoy their break and have fun. Student should have a say in this is because it's their choice if they would like to do summer projects or just enjoy and relax. I think most student would rather pick having fun and relaxing over summer projects, because for nine months students are going at least to 7 classes for nine months and learning new things, also doing projects, homework, classwork and more. If students had to have a vote for summer assignments or having a summer break without any summer projects, the majority of the students would pick summer break without any summer projects.\n \n Another reason why I believe students should design summer projects is because some students might get overwhelmed and very stressed out. School can be really stressful especially if you're failing some of your classes and getting a lot of work. Another reason why I think school is stressful is because you have seven classes and most teachers asign assignments to their students, this can be stressful for students because they have a lot of work to finish and some assignment are due the next or next class and they have to think about their other class assignments. Most students have a job and they won't have time to their summer assignment or they either went to vaction because summer time is about relaxing and having no worries, it should be a stress free summer. Summer is a time to enjoy while there is no school or no work assignments, summer break is a time to spend time with family and go to fun places and explore new things and places, not just doing school work while it is summer break.\n \n The final reason why I believe that student should have a say in summer project is because students should have a good time off. Students should'nt have summer projects because some students might go to summer school and have to do more work on top of summer projects, while they're doing summer school work , it could lead to some students not doing the summer project because summer school is too much stress for them. When student are in school they aren't really going on vaction or they aren't going out as much having fun because of school. The majority of the student don't want to miss school because if they miss school for a day it can back up them up from learning and not knowing anything that is going on in class. And summer break is about going out on vaction and exploring new things and adventure's, also not having to worry what time they have to be home for school or doing any assignment because it is summer break they should be able to enjoy it until school starts again. The majority of students don't go out on school day or during the weekends because they're either busy, working or just don't have time, that's why we have summer break so that we can relax and have fun and not worry about summer assignments.\n \n In conclusion these are the three main reasons as to why I believe that students should be students should not be assigned summer projects , so that they can enjoy their summer vaction off and being stress free until school starts again, I also believe that all students and staff should have off so that they all get a break and time off to relax and have family time.Â",

By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is adequate and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.\n \n If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.",

      "One time in the 5th grade me and my classmates were given an assignment that we were told to design by ourselves. We were told to choose any format to present our projects and allowed to present it on any topic as long as it related to science. As the deadline for the project drew near many students talked about how they had not completed the project because they lacked direction. As a result many students received bad grades and teachers struggled to grade individual projects on the same scale due to varying formats and topics. Many schools are questioning whether summer assignments should be designed by students or teachers. Mandatory summer projects shouldÂ be designed by teachers to guarantee that students have a clear understanding of requirements and continue to learn over the break.\n \n Educators best understand the curriculum students need to keep up with. In the majority of schools different departments are run by teachers working together to design the courses. If summer projects are designed by the same teachers then schools can ensure that the assignments will help students prepare for upcoming classes.\n \n Additionally, these projects can give a general idea of how the class will be taught and how difficult the course will be. This way students can get a head start on the material and have a complete understanding of what will be required.\n \n When designing tasks teachers can ensure that students are given enough work to learn. Over the summer of my freshman year I was given a project where students were allowed to choose which book they read and write a report on it. Many students chose short novels and finished their assignments in only a day. This caused any potential learning to be lost as students mostly forgot about the assignment after completing it. Projects designed by teachers can ensure that students do enough work over their break to continue learning outside of school and that the work matches the level of the class.\n \n Teachers can give additional support and instruction on assignments they designed. When projects are created by students teachers may struggle to help them with questions they may have. In the English department at my school teachers all work together to design large projects so that anyone in the department can answer questions and help students. This leads to a better understanding among students but still allows them to create unique and individual products that promote growth.\n \n Projects assigned over long breaks should be designed by teachers because teachers can better understand the curriculum, ensure that students learn, and provide additional support on assignments. In the future more assignments could be created that allow students to get a glimpse at upcoming material. Long breaks that often cause students to lose touch with the rhythm of school can be turned into opportunities to prepare. We should all encourage the furthering of our education by demanding that schools around us help students learn over break and require teachers to design summer projects for students.Â  Â Â Â",

    ESSAY:
      "During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more effective regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.\n \n To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more effective and helpful for a student in the long run.\n \n Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more effective. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.\n \n Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more effective regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may effectively design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more effective if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be effectively prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also effectively make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.\n \n As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more effective than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more effective, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.",

      "Summer projects are often assigned to students to ensure learning continues over the summer. They help keep students' hands moving and gears turning. Projects are typically designed by teachers, however, when made by students the work load is easier to handle and is best fitted to each, individual student. Teachers can't always make classwork fun and engaging. By having a student make their own project, it takes the work load off the teacher and gives the student work they will enjoy doing. Additionally, most projects made by teachers have the same structure, therefore, it would be easier for students to cheat. Lack of supervision and a surplus of free time can lead to unwantedÂ collaborations.\n \n Everyone knows students dislike school, It has loud teachers and bone numbing A/C. Students are constantly falling asleep in class, not listening, and avoiding work. Being assigned a project over their sunny Summer break must be a bummer, right? That's what most people think, but assigning work that students have more liberty over can give them the upper-hand. They can choose a project that they have the supplies for, set it so it doesn't take much effort or time, and not to mention, they can be creative! They get an opportunity to explore something they're passionate about. And when a student is passionate about something, they make sure everyone knows.\n \n Projects take up time. In the Summer, time is in excess. Giving out a project makes sure they always have something to do. Students loose a lot over their break, they come back to school perplexed at a simple math problem. Take Generic_Name into example, she's an A-B student but every summer she looses what she learned that school year and it takes a few weeks for her to get back on track. Usually her first report card has C's and even D's. But one summer in 10th grade she was assigned two projects and her first report card in 11th grade had ALL A's! She was way ahead of the class and felt more confident when completing her assignments. Practice is key to gaining knowledge. With students tongue tied, Summer projects help turn their question marks into exclamation points!\n \n The teacher may also get a better understanding of his/her students. They get to see what they like, what inspires them, what makes them mad, what makes them said or what they have strong opinions on. It makes it easier to relate to a generation that seems illegible on the exterior. Kids can be confusing, especially with the professional relationship of teachers and students. They can't be as personal with their students, even then, there's too many to even try!\n \n Student-made projects give teachers an easy window into their individuality. Future projects may also improve and become better suited to the audience. Complaints about the complexity or disappointment of their assignment will disappear. And, yet again, the work load that is removed. No more stressing about what they should learn, just some simple guidelines and grading rubric. They could even make their own!\n \n Teachers put a lot of effort into their job, some would say the most out of any job. Their own money and heart is put into their work. They buy students supplies and are even are taught as if they were the teacher's own! There will always be that one kid that wants to show off and ends up biting off more than he can chew. Teachers give great structure by making it themselves. Projects are also easier to grade because they would all have the same structure. Summer projects can be a great way to keep minds growing over that long break, it just depends on the situation as to who should create the project.",

Why? because it's their summer and if it's a boring project that a teacher assigned it's most likely not going to get done , because it don't catch the student interest if the student design their own project they created it's most likely to get done because it's something that he/she likes.\n \n Teacher design might not be what the students are interested in , and they might not understand it. If the student creates their design it could be fun and easy for them, and they will be learning from it as well, and they will understand it more because they are make whatever out of it. They could do it in their own way which will also make them determine to complete their own design they created.\n \n Students design could also help the teachers too , they wouldn't have to do much planning cause the students have to come up with their own designs so the students have to come out with ideas on their own. The students will be engaged because they have to focus on what they will come up with for their design for this summer project also the enjoyment they would get out for creating their own design project. The students will be learning it in their own way that's not boring to them. That way it will keep them motivated and interested while they are working on their project.\n \n Student's should have a right to do something that would be entertaining to them since it's the summer and they have to work on it so they can continue to learn.

      "Work over the summer sounds boring enough, it creates less time to have fun over the summer break. However, what if it was the students to design the summer project, that can be based on a interest, a hobby, or an activity. In addition, if this was a possibility, creativity can shine on a student project, and a sense of pride upon working, so while doing work, student can enjoy of what they enjoy, share their ideas and passion. While others believe, that teacher should designed the summer projects; However, if the summer project was a student design, it'll benefits students and gives freedom to work on what they are interested.\n \n If were to be students designing a summer project for school, it brings out the creativity and how its unique from comparing other student's projects. Also, this summer project can spark a students passion or ideas to share, and create a voice for themselves. Moreover, student designed project, can cause less vulnerability of copying others projects, it creates a space where everyone is unique in their own way. I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.\n \n From the project, there was not a lot of commitmentÂ for sharing ideas. ProcrastinationÂ happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot ofÂ encouragementÂ to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.\n \n In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share.Â",

      "When it's summer it basically means freedom for all kids. But there are some schools who do give their kids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their break and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can make time to work and pick their own deadlines, make their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.\n \n Students should be able to make time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.\n \n Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already know what they need to know, and by making them do something they don't know at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't know during the school year and now they have to learn it during there break.\n \n A teachers goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to make their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.\n \n Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it.Â",

      "Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.\n \n If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?\n \n When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student canÂ do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.\n \n Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.\n \n Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.",

This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughoutÂ the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.\n \n Almost all teachers a facultyÂ spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.\n \n A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.\n \n If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. IfÂ assignmentsÂ must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power pointÂ on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during theÂ upcomingÂ school year\n \n Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed because an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, they are less restrictive, and students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.\n \n A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. For instance, a lot of the projects in school are tied to a specific topic. When it comes to choosing the type of project, at a first glance, there may seem like there is a lot to choose from. But in reality, this is just the illusion of choice. There isn't a lotÂ of room for creativity and imagination, therefore there isn't much freedom. Many individuals will agree that with more freedom, they have the liberties and creativity to come up with something that is unique. Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn, But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point.\n \n Student-designed projects are less restrictive. For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade.\n \n individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects. A project can seem like a large and outstanding task to finish for a large amount of students, and as a result, puts stress on an individual. A student-designed project can relieve plenty of this stress, as students can choose a subject that they are best at. It is easier for someone as they are more comfortable with a topic they are more knowledgeable with. Other individuals may argue that students should make an effort to choose a subject they aren't familiar with, but many can disagree because choosing a topic someone isn't familiar with puts more stress on a person and can lead to them struggling to learn.\n \n Summer projects help students learn during the break, but students should ultimately decide on designing their own projects for individuals to continue to learn. At the end of the day, they should have the freedom to enjoy doing what they are best at they shouldnt be stressed over work they aren't comfortable with in the summer.Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

And the outcome of the summer project would look stunning.\n \n Finally,when given the project from the teacher it may come to a surpriseÂ that some students may not be interested into that one subject or topic that they are learning,so they would lose interestÂ in the whole project and not put effort into it. But if it is for a topic or subject that they are interested in and that they can choose the teacher would fully capture their interest and the student may put effort into the project. And if they know so much about that one thing then you are sure going to see a lotÂ of things down on that project.\n \n One can argue that this is not a good idea for students on choosing their project one reason one could say is that it may lack focusÂ ,that this curtain thing wont help them in life, and that they need to know more important things in school so that is why teachers would assign these projects for the teacher to know the understandings of their students.\n \n So in conclusion, student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways that they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity,and the students may be really interested in the project that they are doing. And this can help them do more well in school due to that one summer project.",

    ESSAY:
      "Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests.\n \n Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique.\n \n Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughoutÂ the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of.\n \n In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like.\n \n As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it.\n \n Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to designÂ it and stride for their best educational experience.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.\n \n If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new.Â Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.\n \n The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.\n \n Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.\n \n Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseveranceÂ and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.\n \n We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",

      "Summer Projects for school should be Teacher-designed because it will show students the expectations for the course, helps them learn the specific material that is needed, and keeps students on track. The main part of summer projects is to assure that students continue their learning process. While schools have long breaks at a time, it is difficult to come back and still remember all of the things that was taught before being let out for a long amount of time. Teachers and student both struggle to jump back into the schedule of going to school each day. Many students have a hard time maintaining everything after being a way and not looking at the material for a while. Some schools require students to complete assignments or projects during a long period break to maintain their learning abilities, but if students are not given the right objective, then they are bound to not learn anything. There are many examples on why summer projects should be teacher-designed.\n \n First, students need expectations and requirements for school projects because it shows them what the teacher will be looking for while grading. This can relate back to whenever a teacher is gone for a period of time or is absent for the day and tells the students what is expected of them while the teacher is away. Having expectations and requirements for a project makes sure that the student puts in effort and that the assignment is detailed with the right topics. While students are working on an assignment, and ESSAY, or a project, they do tend to lead their way off topic and start to write about unnecessary details. Having a list or a checklist of things that are expected of each student helps them know what needs to be on it and it is easier to follow.\n \n Most students have said that they prefer checklist and requirements than anything else because it is helpful to check off instructions and make sure that everything that is needed is on the assignment.\n \n Next, having students keep the learning process going during the summer with help their growing minds, but if they are not given the right topics and material then they will be confused and would have not learned a single new thing. With projects, students are suppose to make the assignment talk and discuss a main point of a topic. Teachers usually make projects as specific as possible, if the student was told to do it themselves then it would be easy for them to not go into detail and specifics about anything. In school, most topics have a huge variety of smaller details and information that would not be a main point in assignments and projects. Students would have to follow what the teacher wants to make sure that they do not write down the wrong information. Most of the time, when a teacher designs a project, they usually give a variety of tools and websites to go to if they need more information on something. Those websites and tools will give the specific examples and info on what the topic is based on and it will help the students have a better knowledge of the main point.\n \n Lastly, after focusing on one main topic for a long time, students tend to get bored and not try as hard as they should. Some students have a hard time staying on track while doing something school related on their own, they usually need some guidance to follow and go by. If summer projects were student-designed, the students would not be able to follow what they need to do and would not have any rules to go by. Different students have different ways of learning, some like to do hands on activities or web questsÂ to learn, others just prefer to write down everything that they learn as notes. A teacher-designed project can give different ways of portraying the material. A teacher-designed project will also make students be on time with the assignment. If a teacher assigns a summer project, they will most likely attach when specific things are due at what time, for example: the ESSAY portion will be due in 2 weeks, the rough draft is due in 1 week, the poster with the end result is due the first day of school. Most big projects that take a while to finish will have smaller tasks to finish throughout of period before it is due. Teachers can tell if students are on the right track if they assign things during the process of working on the project.\n \n In other words, having a student designed summer project is not a great idea. If students made the project by themselves, the teacher could become confused while trying to figure out the main topic. Students would not follow any sort of guideline unless a teacher attaches it to the assignment. If the project was not designed by a teacher, then the student making it would not be great with knowing when to put deadlines and they would not be sure with what to put on the project. The summer project will most likely be done much sooner because made it clear when things will be due. If it was made by a student, they will more likely slack off and be lazy with portraying the assignment. A teacher-designed summer project would be the most efficient way to stay on track with deadlines, to know what to talk about or not, and it shows the requirements and expectations that the teacher wants to see.

    ESSAY:
      "As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. This allows students to base their project on something that they are heavily interested in, others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with, and lastly it motivates them to complete their assignment with passion.\n \n It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult. However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view. When picking topics for a project, most students are inclined to base it on something that they have a liking for. When I was in middle school, I was part of a program called the\n \n Gifted and Talented, this program was centered on both, group and individual projects. We had been assigned a project in honor of Earth Day and due to my immense love and interest for marine life, I had decided on creating a vessel that would roam the ocean and detect any trash that had been tossed into the water, and collect it. After I had researched where most ocean trash was found, I had decided that this vessel would remain near beaches and ports. If the teacher had designed the project and told us that we had to create something on a specific topic such as, prevention of forest fires, there could have been a chance that I hadn't been as enthused and wouldn't have tried as much.Â Not only did this project help me think outside the box, but it also helped me decide on my future career by allowing me to research more on a topic that I was interested in.\n \n Furthermore, instead of sticking with something familiar, students might try and explore other topics in which they lack knowledge. By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life. I once new a woman who arrived at college \"undecided\". She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosingÂ by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.\n \n By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.\n \n Lastly, when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking. It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion. For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing. OriginallyÂ I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it. In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project. At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had. I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month. By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night. In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later.\n \n All in all, student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature. When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success. Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind. Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class. However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning. Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in. When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about.Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer is a time for student to have a long deserved break from school. During this time, however, some students become unable to no longer retain their knowledge and have to recover prior knowledge starting the next school year. To compensate, some schools assign summer projects for the students to be proactively accomplishing. Whether it be a project that they get to design or a teacher designs for them. The main argument here is \"what is better\" for the learning experience of the student. A project created and designed by a student over the summer is better than a teacher designed one because the project will be more engaging for the student, the student will have full control, and the student will have easier time learning or their own accord.\n \n A student who designs their own summer project will have a engaging experience with their project. As a student, the ability for a project to be fun to do and still be a good learning experience is number one. Having your own project to do gives you the sense that you know what you're capable of accomplishing. It will be engaging because student will get to interact in their own methods and ways. Learning in this way helps students to retain information and maybe learn about something they may have never thought about. An engaging project made by the students will also give the students a means of commitment to do the project if it is fun to do and is beneficial for them academically. Engagement in a project is the best way for a students to want to be able to drive their passion in learning forward, without the hassle of abiding by the teacher's rules and regulation of the project. Giving students the right to build their own project makes the learning part fun and engaging for the students, which will overall provide them with possibly of better academic achievement and retention.\n \n Students with full control their project will be able to make it a project they will be proud of. Full control means that students will be able to go though the steps of conception, planning/design, making/prototyping, and possibly revision on their own. Giving students the leveraging control, builds the sense that they understand the topic the most and that they should be able to complete the project under their own goals and ideas. This helps to build skills in learning and retaining information taught. With full control, they will also have the necessary time to complete their project on their own without the overlooking burden of a teacher telling them what to do exactly. This removes the unnecessary stress of designing a project to meet someone else's goals and hoping that it will meet their specifications. A student, given this freedom of choice and design, will be able to learn more about something that they enjoy learning about, it makes the overall experience better for them and also builds their design processes to be better efficientÂ and less costly to them. These skills learned from being in full control of a major project can be used in schools and possibly be used later in the workplace or any other setting that puts them under control of a project.\n \n The last argument is that students will have an easier time of learning when they get to make it. Without the teacher being in the way, not only will the student be hopefully, less stressed, but also put them in charge of learning. Being able to self pace yourself, will help to slowly build up information into your mind and retain that information for longer when you may have to use it one day in the near future. Without the regulations of an authoritative teacher, students build projects under their ideas. As long as the project is providing the student with educational content that they will learn from, they will be able to enjoy it, which removes the boring parts of learning about a certain subject and instead, make it fun to learn about and understand. Students building up the knowledge slowly by themselves, will slowly integrate the information into their mind slowly, without overwhelming students with complex research projects or projects dealing with hard to reach goals assigned by the teacher. A student who learns by themselves may be smarter and less worried by the goals of a project than a student who has to follow the rules and regulations word for word from the teacher. Students that get to design the projects themselves will overall have an easier time understanding and learning.\n \n A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is effectively gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will help them excel academically.\n \n To wrap up, projects under the design of a student will be better than a teacher designed one because the students are better engaged in their own projects, the students will have full control of their project and everything that goes into it, and the students will have an easier time comprehending/learning at their own pace. Schools that assign summer projects know that the real intent is to help keep the students proactive in their studies over the summer break, and these projects are suppose to help them do so. Student designed projects will be a better option for schools since it gives the students choice in their education. And that profound statement, gives students a better chance at starting off the next school year with information ready to be used.Â",

      "As the school year comes to a close, countless students look forward to spending their days relaxing by the pool, going on vacation, and hanging out with their friends. For some, however, the beginning of summer break also means preparing for the next school year. Summer assignments are common among advanced high school classes, and are equally dreaded by most high school students. Moreover, teacher-designed projects do not spark much interest from those who must complete them. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should allow students to design their assignments because it promotes responsibility, keeps students interested, and provides more opportunities for students in school and in the future.\n \n When completing an assignment over the summer break, students are responsible for setting time aside in order to work and study. A good sense of responsibility is an essential part of designing a project and making sure it gets done. When crafting a project, students are responsible for creating their own ideas and implementing them correctly, in order to create an interactive and challenging assignment. Without good time management skills, a student may fall behind, leaving them with a sub par project, and most likely a disappointed teacher. Allowing a student to take the lead on designing a project will promote the necessary components of learning good time management. As well as time management, a student also learns how to balance priorities. Yes, summer is an amazing opportunity to have fun, but it also provides the means to be better prepared for the school year. When a student decides to prioritize a summer project over a video game or TV program, they set themselves up for future success in the form of a high grade. Focusing on one's priorities teaches them a great deal of responsibility, and can be applied to many different situations in the future. Allowing a student to design their own project teaches them how to effectively manage their time and understand their priorities, leading them to become more responsible.\n \n When a student learns or studies about something they are interested in, they are able to absorb more information. Letting a student design their own project will assist in a more powerful learning experience. If a student who was interested in trains received a project about frogs, chances are he/she would quickly become disinterested and bored. A student would perform far better on an assignment that their interests can be applied to. A student designed project promotes creativity, as well as sponsoring individuality. Moreover, it is almost impossible for a teacher to design a project that caters towards all the needs and interests of his/her students. A student-lead project would return higher grades and provide a way for a teacher to further understand each of her students, the way they learn, and their personal interests. This allows for a stronger relationship between a teacher and /his/her class, and creates a more beneficial learning environment. The decision to allow students to design their own projects will make for a more impactful, enjoyable, and interesting learning experience.\n \n Lastly, a student-designed project will provide more opportunity for students to expand their network, and discover what they want to study and achieve in the future. When working on a project or assignment that is based off the personal interests of an individual student, they could be inspired to study further into their chosen subject, and provide them with an idea of what they want in the future. A student who studies trains could soon realize that he/she is more interested in planes, and now wants to be a pilot. They could also be influenced to join a school club or get a job that pertains to their chosen subject. The ideas that they create when designing their own project can be applied to their goals for the future. As well as providing ideas for their career and future studies, they will also be able to expand their network of people who have the same aspirations as them. Designing a project allows for one to work with many different people, such as a partner or group, and offers the means to build new relationships and acquaintances. The idea of a student-designed summer project is more effective in expanding a student's knowledge of personal goals, and provides an environment with many opportunities to meet new people and discover new ideas.\n \n In conclusion, the benefits of a student-designed project are far greater than those of a teacher-designed project. Students learn new skills, such as responsibility and time management. They are also provided with opportunity to expand their knowledge, discover their interests, and discover themselves as an individual. The people they meet and work with throughout designing and completing a summer project will benefit them in school, further studies, and possibly even the work force. The idea of a student-designed project proves itself to be a more beneficial, rewarding, and fun experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn'tÂ know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.\n \n Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn'Â be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.\n \n Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher-designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed.",

      'Some schools that require students to complete summer projects to assure kids continue to learn over break is a smart idea. Yet, the question "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student- designed?" Can determine if a student will enjoy and do the work that they are assigned. These projects should be student-designed because this will cause a higher percent of students to do the work, while enjoying the experience, students can learn about something that they want, and teachers will be able to learn about the new students coming to their class.\n \n There is always a problem with kids not doing their assigned work. Starting off the year with a incomplete project could ruin the year for some. If students were allowed to design the project, they would be choosing topics that they are likely to complete, and ones that they can enjoy. There is a direct correlation with kids who enjoy the topic they are learning about and completion rate of projects. Student-designed projects may lead to a higher percent of kids doing their work and less kids pushing off projects till the last minute. This can assure that kids will be learning the matirial over summer break.\n \n Projects don\'t always have to be strictly information that we cover in school, sometimes it is good to learn about something that interests the individual. With student-designed projects, students will have the freedom to chose what they want to learn about. Giving this opportunity to students will allow them to show their interests to teachers and their peers. Having kids focus on something they find interesting, increases their drive to learn new information, which will help them throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n Student-designed projects will not only benefit students, teachers will learn about new students as the school year starts. Having teachers learn about students can help build important teacher-student relationships. Teacher-student relationships are important to develop throughout the year, so students feel they have a safe place to go if they need help or if they have had a bad day. Many students tend to have hard times learning from teachers they dont respect, or like. Projects that are student-designed will increase the trust kids have in their teachers, as well as teachers about new students.\n \n While some teachers and school officials may not be in favor of student-designed projects because it could be hard to grade if the teacher does not know the topic being presented. Many people would argue that students should not be the only people learning new things. Teachers should be able to learn about topics the students are interested in to better the way they interact with students. Although, teachers might not be experts on these topics, grade should not be on the information, rather on the way the student presents the information and how they researched each topic.\n \n While the answer to teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects can be up for debate their are many reason to why a student-designed project are better than teacher-designed project. The level of completion, student interest, and allowing for better teacher-student relationship are all very important to assure that students will continue to learn over break.Â',

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.\n \n Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.\n \n Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.\n \n Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer?Â",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine you just finished your sophomore year of high school. Summer has finally arrived! The whole Summer is yours for you to do anything and everything you want to do... except for your Summer assignment. In one class, your teacher has assigned you to run a specific research project that encompasses all the main ideas of the subject. In another class, the teacher has given you the assignment of designing and completing your own project. You sit down and think. Which one of these projects will teach me the subject better? Summer project assignments should be designed by the teacher of the course's project since it would avoid students designing projects that are not challenging enough, teachers know the subject better, and they are trained to give the right assignments for effective teaching.\n \n First and foremost, high school students are known to avoid the heavier workload if given the choice of a lighter one, even if the heavier workload will benefit them in the long run. For example, I've had the experience of having a history class assign more work one year, and the next year's history class assign less. In the class with more projects and work given, I learned the material more thoroughly and can still apply the material I learned to other situations. On the other hand, I can't remember much of the material from the class that gave me less work and projects. Though I enjoyed the lighter class, I learned that more work is equivalent to a better understanding of the subject. This, therefore, means that students, with their preference for less work, would not benefit from designing their own project since they'd simply design a light and extremely easy project.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design Summer projects is that they know the subject they teach better than the students they are assigning the project to. Teachers, apart from having learned and gone through the same classes as the students they teach, have also gone to college and studied the subject in a lot more depth for years. They simply know more than the student and know what projects helped them, as students, learn the material. A chemistry teacher, for example, is going to know what project to give to students in order for the student to learn chemistry since the students haven't even taken the class yet. Students do not know what projects will teach them effectively.\n \n Additionally, teachers have gone through years of schooling and college to get to the position they are in, as well as probably having years of teaching experience. They have been trained to teach students effectively and know what methods of teaching work best. This also means that teachers know which projects and what approach to projects are best for students. In my science class one year I had the option of designing and running my own experiment. I chose the easiest option and ended up doing badly since there were no instructions or guidelines for the experiment. I did learn from my mistakes and having to teach myself the subjects related to the experiment, but the experiment was mostly a fiasco. I learned the subjects a lot better when my teacher gave us a project that had clear intentions and guidelines that guided us to the main lesson we were being taught rather than just a project of doing whatever thrown at us. Teacher usually knows best.\n \n After a few moments of thinking, you come to the conclusion that teacher-designed projects teach you better and more effectively. Yes, you as a student do know how you yourself learn better than a teacher knows how you specifically learn. Yes, students can also learn from the process and mistakes of designing a project, but the truth is that the likelihood of at least the majority of students putting the effort into their project to put these ideas into account is very low. Teachers know how to teach and what projects to give to students to effectively teach. Now, you sit down and start your projects.",

      "Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.\n \n Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.\n \n Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do. Teachers are the ones ensuring that their students are prepared and know the material, and it is their responsibility to prepare their students for their curriculum. At the end of the day, the students are not the ones getting paid to teach their students.",

      "Should students have the ability to create their own projects to further their own education during the summer; or should the instructor give a teacher-designed project?Â Students should be able to make their own student-designed project. They have a say in their own education, especially when it comes to their summer break.Â Unlike teachers; students know their own limits when it comes to stress. Teachers tend to give more and more work to 'help' their students, when they are really hurting their mental state. Although, some students are proven to be less responsible than others, they are able to realize what they can and can't do. Yes, continuing student's education over the summer might be the best for them, but is it really worth stressing them out?\n \n Summer time for teachers and students, is a time for them to have fun and relax. Why have the teacher do the project on their break, when their students can do so in a way that they enjoy? Students are capable of creating a project that is fun and helps them learn new things on the way. Teachers meanwhile, might tend to put their own stress in the work, due to their break being cut down for a project. Many people tend to see students in a bad light. Such as, irresponsible, lazy, and forgetful. Rather than putting them in this bad light, we can give them a chance to choose their own learning style over the summer. Is summer break really about having fun or just having work?\n \n Many adults and teachers tend to see students in a bad light; such as: irresponsible, lazy, and forgetful. When in reality it is due to them not being motivated. When there is a chance; like this, to give a student a way to teacher themselves in their own unique way. Self-motivation is what most 'lazy' or 'irresponsible' students need when it comes to their own education. Taking these small steps, may help many students to improve their self confidence and motivation when it comes to school work. Why constantly putting students in a bad life for their past behavior, when we have a chance for them to give themselves some motivation when it comes to school work?\n \n When the time hits for summer, teachers and students want to relax, but also continue learning at the same time. Teachers tend to not realize their students limits when it comes to work. Students need self-motivation when it comes to school work sometimes. To help their education and stress levels, why not let students make their own project for the summer, for their benefit?",

    ESSAY:
      "Summer projects, although tidious and time consuming, are important. They are given to students by teachers to allow the students to retain the knowlege they have previously learned. They might also be given to teach the students new concepts before they enter the new school year. This allows teachers to teach a new concept at a faster pace since the students already taught it to themselves over the break. These project are very common in higher level classes because they require a higher level of understanding. These projects should be student-designed. I think that student-designed projects are a more efficient way for students to learn the required material over the summer break. It gives the students the flexibility that teacher-designed projects don't give. This is because students can design the project to their specific learning style and schedule and it allows the students to explore their creative side.\n \n If students design their own projects they have the ability to cater to their own learning needs. Some students are visual learners. Some benefit from repitition. Each student is vastly different from next. For example, if someone knew that they were a visual learner, they could draw pictures about the topic that they are learning about. They could illustrate a storyboard about a major war or make a cartoon about how to solve a math problem. They would not benefit from making flashcards and memorizing words because their brain deems those tactics boring. When someone's brain recognizes something as fun and enjoyable, it is more awake and ready to work. This also allows the students who don't know the best way that their brain retains information to explore and find what works best for them. This could help students in the long run by making them aware of what tactics they can use to study for tests.\n \n Students, especially high school and college level ones, usually have extremely full schedules. On the days they don't have extracurricular activities, they have work or home responsibilities. The range of what keeps a student busy is enormous. From a part-time job to band practice, students are overwhelmed with endless responsibilies. Allowing students to design their own summer projects gives them the ability to set their own work load. This takes some of the pressure off and still gives them the time to focus on other things in their lives. If a student only has two hours in their day to do school work, they won't design a project that requires them to research a topic for three hours a day and then write about it for two more hours. They will make something that allows them to research a quick topic and write a short paragraph so they can get in their eight hours of sleep.\n \n Schools focus on challenging their students academically and they champion the students who thrive in the athletic department. Schools usually fail to give any attention to the students who excel in being creative and having problem solving skills. Student-designed school projects would allow those students to thrive in making up a unique and efficient way to learn a new concept. It would also be beneficial to the students who struggle in that area, allowing them to practice and explore new ideas. As a student who stuggles in being original and creative, I would be forced to research new ways of learning. It would make me practice thinking outside of the box which is an important skill that can be applied outside of a school setting and in the workplace.\n \n Although student-designed projects allow students to make projects to their specific learning style and schedule and allows the students to explore their creative side, there are also things that teacher-designed projects are more efficient at. Teacher-designed projects make sure that what is needed to be learned, is actually learned. If a student designs their own project based on a broad topic, they may miss key terms or ideas that are essential to understanding the whole topic. When a project is guided by the teacher's instructions, students are less likely to be confused. There is also the chance that a student designs a project so they do not have to do any work. They can make one that requires them to only write their name on a piece of paper. Most projects are already teacher-designed and not many people have trouble understanding them. If students were to start designing their own projects it may leave students confused and unprepared for their class when the school year starts.\n \n I think that teacher-designed projects can be beneficial, but not to every student. Allowing the students to make their own projects makes certain that every student will learn the material in their own style and at their own pace. When teachers design projects, many students don't understand and are left behind. Even though some students may design a project that is incredibly simple, not all students want self-sabatoge like that. Most students understand that summer work can set them up for success during the school year. I think that the pros outweigh the cons on allowing students to design their own summer projects. Student-designed projects allow students to learn by their own style, learn at their own pace, and explore and implement their creative ideas.Â",

      "When was the last time you have been assigned a project over summer break? My last summer project was this past summer. It was a history project that took me days to complete. All I remember was dreading to work on the project because I already knew the information that it was about. Instead of the summer project being only a review, it should have been both a review and new information. Students get bored learning the same thing over and over again. They need something to help them for the upcoming year as they enter a new class. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because students would learn better, use their creative ability, and be more motivated to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should not be about keeping the student busy. They should be about preparing the student for the new class along with helping the student retain past information. If the projects were student-designed, then students would be more likely to learn better. When I was in tenth grade, our task was to create our own project based off a certain number of topics that were given to us. I chose to do my project about World War Two. Since I chose something that I am interested in, I learned a lot of new information and information that I already knew. If I was assigned a project about old civilizations, then I probably wouldn't have learned as well as I did. This is a prime example showing how a student-designed project will help a student learn better.\n \n Creativity is something that is difficult to express for students. There are very little opportunities to express who you really are in school. Every small chance that a student gets to show their personality is an opportunity. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed. Furthermore, if a summer project was student-designed, then that student will have a ton of opportunities to create something that represents them. For example, an artsy student might pick a project that involves drawing or painting. An athletic student might pick a project that involves a challenge. Finally, a studious student might do a project that has a lot of work. The possibilities are endless. Having each and every student express who they are can inspire many in and out of school. This is only the second reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n The last reason summer projects should be student-designed is because the students would be more motivated to complete the project. Summer is the only time that students have a long-tern break. They don't think about school or learning too often. The last thing they want to think about is another project that their teacher assigned to them. Their motivation to complete this project is very low. The only way to help motivate students would be to allow the project to be student-designed. It needs to be a project that they will enjoy doing. It can't be just another project that the teacher assigns just because why not. Last year, in chemistry, I was allowed to pick my project for my end of year science research project. I picked a topic that I wanted to see the outcome of. Throughout the entire project, I was motivated to complete it. This is because I chose what I wanted to do. Some people might say that a student can be motivated to complete a project even if it is teacher-designed. The counter to this is that when a student designs a project that they are interested in, the likelihood for that student to complete the project increases greatly. This is because they know what they want to learn about and what is interesting for them. Every little bit of motivation can help a student learn more than they thought.\n \n As you can see, student-designed projects are way better than boring teacher-designed projects. These were only just a few reasons why student-designed projects are better. Now that you know which one is better, I encourage all people to advocate around their community to make this a reality. Every student should be able to do a project on what they want to learn about. If we all used our voice to express our thoughts, then our planet would be a much better place in and outside of school.",

      "Some schools are required to assign assignments to their students to do a summer project during their summer break, but I believe that students should'nt be required to have summer projects. And I also believe that student should have a student-designed say in this because it's their choice based on if they would rather have summer assignments or not. I get it teachers want students to have summer assignments so that they're still learning but if students have assignments during their time off is that even summer break if students still have to do work during thier break.\n \n One reason why I believe that students should'nt have summer projects is because it is summer and student just want to enjoy their break and have fun. Student should have a say in this is because it's their choice if they would like to do summer projects or just enjoy and relax. I think most student would rather pick having fun and relaxing over summer projects, because for nine months students are going at least to 7 classes for nine months and learning new things, also doing projects, homework, classwork and more. If students had to have a vote for summer assignments or having a summer break without any summer projects, the majority of the students would pick summer break without any summer projects.\n \n Another reason why I believe students should design summer projects is because some students might get overwhelmed and very stressed out. School can be really stressful especially if you're failing some of your classes and getting a lot of work. Another reason why I think school is stressful is because you have seven classes and most teachers asign assignments to their students, this can be stressful for students because they have a lot of work to finish and some assignment are due the next or next class and they have to think about their other class assignments. Most students have a job and they won't have time to their summer assignment or they either went to vaction because summer time is about relaxing and having no worries, it should be a stress free summer. Summer is a time to enjoy while there is no school or no work assignments, summer break is a time to spend time with family and go to fun places and explore new things and places, not just doing school work while it is summer break.\n \n The final reason why I believe that student should have a say in summer project is because students should have a good time off. Students should'nt have summer projects because some students might go to summer school and have to do more work on top of summer projects, while they're doing summer school work , it could lead to some students not doing the summer project because summer school is too much stress for them. When student are in school they aren't really going on vaction or they aren't going out as much having fun because of school. The majority of the student don't want to miss school because if they miss school for a day it can back up them up from learning and not knowing anything that is going on in class. And summer break is about going out on vaction and exploring new things and adventure's, also not having to worry what time they have to be home for school or doing any assignment because it is summer break they should be able to enjoy it until school starts again. The majority of students don't go out on school day or during the weekends because they're either busy, working or just don't have time, that's why we have summer break so that we can relax and have fun and not worry about summer assignments.\n \n In conclusion these are the three main reasons as to why I believe that students should be students should not be assigned summer projects , so that they can enjoy their summer vaction off and being stress free until school starts again, I also believe that all students and staff should have off so that they all get a break and time off to relax and have family time.Â",

      "For most, summer is filled with unwinding from the stresses of school, traveling to new places, and learning new skills. This break is given to students to relax and reflect on all of their hard work. Summer allows students to find activities that they are passionate about. Summer assignments should be student-designed because this allows students to determine the extent and length, the topic, and the platform the project will take place on. This break in between moving onto the next level of education is meant for students to distress and enjoy life outside of school. Surely, making the summer projects more student-based allows for scholars to continue to learn, while also allowing students to enjoy time off.\n \n An important part of growing as a person and figuring out what career path to go down in the future is exploring possible interests. This break from the school year allows for students to do this outside of school, as well as time given to relax. If the length of the projects assigned over the summer are chosen by teachers, the students could end up with a big work load which takes away from their opportunities. Many students get jobs over the summer to gain work experience before furthering their education after high school. Not only does this help them build their transcript and resume before moving onto a new chapter in life, but it also allows them to figure out what they like do versus what they do not like to do. Students who are overwhelmed with summer projects are more inclined to not get a job or participate in the things they like to do, which defeats the purpose of the break.\n \n Another positive outcome of student-designed projects is students can have a say in what they want to research. If the students are allowed to pick the topic of their projects that have to do with the associated class, they are more likely to have better work and learn more. Again, this break is given to scholars to allow them to enjoy life outside of school. By giving students no say in the topic they are furthering their learning on, they are less inclined to do their best work or even any work at all. Having students pick the topic of their summer assignments would surely make the projects more enjoyable and easier for the students to complete.\n \n Finally, the last component that students should be able to determine for their summer projects is the platform they use to complete the project. Hands-on students prefer to do projects on a poster board, while more tech-savvy students would prefer to use Google slides or Prezi to present their work. Giving students a say in the way they are able to complete their project makes it a lot more enjoyable for them, essentially making it easier to complete. There are many different types of learners like people who prefer to visualize the topic they are learning about or people who would rather hear more on the topic. More visual learners may have better time comprehending the subject of the project if they can add visuals to the projects by hand. Audible learners may want to listen to videos regarding the topic and film a podcast discussing their work to better process the research they have done.\n \n Student-designed projects allow for better learning and understanding of the topic, while still allowing students to enjoy their time off from school. Although, student should have a say in the subject, length, and platform of their summer projects, teachers should also set boundaries for these projects. It would be pointless for students to study a topic not relating to the class at all. Teachers could provide students with a list of subjects to research that they can pick from. There should also be guidelines that pertain to the length of the project because it is unfair if some students work really hard on the summer projects, yet others slack off for the same grade. However, the students should have some say in the amount of work they chose to do. Students should also be given multiple platforms to choose from, but not completely free range. The risk with giving students a free range of platforms is students could use platforms that teachers are not familiar with. Students should be given the choice of the topic, length, and platform concerning their summer assignments with teacher guidelines. It is important to keep students learning, while also letting them participate in the things they are passionate about.",

That is not always fun, especially for students when they have summer break.\n \n Everyone loves to relax and not do anything. That is what summer vacation is for, it allows people, especially students to have some quality time off. Students do not always do their homework, from personal experience that is true. That is why they have less chance of doing projects during the summer when they can be relaxing instead. If they are giving the option to select their own projects they desire, they will more likely finish the project and have fun while doing it.\n \n That allows students to stay interested in a certain topic they love to learn about. This makes projects during break way more fun, and it increases the chances of students doing the projects. From personal experience, learning about topics I am passionate about or interested in, makes it way more fun to research and learn about.\n \n People might disagree that students do not don't care about their projects, or that they won't do it, regardless what topic it is about.

Yet some schools believe that their students need to continue to study, and learn over this long break. Summer is a time that has always been advertised as a time to go on vacation and put down all the books for a series of weeks to have fun. Yet for some students this isn't an option some teachers assign rigorous assignments for students to complete which can completely control and ruin theirÂ time off. By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is adequate and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.\n \n If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.",

      "One time in the 5th grade me and my classmates were given an assignment that we were told to design by ourselves. We were told to choose any format to present our projects and allowed to present it on any topic as long as it related to science. As the deadline for the project drew near many students talked about how they had not completed the project because they lacked direction. As a result many students received bad grades and teachers struggled to grade individual projects on the same scale due to varying formats and topics. Many schools are questioning whether summer assignments should be designed by students or teachers. Mandatory summer projects shouldÂ be designed by teachers to guarantee that students have a clear understanding of requirements and continue to learn over the break.\n \n Educators best understand the curriculum students need to keep up with. In the majority of schools different departments are run by teachers working together to design the courses. If summer projects are designed by the same teachers then schools can ensure that the assignments will help students prepare for upcoming classes.\n \n Additionally, these projects can give a general idea of how the class will be taught and how difficult the course will be. This way students can get a head start on the material and have a complete understanding of what will be required.\n \n When designing tasks teachers can ensure that students are given enough work to learn. Over the summer of my freshman year I was given a project where students were allowed to choose which book they read and write a report on it. Many students chose short novels and finished their assignments in only a day. This caused any potential learning to be lost as students mostly forgot about the assignment after completing it. Projects designed by teachers can ensure that students do enough work over their break to continue learning outside of school and that the work matches the level of the class.\n \n Teachers can give additional support and instruction on assignments they designed. When projects are created by students teachers may struggle to help them with questions they may have. In the English department at my school teachers all work together to design large projects so that anyone in the department can answer questions and help students. This leads to a better understanding among students but still allows them to create unique and individual products that promote growth.\n \n Projects assigned over long breaks should be designed by teachers because teachers can better understand the curriculum, ensure that students learn, and provide additional support on assignments. In the future more assignments could be created that allow students to get a glimpse at upcoming material. Long breaks that often cause students to lose touch with the rhythm of school can be turned into opportunities to prepare. We should all encourage the furthering of our education by demanding that schools around us help students learn over break and require teachers to design summer projects for students.Â  Â Â Â",

    ESSAY:
      "During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more effective regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.\n \n To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more effective and helpful for a student in the long run.\n \n Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more effective. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.\n \n Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more effective regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may effectively design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more effective if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be effectively prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also effectively make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.\n \n As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more effective than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more effective, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.",

      "Summer projects are often assigned to students to ensure learning continues over the summer. They help keep students' hands moving and gears turning. Projects are typically designed by teachers, however, when made by students the work load is easier to handle and is best fitted to each, individual student. Teachers can't always make classwork fun and engaging. By having a student make their own project, it takes the work load off the teacher and gives the student work they will enjoy doing. Additionally, most projects made by teachers have the same structure, therefore, it would be easier for students to cheat. Lack of supervision and a surplus of free time can lead to unwantedÂ collaborations.\n \n Everyone knows students dislike school, It has loud teachers and bone numbing A/C. Students are constantly falling asleep in class, not listening, and avoiding work. Being assigned a project over their sunny Summer break must be a bummer, right? That's what most people think, but assigning work that students have more liberty over can give them the upper-hand. They can choose a project that they have the supplies for, set it so it doesn't take much effort or time, and not to mention, they can be creative! They get an opportunity to explore something they're passionate about. And when a student is passionate about something, they make sure everyone knows.\n \n Projects take up time. In the Summer, time is in excess. Giving out a project makes sure they always have something to do. Students loose a lot over their break, they come back to school perplexed at a simple math problem. Take Generic_Name into example, she's an A-B student but every summer she looses what she learned that school year and it takes a few weeks for her to get back on track. Usually her first report card has C's and even D's. But one summer in 10th grade she was assigned two projects and her first report card in 11th grade had ALL A's! She was way ahead of the class and felt more confident when completing her assignments. Practice is key to gaining knowledge. With students tongue tied, Summer projects help turn their question marks into exclamation points!\n \n The teacher may also get a better understanding of his/her students. They get to see what they like, what inspires them, what makes them mad, what makes them said or what they have strong opinions on. It makes it easier to relate to a generation that seems illegible on the exterior. Kids can be confusing, especially with the professional relationship of teachers and students. They can't be as personal with their students, even then, there's too many to even try!\n \n Student-made projects give teachers an easy window into their individuality. Future projects may also improve and become better suited to the audience. Complaints about the complexity or disappointment of their assignment will disappear. And, yet again, the work load that is removed. No more stressing about what they should learn, just some simple guidelines and grading rubric. They could even make their own!\n \n Teachers put a lot of effort into their job, some would say the most out of any job. Their own money and heart is put into their work. They buy students supplies and are even are taught as if they were the teacher's own! There will always be that one kid that wants to show off and ends up biting off more than he can chew. Teachers give great structure by making it themselves. Projects are also easier to grade because they would all have the same structure. Summer projects can be a great way to keep minds growing over that long break, it just depends on the situation as to who should create the project.",

      "Almost everyone who attended school can attest to how boring and tedious summer work can be. Whether it's assigned reading or a project, students often dislike having schoolwork cut into their summertime. However, it is a necessary evil, and although there are compelling arguments for self-directed learning and independent study, the fact remains that it's the teacher's job to know how to help their students learn. Summer work should be designed via a partnership of students and teachers, so that students can learn in ways that interest them and help them grow, and teachers can ensure that the material is taught correctly.\n \n While the intervention of teachers in this process may seem to be too controlling or unnecessary, the fact remains that they have gone through a lengthy process to ensure that they are trained to teach the material as effectively as possible. They go through an extensive process involving obtaining at least a bachelor's degree as an undergraduate student (and in many cases going even further and pursuing post-graduate studies), spending time as a student teacher, obtaining other certifications, and taking part in continuing teacher training throughout their careers. The experience and education that teachers have is simply too much to ignore when considering the development of a student's summer project or curriculum.\n \n Another factor to consider when advocating for students developing their own projects or curriculum is that all students are different. Some may not design their own work with their own best educational interests in mind, and others may not do as well learning via a highly structured summer project or curriculum. Yes, some students are very bright or passionate and will diligently undertake projects and studies on their own, but that is not true for all students. Everyone learns differently, and many people thrive in situations where they have specific guidelines and rules to follow or goals to meet. The wide range of learning and personality types in schools is a major reason why summer projects and curricula should be a collaborative effort between students and teachers. No two students learn the same, so why should they be forced to do the same work?\n \n Although there are many good reasons for students doing projects that were designed by a teacher, it is also important to consider the fact that teachers may simply be out of touch with how their students wish to learn. Student-designed work can be incredibly fulfilling upon completion; the student will have identified an area of study they enjoy, pursued and researched it, and hopefully will have reached a fulfilling conclusion through a project, experiment, or assignment. However, all of this can be accomplished to its fullest potential with the help of an adult. A trusted mentor (such as a teacher), can be an invaluable resource to a young person undertaking a major project on their own.\n \n Much of education deals with absolutes. Standardized testing, graduation requirements, etc., etc. One can go on and on describing all of the things that individuals must do to conform with the school system. All of this is necessary to ensure that all students find success. However, summer work is a wonderful opportunity for a student's individuality to shine through, and with the help of a teacher, they can design work that will be fulfilling and extremely educational.",

      "Should summer projects be teacher designed or student designed?\n \n Student's should be able to design their own summer projects. Why? because it's their summer and if it's a boring project that a teacher assigned it's most likely not going to get done , because it don't catch the student interest if the student design their own project they created it's most likely to get done because it's something that he/she likes.\n \n Teacher design might not be what the students are interested in , and they might not understand it. If the student creates their design it could be fun and easy for them, and they will be learning from it as well, and they will understand it more because they are make whatever out of it. They could do it in their own way which will also make them determine to complete their own design they created.\n \n Students design could also help the teachers too , they wouldn't have to do much planning cause the students have to come up with their own designs so the students have to come out with ideas on their own. The students will be engaged because they have to focus on what they will come up with for their design for this summer project also the enjoyment they would get out for creating their own design project. The students will be learning it in their own way that's not boring to them. That way it will keep them motivated and interested while they are working on their project.\n \n Student's should have a right to do something that would be entertaining to them since it's the summer and they have to work on it so they can continue to learn. If teachers design it , it might not engaged the student's as if they could design it their self. If students design their own project it will be easier for them to complete it while having fun creating it. The students will be determine to actually do their project during the summer because they designed it and liked it.\n \n Most people would agree that students should be able to design their own project because its something that they would be interested in and it's a summer project, while they design the project they could be exploring the world, and they would come up with a lot of good designs for the project because they are learning a lot of new things each and everyday and that's why i think this statement is true that students should design their own summer project rather than a teacher design the student's project.

      "Work over the summer sounds boring enough, it creates less time to have fun over the summer break. However, what if it was the students to design the summer project, that can be based on a interest, a hobby, or an activity. In addition, if this was a possibility, creativity can shine on a student project, and a sense of pride upon working, so while doing work, student can enjoy of what they enjoy, share their ideas and passion. While others believe, that teacher should designed the summer projects; However, if the summer project was a student design, it'll benefits students and gives freedom to work on what they are interested.\n \n If were to be students designing a summer project for school, it brings out the creativity and how its unique from comparing other student's projects. Also, this summer project can spark a students passion or ideas to share, and create a voice for themselves. Moreover, student designed project, can cause less vulnerability of copying others projects, it creates a space where everyone is unique in their own way. I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.\n \n From the project, there was not a lot of commitmentÂ for sharing ideas. ProcrastinationÂ happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot ofÂ encouragementÂ to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.\n \n In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share.Â",

But there are some schools who do give their kids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their break and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can make time to work and pick their own deadlines, make their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.\n \n Students should be able to make time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.\n \n Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already know what they need to know, and by making them do something they don't know at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't know during the school year and now they have to learn it during there break.\n \n A teachers goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to make their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.\n \n Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it.Â",

      "Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.\n \n If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?\n \n When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student canÂ do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.\n \n Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.\n \n Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.",

Students already go through so much during the school year, whether it be drama with another student, annoying teachers, bullying, and even fights, so when school is over students just want to get away from it all. Most of the time students will go see a parent, or go out of town, so they wonÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â´t even have time to do a project.\n \n My other reason is that teachers make projects to complicated. Most teachers give projects at least twice a year, and one of the two will always be to complicated to do. Teachers know that students go out of town during the summer, but they will still give you a super complicated project just because youÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â´ll have the whole summer to do it.\n \n Some people might think that summer projects should be teacher-designed because the project grade might help their grade out, but what if you fail the project?

    Essay:
      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects...should these projects be teacher-designed or student designed? Summer is a moment that shouldn't be taken away by work. As a student it;s best for summer break projects to be designed by students. Although some may disagree that student-designed projects are effective; with a student-designed project time management can develop, more relate-ableÂ projects and creativity can be produced, and principals of cooperation/social skills can be established.\n \n Firstly, time is just as potent as life itself. As an adult time management is key in the world of work. However, the younger generations of students, and children do not process this until later in life. The time difference in constructing, doing, and presenting a project can be comparable to real world activities such as: writing a report with a crunched due date, getting to a destination in a reasonable amount of time, utilizing and enhancing a persons' morning routine to get out the house more early, and many more real world tasks. Time is just as important as breathing everyday, and with having student-designed projects, students can gain these experiences at an early age; with replication, the success rate of younger adults will increase.\n \n Secondly, doing the same activities every year such as: large research papers, extensive PowerPoint, and book reports can be repetitive; especially during summer vacation when both students and teachers alike get a break from the constant working. Students designing projects can prove beneficial; however, not only to the students themselves but teachers and even the environment along side. The creative factor in a simple project can increase for example, a science study project that involves a class taking a trip to a zoo or animal shelter for studies. Giving the class a opportunity to decide on summer projects can also tie into the immersion of summer vacation. Instead of being that book report, a person can interview others who like or dislike the book and gain criticism, knowledge, and information from a vast prospective. Not only with creativity, having the ability to relate to the studentÂ can be a opportunity to increase overall contribution of students in projects over the summer.\n \n In addition, communication is important and a staple point in our economy. Allowing students to design summer projects can put the basic skills of cooperation and socialization to use. Understanding and accepting cooperation can place a person in a better position in life than someone who refuses to cooperate with others. And cooperation is needed life after high schoolÂ examples such as: getting assistance on business, buying objects such as houses and a vehicle, working along side coworkers you don't like. Along with aiding the understanding of cooperation student-designed projects can be helpful for those who have trouble with socializing, anxiety for example. Placing a person within a group of like mindedÂ people with goal in mind can give one the opportunity to get assistance with anxiety and communication blocks throughout life.\n \n It is often argued that having teachers to designate projects can be more beneficial than having students do the task. Certainly there are those who claim teachers are more experienced, well organized, and can provide more clarification on requirements for the task at hand. However, role reversal and having the students design the projects can result in more creative ideas, have individuality or unique portrayals of each separate idea, and a overall better interest in the project itself. As a result this side is more effective because you can gain more interactions within the targeted group, more interest in the assignment as a whole, and lower levels of stress weighing on a person or group.\n \n As we have seen the argument of whether students or teachers should be designated to design projects runs on; having students design projects can be more of an improvement than a teacher. Simultaneously a teacher can gain more interest and interaction in the overall class, and boost the basic core skills of time management and cooperation. Not only strengthening a persons' individual skills but a persons skills to interact with the world after high school.",

      "Students are like baby chickens. They need a leader and proper guidance to ensure they prosper in life. Teachers can be and usually are that mother hen for their students. This applies to many circumstances whether it is in school, during the summer, or even after college. Planning projects in the summer, a perfect time for students to grow and expand their knowledge, is an area that most teachers are experts on. Some people may say projects given during the summer should be designed by the students. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed because students cannot be held accountable and need guidance.\n \n Summer projects should not be student-designed because students are not trustworthy. The majority of students will search for an easy way out and try to make the project as simple as possible. This is completely divergent to a teacher's mindset. They enjoy pushing students out of their comfort zone so they have a better chance to improve and grow. Students cannot be held accountable to design a summer project that will challenge their mind because of their lack of motivation. In addition, students are not responsible enough to be bestowed with the task of creating their own project. Without a doubt, they will prioritize relaxation and fun over learning and hard work, especially in the summer. As a repercussion, it is a waste of time for the student and teacher, since the student did not put forth their best effort. Some people may say students should create their own summer projects so they can take the initiative and learn to be independent. However, they are wrong because students cannot be held accountable for their actions due to their lazy mentalities. Teachers benefit from challenging students, which is why teacher-designed summer projects ensure that students continue to learn.\n \n Another reason teachers should design summer projects is because most students still need assistance and guidance. Teachers are more experienced in life and share their wisdom with children. Nevertheless, they know what activities and projects stimulate the brain and help students learn better. With this additional knowledge, they are better suited to plan and organize projects. For many students, their brain continues to develop and their pre-frontal cortex develops last. As a result, they rely on their amygdala, which is why they do not have the best decisionÂ making skills. When asked to create a project, some students do not know where to start because they need guidelines to accomplish a task. For this reason, teachers are always there to help and give guidance. They look out for their students and give encouragement because they want what is best for them. Many people say that schools should give students permission to design summer projects as a way to give them more freedom and allow them to express their creativity. Although, they are incorrect because students still need guidance since they do not have as much experience compared to adults and for the reasont that their brains are still developing.\n \n Clearly, summer projects should be teacher-designed due to the lazy mentalities and ongoing brain development of students. Children cannot be trusted to create their own project because they will not challenge themselves enough, especially compared to a teacher. Students still require guidance because their brain is still developing and teachers provide beneficial wisdom. It is essential that these projects stimulate the brain so student continue to learn over summer. Without a doubt, teachers should definitely create summer projects because if they didn't, students might be robbed of a prosperous future.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure we continue learning during break. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? As a student, I strongly believe that the summer projects should be student-designed. Even though teachers will disagree, they're wrong! When a student gets to choose what he or she does for their project, I know that we'll have more fun completing it and we'll be given the chance to become more creative than what a teacher would make us do.\n \n Summer break is suppose to be fun. If a teacher gave us a project, we'd be sitting at home, all alone, inside reading about a great adventure, when we could be having our own! Instead of writing a boring paper, with no enthusiasm, about someone else experience, we could have the chance to go out and make our own. Then, the paper would be full of passion. I would rather design my own project that would not only make my teachers happy, but will let me have fun while completing it!\n \n Another great reason students should design their summer project, is because is gives us the chance to become creative. Creativity inspires us to thrive and do our best. For example, a few years ago I was told to come up with a way to show how bullying can change ones life. I had a great idea! I went around the school and asked ten people if they were ever bullied. If they said yes, I asked them how it changed their life, or if it even did. I wrote down everything they said, and decided to make a short play. The play was about a little girl who was bullied her entire life, and the things she stopped doing because of the bullies. The play showed everything the teacher wanted to know and more! I loved doing that project, and to this day I will never forget how proud I was and how much fun I had doing it! It gave me the chance to explore my creativity. I wish i could get the chance to do it again!\n \n I understand schools want us to continue to learn during our break, but that's why we should have fun while doing it! A student-designed project gives us the chance to have fun, make our own experiences and explore our creativity! When a student enjoys doing the project the outcome, or grade, will become a lot better. This is why I believe the student-designed projects would be better than any teacher-designed project. It gives us a chance to grow, not only as a student, but as a person too!",

    Essay:
      "I think Summer projects should be teacher designed rather than leaving the student to their own devices. For reasons like having an idea already set for the students, making it so the students don't get too lost, and if the teacher came up with the topic for the project then there's be more summer than work stuffs.\n \n Now then, when an idea is already laid out for someone, it becomes faster for then to think of more ideas from the base of the first example. For book reports and the like, its already hard because you have to choose from a list of books that you probably don't want to read,* but it gives you a bit of simpleness to get to choose a book that is meant to be read during summer.\n \n Now comes the topic of getting lost within your own thought as you try to think of an idea that wasn't preset for you already. Getting lost is inevitable in some cases, but when there's no prompt to start you off, it becomes a lot harder to follow up with good ideas.\n \n When it's the teacher or school that comes up with essay prompts, you'll have a much easier time since it saves up time from your summer. Book report prompts are usually made so that they're going to take a while before you finish them; but since those all have prompts already set by the school, they don't take as long as they would.\n \n The question that this prompt asks is vague as it is, but the fact that I wrote this much based off of that makes it seem less vague and more just difficult to interpret. Summer projects being teacher designed is what all students have gotten used to at this point in time; and it would be wrong to switch it up on the next generation of students to make them come up with their own ideas from nothing to base them off of.",

      "As a child, usually in summer you are assigned a summer book assignment or any task to keep your brain working over the summer. Many children complain about this and say it is pointless and would prefer to do there own projects and not ones assigned to them by teavchers. They feel as if it would be much easier and would not have to do as much work. But, teachers knowwing topics for kids to work on, them knowing requirements and what thy NEED to lear, and pushing the students by giving them not easy tasks shows that teachers should be the ones designing summer projects\n \n Teachers got to where they are in life and there career from one very huge cause, knowing what they are teaching and talking about to students. There whole jobs purpose iis to understand topics and briefly explain them to students, They spend years learning so much so they have so much more experience on topics and what would challenge students and help them grow. While some people may think students do know topics very well and would e able to challenge themselves, teachers give everyone that extra oush which is much needed because at the end of the day they just want to see all of their students succeed.\n \n Along ith teachers knowing what to teach students and how to explain it to them, they also know what requirements are needed for projects and wgat students need to do to be able to get good grades. Rubics tae several days to be created, sometimes teachers caan not do it alone they go over it with there peers. They do this to help students be strong and do good on there assignemnts to show that if they work hard they will rcieve a fair grade for the amount of work they put in. Even though some students may make requirements hard so they can push themselves, many would also try to make it as easy as possible so they do't have to spend tht much time on it and enjoy there summer. Teachers make requirements that are not extreme but they are necessary so students do not slack and if they choose to there grade will show it.\n \n Many teachers have multpile years of experience and have seen so many of there former students take so many different paths in life. Teachers try there absolute hardest to push students to help them grow and becoe mature and responsible young men and women. Because even though it may seem like they do not care what happens to you, they do bcause they have a huge impact on your life. As one of my teachers had said, the hardest thing about teaching is seeing someone not come out of there lass to do good with there lives, they push each and every student in hopes that they will encourage them to succeed and drive in life to be succcesful. Some students may think that there teacher doe not care, but they do and they try to ush you mentaly to try to make you stronger.\n \n Very many students would love to create there own work fo them to do over the summer. Some may say it ill be easier for them to create there own work because they know how far to push themselves. But, teachers knowing topics better than students, knowing specific requirements needed, and the, pushing students past there limit to try to help them grow shows why TEACHERS should be the ones designing summer assignments.

      "Many schools incorporate summer learning into their students' curriculum to have them maintain knowledge gained throughout the school year. Although these projects are thought to be beneficial for students, the topics and activities given by teachers are often strenuous, and frankly, uninteresting to students, especially during their summer break. Summer projects assigned to kids should be allowed to be student designed to fit the student's interests, keep the child engaged, and to promote responsibility when constructing a project.\n \n As a child grows, so do their interests and beliefs. Allowing student designed projects means letting them take control and organizing their own thoughts in which they see fit. By letting kids create a project based on their interests, it enables them to stay engaged on what they are working on, and to be able to put in their best effort and ideas into their assignment. A child's own ideas would mean better grades and a better concept of the topic they have chosen.\n \n Students must be taught responsibility, and by allowing them to create their own rubrics, guidelines, and ideas, it promotes creativity and a sense of control in a child's mind. By allowing this flexibility of guidelines and rules, kids can stretch their ideas further without having to feel they have gone off-topic because it will be designed by them.\n \n Although some might claim that teacher designed summer projects are more structured and educational for students, this is a flawed argument because most assignments given by teachers are strict and are only focused on a certain topic that not every student will take interest in. It's also important to give students a chance to be creative with their own guidelines and requirements, something that is restricted when a rubric designed to a teacher's expectations is given. Students would simply thrive more if handed an assignment they could create and build on their own.\n \n In conclusion, schools should begin leaning more towards student designed summer assignments because of the immense freedom that is given and the responsibility that is required of students to create their own projects. It is important that from a young age, kids are able to write, discuss, and learn more about topics they are passionate about, and it is even more important that we do not limit their creativity because of the idea that projects should be teacher designed.",

      "Over Summer break, certain students are required to complete projects to ensure that they're learning during their time off of school. Summer projects are quite beneficial to students; they allow students to become more knowledgeable about a subject during the process of completion. Although, a few factors should be considered when creating them. These types of projects should be designed by teachers since they're aware of the curriculum, it'll avoid students from making it too easy, and it could potentially benefit the students.\n \n When teaching, the teachers must teach according to the school's curriculum. They also have a complex understanding of the material that they share with their students. With this knowledge, they'll know what to include when designing the projects. Not only do these assignments encourage the students to learn, but some teachers assign these projects based on the new material they'll be learning when they come back. Therefore, they will be prepared for the new unit when it's introduced to them at school.\n \n A majority of students come to school prepared and eager to learn. The rest of those students are typically known to be lazy or carefree when it comes to schoolwork. If they get the opportunity to design a summer project, some of them might take a shortcut, which may defeat the purpose of the project. Without authority, numerous students obtain the idea to go after something they normally wouldn't go for if they had a sense of authority. Some will put in zero to no effort into designing the projects.\n \n The purpose of assigning these projects to students is to ensure that they keep learning. Certain students won't gain much knowledge if they're not given the right tools to learn. Another factor that comes into play is that kids sometimes feel pressured when a teacher expects them to fulfill something. Sometimes they need a sense of direction when they're clueless about what to do; lack of direction may sometimes lead to confusion.\n \n With these reasons in mind, teachers should design summer assignments for their students, instead of the other way around. Students will be ready to absorb more knowledge and will be able to understand the material in a deeper meaning. Overall, teachers know what's best for their students. If the projects are done in an organized manner, this may guarantee success into a student's school career.",

    Essay:
      "Summer and projects are two words that dont go well together especially for some students. Summer is a season to be enjoyed by many no one is in school and a lot of people are out on beaches or vacationing and having a good time. However, some teachers assign projects during summer and some hate it and most rarely do some enjoy it. Teachers assign projects so that students dont forget what they learned in school, but many argue should the project be teacher or student designed. Summer projects should be more student designed because they are more creative, they have more ideas and it makes them a better thinker.\n \n One reason projects should be student- designed is because they are more creative. Many projects that are offered in education systems are always one sided or the same. Many teens during school tend to do projects but they think its boring what the teacher assigned them. They need to be more creative. They could use different colors or different things to make it their own way.\n \n For example, a student in school had to do a project that she didnt want to do, so instead of doing what she was suppose to, she decide to think outside the box and do her own thing. The teacher got mad at the teen but the teen said It's better to be creative then do the same thing as the others. While some may say that being creative cant get you anywhere, those type of people would be wrong.\n \n Many famous celebrities and scientists got to where they are or were because they had to be creative to reach that high. Furthermore, being creative on school projects makes one different and unique and many teens today should do that.\n \n Another reason projects should be student- designed is because they have more ideas. With many projects assigned they are usually being given a specific thing they have to work on. Many teens, however, dont want to do just one thing they want to be expressive and show how many ideas they really have. During class a teacher assigned a project that any students disagreed on, and many told the teacher that they didn't want to do that. The teacher asked the students what they wanted to do and many of them responded with different ideas about how to do it and what they wanted to do it on. in the end, the teens came up with more ideas that even she couldn't think of and assigned them to do whatever they had brought up or though of. Some will argue that more ideas isnt always better, but that would not be correct.\n \n Many companies or businesses in today's society come come up with more and more ideas to keep their companies going, and to them the more ideas they have the better. Therefore, it is essential to having more ideas for summer projects is better because it gives you more think about, and is better than one specific idea.\n \n The third and final reason why summer projects would be student- designed is because it makes students a better thinker. In today's schools many teens are tired and sleepy. When adults or others assign them something like a project or anything thingÂ really, many complain that they are boring or dumb. When it comes to doing projects students have a hard time doing them. Mostly because they dont like what they are doing or because they simply dont want to do it.\n \n Students would be so much more ecstatic to do a project if they could just do the way they want to do it. During the summer a teen had to do a project on something she didnt really want to do,so they about day after day, night after night until it finally clicked into in their head. They were going to do a project that no one had yet to think of. After days of thinking and hours of working he had perfected his project. Since he had to think more about what he was going to do it took him longer but in the end it ll worked out for him.. Others may say that on test and presentations and even homework he wouldnt have to think as hard and the only reason he thought so hard was because they were working on a project but that would be false.\n \n You would still have to think hard on tests to know how to get the answer, on presentations you would have to think how to set it up and all. and for homework you would have to use your mind to answer the question. The project helped him think harder and because of that he was also able think better during his school performances. Projects may not always be the best but they can improve one's thinking ability.\n \n Many school or summer projects should be a student- designed because they are more creative, they have more ideas and it also makes them a better thinker. Students and even teachers have the ability to choose what they want to do and no one can stop them from doing it.\n \n Some students may be scared to choose their own path or their own way but depending on what they are doing it can all wok out for the better and can become a much better person for it. Sometimes choosing a way that everyone goes isnt always the right one or correct one. For example, like on a project many students may choose to do one thing, while oneself wants to do something in a completely different direction. By all means, do whatever is best for oneself, instead of what others want to do.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â",

      "Student-Designed Summer Projects\n \n Schools across the nation have chosen to require their students to complete summer projects during their break. This requirement is designed to assure that students continue learning while they are outside of school. Though many schools agree on this idea, there is another debate surrounding the issue. Some agree that the projects should be designed by students, but others feel that they should be outlined by the teachers themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed because this would allow students to display their creativity, their true knowledge and abilities, and their overall work ethic.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because this would allow them to showcase their creativity. They would be able to choose the format of their own project. This could be anything from posters to online presentations. In addition, allowing students to have creative freedom over their projects would increase their interest in the idea of summer work. If they could create their projects using any format, they would be able to incorporate their own ideas and interests. A student who is interested in graphic design could use the Internet to create their project. On the other hand, a student who is interested in art could draw their own poster by hand. Letting students creatively design their own projects would allow them to learn even more. They would be able to explore new project formats and find new resources that they could then implement with future assignments.\n \n Another reason these summer projects should be student-designed is because it would allow students to exhibit their true knowledge and abilities. Without an explicit outline of what the students must incorporate into the project, they would need to determine what all should be included. This would allow them to show off their knowledge of the content at hand. This would also show their ability to separate important content from unimportant details. Teachers would be able to use the knowledge of their students' strengths and weaknesses to design future lessons and projects that would fit their particular group of students.\n \n The final reason that students should design their own summer projects is because it shows their true work ethic. By designing the format for their entire project, students would be able to show a commitment to their education. Projects that are designed poorly and thrown together at the last minute would show that those students did not put in very much effort. On the other hand, projects that are neat and organized show that they were put together with effort and precision. These students would clearly have the stronger work ethic. Knowledge of their students' work ethic could be very valuable to teachers.\n \n Though many people agree that student-designed projects would be more beneficial for the students, others disagree with this opinion. Some people believe that summer projects should be created by teachers instead. They argue that projects organized completely by the teachers would allow educators to ensure that students include all of the necessary content in an organized manner. Though this could be viewed as a slight advantage for teachers, it is outweighed by the many disadvantages of this idea. By not allowing students to design their own projects, teachers would be limiting their students' creativity. Outlining the projects completely would prevent students from placing their own creative spins on the projects, so teachers would end up with nearly identical projects from all of their students. It would also place more stress on the teachers. By not allowing students to have the creative reigns over their assignments, teachers are placing more work on themselves. Though the idea of teacher-designed summer projects might seem better, the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages.\n \n Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it would allow them to show off their creativity, their personal knowledge and abilities, and their individual work ethics. They would be able to display their creativity through their choice of format for their project. By creating their own designs for their projects, each student would be able to show off their ability to translate their knowledge into an appropriate format. Finally, the effort put into designing their project by each student would show teachers whether or not they possess the ability to work diligently on their assignments. Though teacher-designed projects would allow the teachers to ensure all projects are completely organized, student-designed projects allow students to incorporate their creativity and interests into their project design. Overall, students should design their own summer projects because this opportunity would allow them to take charge of their own education.Â",

    Essay:
      "Imagine walking into a new school year, having already learned some of the topics your teachers will teach this year and still memorize some of the stuff from last year. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure students continue to learn over their summer break. Should students be able to design what they want their projects to be or should the teachers design it? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will pick educated projects for their students, it will be harder for the teachers to answer questions and grade individual projects that the students came up with their self, they will know for sure the projects taught students things for their upcoming year. Here is all the reasons why the teachers should design the summer break projects.\n \n First, students might pick uneducated projects to do. Teachers will pick projects that help relate to what they learned in the class room. For example, students might pick what they are interest in, instead of picking what they need to learn to better their learning experience over the summer. Teachers are more likely educated than students about what the students will learn in there next grade level. So for instances, they will give them projects based off what students will need to know next year, to further their education for the next grade there are entering in. For these reasons teachers should be the one's to choose the projects for summer.\n \n Second, it will be easier for the teachers to answer question and grade the projects. If a student gets stuck and need help from a teacher, they can email the teacher an ask for help. If it was student-designed each student might have an individual project. It will be harder for the teacher to answer all of the questions, because he or she did not pick the project for the student. If the teachers come together they can figure out the right projects that can benefit the students education. This is another example for why the teachers should design the students projects.\n \n Lastly, some students might say that, by letting them design their own projects. It will not be boring and it will increase the rates of students actually doing the different projects over the summer. It will also make students put more effort into their individual projects. However, if they let the students decide then how will they know if their learning anything from there projects. It will be way easier if the teacher choose it because then they will know for sureÂ they will learn something educational while doing the projects.\n \n In conclusion, they should make the projects over the break teacher-designed, because teachers can give out educational projects, the students can ask questions about the projects the teachers have choosing and it is more easier for the teachers to grade, and they know that the teachers will choose what is best for the students to help them get through the year. To make it easier for the teachers they can all agree on what educational fun projects they want the students to do over the summer.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    Essay:
      "At a lot of schools summer projects are not given, but at some they are and they are given vigorously. If over the summer projects are given, they should be student-designed for many reasons. First off, letting a teacher decide what the students will do over summer will not only make the kids mad, it will also cause them to be less engaged with the topic and assignment. If the school allows the children to pick their topic, they will be more engaged because they are creating their own work from the bottom up. This will be more fun for the students and they will be more likely to complete the project. Summer projects should be student-designed to be fair to the kids, to make it more fun for the students, and to also further engage children with their work.\n \n The first reason to why summer projects should be student-designed is because that is the only way that it will be fair to the students. Kids will be able to choose what they want and start their own creation from scratch. Giving the students the same topic by the teacher will put some at a disadvantage. Some are not likely to complete the assignment because they do not want to do the topic assigned, and some will also not be comfortable with competing against their higher academically sound classmates. Another reason kids should be able to pick their own topics is because a lot of schools do not do summer projects in the first place. This is just to be fair to the class. Let them pick their own topics, do not add on to the kids' disengagement by telling them what they are going to do. It will also be easier for the kids to complete the assignment if they are able to choose it themselves. For example, this past semester, my history professor assigned my classmates and me a project about the history of the United States. Each student had the exact same topic and that made it very stressful. We all were trying to search the same things, and it sure made it harder to find the information when the teacher assigns a tough topic. Then on the other hand, this semester my professor has allowed each of us to pick our own topic. It has created a lot less stress and it is easier to find information on the topic when we are able to search it and find what we need. So, to be fair, let the students pick the topics of their choice and there will be a better outcome.\n \n The second reason of why the projects should be student designed is so that it will be fun for the kids. The students should be able to pick a fun topic of their choice, and not a rigorous topic that their professor assigns. This causes the students to be able to pick a more personal or relatable topic to them, that they then will want to complete. Letting children choose their topics will also assure that each project is different and that there is no way for them to cheat. When each student chooses their own topic, there will be color and diversity to each project. This will then make it easier to grade for the teachers. If each student had the same topic, it would be harder on the teacher to grade because they would be looking at the same thing for every student. It will be fun for them just like the students because they will be able to see what is going on in their students' minds, and how creative they can be. So, students should be able to pick their own summer project to make it more diverse and fun.\n \n The third topic adds on to the first two, and that is when the students are allowed to pick their own topic, they will be more engaged with their work.\n \n There will be more diversity and intensity among the work, A student will want to complete their work, because it actually means something and can be personal or emotional to them. Assigning the sudents a project based off of what the teacher wants is not smart. The professor should be able to come up with what the criteria requires, but let the students pick so they can be engaged. Students can also create some competition amongst themselves when they are able to choose their own topic. They will compete to see who can create the best work and see which one their teacher will like the most. Their minds will be able to explore and their work will represent how they feel and what the project meant to them.\n \n In conclusion, letting students pick the topic of their summer projects will have many benefits for the students and even the teachers. It will be more fun to the students and teachers. The students are able to let their minds explore and they are able to be engaged with the work that they have created. It will also be fun for the teachers because their grading will not be as tough and boring. With each student, they are able to see something new and what their students have thought of. There are no real disadvantages of this, as long as students stay in the guidelines of what they are supposed to do. And, that should be no problem if the students know exactly what to do. Summer projects are already enough of a hassle for the kids, so let them choose their own topics to be fair, fun, and create more engagement within the classroom.Â",

      "Most students, strongly dislike summer assignments, because when school is over we want to relax and enjoy our time off. But, what we don't realizeÂ is that these summer projects can be very helpful in the future. Once we go back to school, and as we get older and closer to graduate we try taking difficult and more advanced classes to bump our gpa. To be in these classes, most of the time, teachers assign summer assignments to give the students an idea of how the class is going to be and the certain skills you need to maintain to be in that class. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed because the teachers already know what the standards are in that class, and what objectives you need to be familiar with before coming into that class. Also, if a student were to design the summer projects, they might make it easy for their fellow peers and not work at their full potential.\n \n I believe that teachers should design the summer projects because they know what can benefit you as a student and want to see you succeed as much as possible. One reason why I think teachers should design the summer projects is that the teachers already learned the subjects they are teaching. So, they could create a summer project that could help the students understand the material the teachers struggled with learning when they were once students. Another reason why I think the summer projects should be teacher designed, is because the teachers probably have taught the class before and know what topics you need to be familiar with when you arrive to that class. Also, the teachers have had experiencesÂ with students in the past and know what skills and work ethic you need to succeed in that class. In my opinion I think that students required to complete the summer projects would be better off if it were designed by a teacher.\n \n If the summer projects were designed by the students I feel like the students wouldn't make it as challenging as the teachers would. I feel like the students wouldn't work to their full potential since they know the teacher didn't design the project. As a student, I think that sometimes we try to find an easy way out to complete an assignment and I think that the students would make the project not as challenging and in the future that could affect how we would do in the class and the easy project would reflect on our grade if we dont know the full material. Also I think that the students might not know the criteria as well as the teachers do, to assign a project on it.\n \n Overall, I think that the teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects because they have the experience and the students could ask them questions if they need to involving the project. The students would defiantly benefit from the teachers designing the project because it would give them an idea on how the class would be like in the next school year and would prepare them to strive in their classes. On the other hand, if the students were to design the summer projects they wouldn't know what topics to include, unlike the teachers that have had experiences with other kids completing their assignments in the past. In conclusion, I think that the students would be better off if the projects were teacher-designed.Â",

    Essay:
      "It is a common occurrence for teachers to assign work over the summer. There are many reasons for this, the most prominent being to keep students refreshed and ready for school and new classes after a long break. Many argue that the responsibility for the creation of these assignments should belong to the students, while others argue that the teachers should have the control in these assignments. The ones who should be responsible for the creation of these assignments is the teachers for a multitude of reasons, the main ones being that teachers have a better understanding of the next years content, they understand the skill level of the class as a whole much better than the students, and students can and will get lazy with assignment creation intending to slack off.\n \n The purpose of school is for students to learn new things and gain a more advanced thinking process, the point of the summer assignments is to prepare students for the new things they will be learning. The implications of this are that, if students made these assignments, they would not be able to prepare themselves for the next year and for what they don't know about. On the other hand teachers have gone to specialized college classes to teach their respective subjects and have a much deeper understanding of what it is they have to teach. These qualities allow them to best determine what a student must know and remember for the next year, because a student who doesn't know physics can't properly prepare themselves for a physics class. Vice verse a teacher who has a degree in physics knows exactly what they want their students to know and remember when they enter their class.\n \n Another reason in favor of having teachers create the summer assignments is the fact that they know their classes better than any singular student does. This ties in with how students don't know what is coming the next year in the way that the teacher has the most knowledge on what the class as a whole struggles on the most and therefore, can form assignments around this. While a group of friends can have knowledge on what each otherÂ struggles with they don't know about the rest of the class in the way teachers do. A teacher has access to all tests, quizzes, and basic assignments from their class, this information is not privy to the students and therefore a student can never truly understand what is needed in these assignments.\n \n The final reason for summer assignment creation to be put in the hands of the student is the common laziness and apathy that many students face. One simple sounding solution to the problem above would be to have each individual student make their own assignment with a check done by the teacher. The problem with this is if an individual student is given the choice to make their own assignments many will choose something much easier than necessary and not get the proper education benefits from the assignment. Then, if everything about the assignment must be checked by the teacher anyways it only gives the illusion of choice. In actuality while the students may have different assignments from each otherÂ it is no different from the teacher just giving the students a more specialized assignment seeing as the teacher will make the changes to it they need anyways. Since this is not giving the students the true ability to make their own assignments the power is now in the teacher's hands. Therefore, if students are given true control of their assignments, they will always look for an easy way to increase their grade with the least effort, this is why teachers are given responsibility over the students. If responsibility was removed students wouldn't learn in school and assignments would almost never benefit the students.\n \n In conclusion while there can be an argument for students creating assignments, if the choice must be black or white, the teachers should have the responsibility of creating summer assignments. The reasons being that teachers have more knowledge of a given subject and a deeper understanding of students, while the prevalence of apathy in students harms their case. While in actuality the best choice would be one of compromise in which both students and teachers get choice, the teachers should always have the majority of choice in the assigning of almost all work pertaining to school not just summer assignments, or else there is no purpose of school in the first place.Â",

    Essay:
      "For most students, summer is a time of freedom and relaxation; unless, of course, they're given a teacher-designed summer project. As a young learner, I can tell you truthfully that being assigned a summer project is absolutely heart-wrenching. Imagine enjoying your amazing summer and you realize half way through it that you have a summer project due; and if you're anything like me, you'll still find yourself procrastinating on it as the thick assignment haunts you over your shoulder with every fun summer adventure you experience. Don't get me wrong, summer projects can be extremely helpful; however, the stress that comes with them can be avoided if the assignments were student-designed. That way, the work can be personalized to improve the learners' problem areas and fit into their summer plans.\n \n Students know what they struggled with while school was in session; they were in those classrooms learning it and trying to understand it the best they could all year. Therefore, they have the ability and information to design a summer project that allows them to learn and improve in whatever topic they had trouble with by putting it together in sections. Perhaps their problem areas were small parts of units. For example: \"unit 4, 2.1a\". If that's the case, they could include that portion in the assignment to help them practice. If that's not the case and they simply just didn't understand an entire unit, they could sum up the lesson and include those factors as well. This allows them to learn and practice so they can be the best student they possibly could during break.\n \n As I said before, summer is a time of freedom and relaxation; however, us youngÂ onesÂ have to keep learning or else we'd lose our scholar touch. So, the student-designed summer project could be broken up by months; this is an acceptable way to help learners keep track of their summer work becauseÂ not only does it allow them to set aside free time for their break, it also helps them make a reserved time for assignments. That way, kids can still enjoy their break while keeping those learning juices flowing. This working format mayÂ even help uplift stress because when students see a big project that's nothing but work and no sections, they start to feel under pressure and might even begin to procrastinate. This event has happened to me countless of times; I see the task, get overwhelmed, and procrastinate. Although I am guilty of being a bit of a bad student because of this, I know good and well that sectioning work into months is a much better way to handle the load.\n \n Opponents may claim that because they don't want to work over summer, the young learners will make it ridiculously easy for themselves so they can have a relaxing break. This is a valid point, however, us students just want to improve ourselves. It can be embarrassing to lack understandingÂ of what's going on in the classroom; it can also make students feel like failures, or even feel stupid. I know from personal experience that school leaves majority of the kids feeling like the most idiotic person alive; but that just motivates them to do more to improve so they won't think down on themselves. That is where the student-designing comes into play; if they made it too easy for themselves, they wouldn't be improving. If they're not improving, the continuous cycle of feeling like an idiot will not end.\n \n In conclusion, students know what is needed for them to thrive in their academics and they're willing to have open arms to allow that to happen. With the assignments being by students, for students, they are designed specifically to help them achieve the hardships of assignments and to come back to school with their brains running, in school mode, and ready to learn.Â",

    Essay:
      "Some schools have these dreadful summer projects that students don't really enjoy to do. However, it's required in most schools, regardless if it's a reading assignment or a history assignment. The school system just wants us to keep our brains going during the break. Now here comes the big question of the day, should the projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? When this was first brought to my attention I would have said student-designed .Now that I have put further thought into it . I feel that it should be teacher-designed and student based. What I mean by that is students should have a big role in how teachers design it, so that students would be eager to do them ,and have a good challenge on their hands. Nevertheless it should be fun and educational.\n \n Students count down until summer break and not just in ''\n \n Highschool Musical''\n \n either they can't wait to hangout with their friends, be out all night, and not have to wake up for school. Students know it's always that boring assignment that they have to complete over summer , which they wait the last minute to do. If the assignment was student based which mean it would have been appealing to to them, then they wouldn't wait all summer to do. It wouldn't just be a bunch of confused, nonintrested students putting anything down on a piece of paper just so they can get a grade. Some people might not agree and say an assignment is an assignmentÂ it has to get done regardless. However I myself am a student and I know once students get an assignment that they are eager to do your probably going to get their best work yet.\n \n Everyone loves a good challenge especially a student. I know I do, and so does my peers. Students love an interesting challenge that will have them using their brains. The whole purpose of the summer project is to assure that students learn over the summer. What a better way to do it then by finding out what interest the students and challenge them to lean more about it , rather its for History class or English ,or in the format of a poster board project or an essay project. An educational challenge is always a good challenge because 1 it teaches students not to give up 2 that there is always more to learn.\n \n I understand that theres going to be an assignment due at the beginning of each school year. However, if it is teacher-designed and student based schools will have an outstanding out come because the more the students are eager to learn , the challenges get harder, and the harder it gets .The more students learn how to succeed in life after high schoolÂ probably before they reach high school or the 12th grade for that matter. Summer projects are for the students to learn more an as long as it is teacher designed and student based the school system will have a greaterÂ impact on our lives.",

    Essay:
      "If there's one thing all students can agree on, it's that summer is the best time of the year. We can also agree that having to complete work assigned over the summer is the worst. Instead of staying home and doing a math worksheet for hours, most students would rather be lying on a beach. Summer gives kids the chance to get a break from the stress that comes with school and having to spend free time doing assignments they don't enjoy. Some schools have started implementing projects assigned to students for them to complete over summer break. These can either be teacher-designed or student-designed, which creates controversy. I believe that schools that require summer projects should be student-designed in order to build creative skills, allow students to explore their interests, and experience more responsibility.\n \n A lot of students often feel stuck when it comes to working on school projects with specific guidelines and topics. Instead, these summer projects would let kids be creative in what they'd like to complete it on. It's very important for students to learn how to be creative, which many jobs need in the future. In the past, some of my favorite projects I've done were the ones where I got to have total control on what it was on. It allowed me to use my creativity for something different and helped me strengthen those skills. Students need to learn how to use their creativity to create a project to better prepare themselves for skills needed in different fields of work. Letting students explore their creativity also helps them enjoy completing these summer projects more. I feel that whenever I'm assigned something over the summer, I dread doing it and then end up finishing it at the last minute. If I had more control over a project assigned to me over the summer, I would have a much easier time completing it. Kids don't like to be constantly restricted, so letting them have creative control over a school project would result in better work. By giving students creative freedom over summer projects, they're able to strengthen their creativity and make a better project overall.\n \n For most students, we don't usually get to choose which classes interest us the most until middle school. Student-designed summer projects allows us to explore things we're more interested in than what we learn in school. I've found myself feeling trapped in a class that I absolutely hate, which makes it much harder for me to do well in that class. When I get to use what I'm interested in to create something like a project, it's a lot easier for me to feel motivated to do so. In middle school, we had to make PSA projects for a couple different classes, which allowed us to choose a topic we like. I chose to do one of mine of adopting dogs instead of buying dogs, and I ended up getting an A on it since it was something I was really interested in researching and informing others of. Students want to learn more about topics that aren't taught in school and these student-led projects will let them do just that. Teachers can expected to receive much better work on projects that students are actually interested in, rather than a boring or confusing topic. This can also help student discover new things that they enjoy that they would've never found out about if they hadn't be assigned the project. New discoveries are beneficially to students who struggle with what they enjoy while trying to think about their future. Students enjoy getting to explain some of the things they find interesting in the form of projects.\n \n Many students are faced with responsibility everyday, but if they have to create their own unique project, they get to experience responsibility that isn't always available to them. Students can learn how to be responsible by experiencing it from something they enjoy. A project that they can design is the perfect opportunity to explore responsibility. Doing those PSA projects was helpful for me because I dealt with the responsibility of completing the project better than I had before. I felt that coming up with my PSA wasn't a chore, but rather something I actually enjoyed. These projects can help teach students that responsibility isn't always something that has to be dreaded or feared. Responsibility can help build character and maturity. Student-designed projects allow students to learn that responsibility can be enjoyable too.\n \n The introduction of summer projects in schools should be student-designed so students can be more creative, learn about new things, and learn how to be responsible. Many could argue that letting students create their own projects gives them false hope that most projects will be the same, but they also let kids experience individualism. Teachers would still have to put some restrictions in order to keep them appropriate and give a standard set of guidelines on what the materials should include. Letting students design their own summer projects helps them grow as they get older to help them for their futures. Many teachers should consider assigning fun projects instead of worksheets over the summer in order to get the best results from students.Â",

    Essay:
      "Most students do not like homework over the summer, so it can be difficult to get students to do the work. Many schools just give students a generalized project to keep their brains working. If you got students involved in the choice of their homework, they would be more likely to really work their brains on it. Schools that require projects over the summer should be student designedÂ because it will increase enthusiasm and expand variety, students will go into more detail, and cheating will be decreased.\n \n First, if schools made summer projects student designed, it would increase enthusiasm and expand the variety from the students. For example, Generic_Name who loves outer space is more likely to put effort and research into a project about space than he or she would about the water cycle. Each student has their own interests, and the best way to reach the minds of all students is to let them design their own project. The originality of the students should not be diminished by putting their creative ideas in a box because we want a generalized subject. Teachers also don't want to read the same report over and over 30 times. Student designed projects would allow the grading process to be more interesting for teachers. In the event a student discovered something very interesting, you could actually do something with it.\n \n Also, student designed projects would improve the likelihood of students going into more detail. Students want the opportunity to expand their knowledge in topics that interest them. Why not let them teach themselves and you something along the way? Students doing a project on something that doesn't interest them would be a vague and boring version of something that could be chosen by the student. In the science fair people aren't given a topic, they are told to run free with all the ideas they can think of. That's how a summer project should be.\n \n Finally, student designed projects would decrease the level of cheating. Student designed projects wouldn't allow for the same cheating as teacher designed projects because the ideas would have to come originally from the researcher. You might think student design versus teacher design has nothing to do with cheating, but there are many reasons as to why this is a component. Say you are a big vacationer and choose not to do your project until the end of the summer, you might just call up a friend and ask them to share their ideas with you. With teacher designed projects, that is very easily done. If you chose your project and did all the research on it, you would be less likely to give up all the information to a lazier student.\n \n Schools should have student designed summer projects because enthusiasm and variety increase, there will be more details on the projects, and cheating is less likely to happen. Students want to have fun over their summer with as little stress as possible. Giving students the chance to design their own projects would not only get their brains working but would allow the research to be fun. Turning a task into an exciting opportunity for learning is what would happen if projects were student designed.Â Â",

    Essay:
      "At some schools summer projects are a requirement for students to complete during the break. These projects are assigned for students to continue learning over the summer break. Not only do these projects help students learn new content, but it helps the students retain the information they have learned prior to the break. These breaks are fairly lengthy and without some work between each school year it is often difficult to retain the information that the students have learned. Many of these projects are teacher-designed, and the thought of student-designed projects are a possibility. Student-designed projects may sound great to students, but this would ultimately be ineffective when it comes to student progression. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would be more organized, more effective, and more efficient.\n \n Although some may say that student-designed projects would lead to less stress, teacher-designed projects take away the stress of creating the project. Students will have to think and create a project for themselves to do over the summer with student-designed projects. This adds another step for the students to go through in order to complete their work. Some students are not as creative as others, and they might struggle to think of an idea for their project. Some students may stress over if what they completed is acceptable and adequate. Students would not have to stress over the creation of their projects if they were just given guidelines to follow by their teachers. Teachers distress the projects by taking away tasks that the students would need to complete to finish their assignments. Students having to create their projects adds a whole level of stress to the project that would not be there if the teachers had designed the projects for the students.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would be more organized than student-designed projects. Teachers can create organized projects with many details to the project due to them already doing that during the school year. Teachers create projects and assignments throughoutÂ the school year, so they are good at creating guidelines and rubrics on which they are scored upon. Teachers are able to organized the fine details of the project such as what it is on, what it should be formatted like, and what it will graded on. Teachers can organize assignments better than students because it is their jobs to do so in order for students to learn. Teachers are the best suited in order to make projects organized.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would be more effective than student designed projects. The projects created by teachers are based on material that the students have learned or will learn in the future. Students should not know the material that they will learn in the future, so the teachers creating the material for the students would be effective for them to learn. The teachers know the content the students will learn, so making the students create the assignments would be absurd. Teachers know how to create projects that will help students understand the material because they know how students learn. Giving students the task of creating a project will be based on prior knowledge and not what they will learn: this is just memory retention rather than learning.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would be more efficient than student-designed. Students creating a project for themselves to do will take up more time than if the teacher were to assign an project for the majority of students. This takes away the time from the students' vacations and time to create the project. The teachers would make the experience much less time consuming for both the students and the teacher. The students would spend less time designing the project, and the teachers would spend less time going through each project idea. Teachers would efficiently grading through the projects due to them being based on the same assignment.\n \n Teachers would be the best option to design projects for the students to do over summer break. Teachers would create a less stressful project overall for the students because they would have to spend less time on creating an idea for the project. The teachers are better at organizing big assignments and projects such as a summer project. Teachers know the material that students will learn making teacher-designed projects more effective for student learning. Teachers will create a time effective and efficient projects not only to complete, but to grade as well. Teacher-designed projects are more beneficial to the student for learning over the break than student-designed projects and should be the preferred method of project design for all schools that require summer projects.",

      "As the weather becomes warmer at the end of June, students eagerly leave their schools excited for the start of summer. However, in most school districts, summer break doesn't mean a break from school work. Many school districts require students to complete an assignment over the summer to assure they continue learning . Over the three month break, students must complete one project. This project should be about a topic of their choosing. Allowing students to complete a project on an area of their interest, rather than a topic assigned by the teacher, the work will be of higher quality, have a stronger impact on students learning, and be more enjoyable for both the teacher and students involved.\n \n When students complete a project on what interests them the most, the quality of their work is dramatically increased. The students are willing to do more research on a topic they enjoy than a topic assigned to them. Someone who spends time playing music outside of school will be more interested in discovering the impact of music on their community, than researching the rain patterns in the state of Florida. Over time, the work each individual puts into their project will be more meaningful and have a stronger impact on their learning. A student may go out to a museum related to their topic, or interview a neighbor that is specialized in a specific area. The knowledge gained from students completing their project is important, but each student will learn new skills beneficial to their unique life in the future. When school rolls back around again in August, each student will have a more enjoyable time sharing to their classmates and teachers about the topic they spent time lots of time learning more about over the break.\n \n Some people may argue that all students should complete the same exact teacher-designed project over the summer. While doing so may make it easier for teachers to grade by simply using a rubric and checking off all areas complete and marking off areas not included. However, when the school year begins, most people involved won't be interested. Classmates listening to the project will not be focused on the student presenting, since they also completed the same project, and the teachers grading will quickly get bored from hearing the same thing over and over again. The entire objective of having an assignment for students to complete over the summer, is to ensure they are still learning. If students aren't interested in the topic they are working on, the impact of the project and knowledge acquired will not be as great. The impact will be much greater if students are completing a project on something they enjoy.\n \n Allowing students to have a more enjoyable summer that is still filled with learning is important. Students that are required to complete a project over the summer should be researchingÂ about a topic they enjoy, rather than one assigned by a teacher. When students complete work that is important to them, the final product will be of much higher quality, have a stronger impact on the students learning and future, and be more enjoyable for the teacher and all students involved.

      "BOO! BOO! Cried the Generic_SchoolÂ students when they found out they have to complete a summer project over break in order to assure they do not forget all of the material they have learned over the school year. However, what these students do not know is that they are not the only students that have to complete this project. Various schools have adopted this strategy and there has been a debate about whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Letting students design their summer projects could be an extravagant opportunity because students would have an opportunity to be creative, however, teachers should be in charge of the summer projects because teachers have more knowledge on their subject than the students, more experience with lesson planning, and can also construct projects that can be fun and enjoyable for students.\n \n To start off, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more knowledge about their subject than students. For example, by the end of the school year many students have already forgot most of what they have learned over the past school year. On the other hand, teachers teach their subject material over and over again for years at a time. Teachers know their subject like the back of their hands, where as, students are just learning this material and still have much more to learn. Another reason would be that students often have a hard time remembering the material they learned at the beginning of the school year because students have work upon work piled onto them with every class that they take. Once the students learn one unit teachers move onto a different unit and eventually by the end of the year students have so much information crammed into their brains that they can have a hard time keeping up. This is why teachers should take it upon themselves to plan the summer projects for students.\n \n Additionally, teachers have more experience with lesson planning. The job of a teacher is to come up with different lesson plans and strategies for their students to assure they obtain all the information they need. Students are not educated on how to teach other students. Students may be able to come up with a summer project but between the students and the teachers the teachers would have a better project idea because that is their job to have effective projects. Teachers know what strategies work for helping students obtain knowledge. It would be irresponsible to allow students to come up with their own project. Any typical student would not be thrilled about the idea of having a summer project so if students were given the opportunity to construct their own assignment then they would make it to where they would not have to do as much work. However, teachers would guarantee that their project plan would work for their students.\n \n Furthermore, teachers have the ability to construct projects that are fun and enjoyable for students. Although there may be a selective group of teachers who typically would not have hands on and enjoyable projects, majority of teachers could construct a fun summer project for students. Whether the project is to visit a certain historical figure and take notes or to raise awareness for any person in need. Some teachers who are experienced and have worked with students for years at a time are aware of what students are capable of. If a student is motivated enough and has the right resources then they can achieve any project assigned to them. Teachers would also have to keep in mind that every students is different and has different resources and limits.\n \n To conclude, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers are more knowledgeable than students about their subject, they have effective lesson planning strategies for students, and have the ability to make any project enjoyable for students. There is nothing wrong with assigning students summer projects to make sure that students remember all the material of the past year. Students forgetting material over a set amount of time is not uncommon. As long as these summer projects are fun and not stressful on students then the students will remember their summer for years to come.Â",

      "Summer is a great time of year for both teachers and students. Months of break and leisure allow for a good cool downÂ after a long school year. However, summer isn't all fun and games, as many schools give out summer assignments in order to keep the students learning over break. But should the responsibility of designing these projects fall on the student or the teacher? I believe that teachers should create and design these projects, as students could make the assignment too easy or too hard, warp the directions to a point where the final product is no longer what the teacher is looking for, or just not complete it.\n \n My first reason justifyingÂ my belief is that students could make the assignment too easy or too hard. If given the choice between taking on a difficult assignment and an easy one, most students would choose the easy one. In this same way, if students are given the opportunity to make their own assignment, then they will do everything in their power to make sure it's as simple and easy as possible. This results in them not actually learning anything and defeats the whole purpose of the assignment in the first place. On the other side of the spectrum, there could be students who try to take on too much with their project, setting lofty goals and overcomplicatingÂ the assignment. This only serves to build stress the student over break as then they feel as if their project is too much to complete and only do a minimal amount of work on it, if any at all. If a teacher were to give set directions, then this wouldn't happen as there would be a very minimal amount of freedom, resulting in projects being neither too easy or too difficult.\n \n Furthermore, if a student is given the reigns on the creation of an assignment, they could warp the directions, intentionally or accidentally, and the project could end up becoming something the teacher isnt looking for. This could happen for many reasons, ranging from students with malcontentÂ looking to make it easier for themselves or students who just understood the directions differently than the teacher explained them, resulting in a project that doesn't teach the student what they need to learn. If this occurs, the student would not realize their mistake until they go back to school in the fall and turn in their assignment for a grade, leaving them with a bad grade to start off the year and no chance for remediation.\n \n However, the opportunity to create and design the assignment could help students find motivation and may even affect the quality of the work. It's no secret that people do better work when they are invested in the topic or field, and often times go out of their way to avoid topics they hate. Because of this, if students are given the freedom to create their own project, they are more likely to center it around something they are passionate about, leading them to be more likely to not only complete the assignment over break but actually put effort into it.\n \n Contrary to the previous point, students, if left to their own devices, could end up just not doing the assignment. This could happen because the vague guidelines given by the teacher to design an an assignment could be unclear and seem overwhelming to even begin. Non-creative students could also not to start the project as they can't think of a place to start, leaving them to be more likely to not try. Even if the student does get over the initial barrier of creating an assignment, they could get bored wit their topic and change it several times, resulting lack of motivation to actually finish or a final product that is half baked or an amalgamation of several ideas.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects need to be created and designed by teachers in order to prevent students from making and assignment too easy or too hard, warping the directions, or not doing the assignment at all. All of these only result in the students getting nothing out of their summer assignments, leaving precious break time wasted.",

      "Summers can be the best times of a students life. They get a break from the stress and anxiety of school and they are allowed to do any and all things they wish to do within the legal limits. Summer projects are designed to keep students engaged and learning. This can be a very good thing as long as the project is based on a topic that the student actually enjoys and will be motivated to complete. Students struggle staying engaged enough during the school year, adding a project during the time they are meant to go be kids should be handled very carefully. If they want the projects to be successful they must set a broad topic and allow the students to chose anything they want under that umbrella topic. Students will enjoy doing a project about a certain YouTube creator they have fun watching, a sports team they love, or even their favorite book they read during school or over summer break. These projects should not be based around a Shakespeare play that they struggle to even read let alone comprehend. Summer projects are a good idea as long as they are handled well.\n \n Assigning a project to a kid during the two and a half month break they get is something that needs to be handled very carefully. Learning is very important and having the project is a good idea. The students must be able to choose exactly what they want to do. This will keep them interested in the project which will make all the grades of the projects go up compared to if it was a topic they have no interest in. The students will use more of their time to perfect the project instead of waiting until the last weekend and just turning it in because they do not care about the topic and do not want to waste their time on something that has no impact on their future as soon as they finish the next test they have on the topic. Allowing the students to pick and choose their topic will help them learn about their team, person, idea, etc. without making them feel the stress and anxiety of a teacher assigned school project.\n \n Projects picked by a student may even result in more knowledge being gained than a teacher assigned project. Students could focus on a sports team and how they network their team to different audiences in different ways. For example, mascots are normally focused on the younger audience. Teams almost always have a promotion for the first certain number of people that arrive. The first one thousand people to go through the security gates get a free t-shirt or the first fifty fans to arrive get a jersey. Marketing and understanding how to focus products to a certain group of people is so important. My dream school, Virginia Tech, has promotions every basketball game that if the opposing team misses two free throws in a row the entire crowd gets a voucher for free bacon. This encourages all Hokie fans to be as loud as possible to mess with the mental mindset of the opposing teams shooter. A majority of jobs and careers that are pursued must have a way of marketing or selling their product so this is a very important skill for kids to have that they would not other wise be able to understand if they had to read a Shakespeare book followed by a five pager paper.\n \n Having a teacher assigned project does have an upside. This will give the students structure and something to base their project on instead of having all the options in the world and not being able to choose one. In school, students are normally more prepared if it is a topic they have been learning about and have background knowledge on compared to a project half way through a topic, or even towards the beginning. If students are given a short book or even a PowerPoint on the topic at hand they will be more successful in completing their project.\n \n A student lead project during the summer is a great thing it keeps the mind or a student engaged with out boring them. Students can research any and all topics they would like so that they enjoy keeping their brain working and focused on bettering themselves. Teacher based projects will give the students structure but will leave them feeling not engagedÂ because the topic is not something they will necessarily enjoy. The idea of a student based project is a good idea and should be created to help the minds and bodies of the students.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Although in theory a student-designed project sound good, in practice the students will most likely struggle to make the project because of lack of understanding the project. This is why a teacher-designed project would be beneficial because it would be more thought out, leave a clear outline of what to do in the project and have more structure then say a student designed project.\n \n When you're a teenager you want to be free as possible but sometimes you are too free, that you don't know what to do with this much freedom so you do nothing.\n \n In this sense the project that would be designed by a student most student would have no idea where to start discouraging them for even commencing the project and of course there will be people that can do the project easily but we want to make the project fair and equal for everybody.\n \n This is why a teacher-designed project would be best because it would leave a outline of what the project is about, What you will create, how you will do it and what criteria you have to meet to have your project pass leaving it fair and equal for everybody or another solution to this problem is that it could be the students choice if he/she want to design the project or take the teacher-design project\n \n In conclusion a teacher-designed project would be the best option for this summer project because it would let the teacher outline certain thing they want in the project to ensure that the students are still learning over the summer break.",

    Essay:
      "Over the summer students tend to forget a vast amount of valuable information they learn during their education. To fix that issue most schools assign summer projects to students every year. These projects assure that students retain the information they learned in school and possibly learn more over the long three month break. In most cases, these projects are teacher-designed and students have no part in the creation of them. Some students may want to design the summer project; however, it should stay as the teachers responsibility. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge and teachers know how to creating projects.\n \n To begin, summer projects should be created by teachers because of how much information they know. In order to teach students, it is common knowledge that an educator has to know more than the learners. The summer project is meant to not only help students retain information, but also to learn more, and teachers are easily capable of adding that needed information. If there is a greater amount of information on the project, then students will be able to remember what they have learned. An example of such a project would be The Summer Reading Project because of how much material is sprawled into it. The Summer Reading Project is when students read a book over the summer and are required to fill out a paper with details of the book. This project reminds students of what they learned in English class and also helps students learn more by reading new books. This well thought out project is teacher-designed; therefore, teachers are more capable of creating summer projects than students because they have more knowledge. Either way, teachers having been learning how to teach most of their life should know best on how to create summer projects.\n \n To elaborate, teachers should design summer projects because they know how to create projects better than any student. Teachers learn how to teach and create projects for their students before they can even start educating them. This means that most teachers have experience with creating projects already and that making a summer project would be an easy task. Students have no background in creating projects because they are always the ones who complete them. Therefore, students creating their own projects would most likely end up as a disaster. A scenario like this would be chaos because students rely on teachers to give them the information required to learn, and they can not get that material if they are the ones creating the project. Teachers know how to make projects, so they should be in charge of the construction of summer projects.\n \n On the other hand, some people do believe student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial. This is because it could teach a student how to be responsible or learn on their own. However, many students today are extreme procrastinators and because of that their work would likely be average or below average. Teacher-designed projects are better because there would be a system that students can use to understand information better. If students were in charge it would become a jumbled messy puzzle of a project.\n \n To end, summer projects are better off being created by teachers because teachers are more knowledgeable and know how to create projects better than any student. Teacher-designed summer projects are extremely beneficial for students. New information learned from these projects provided by teachers can help students be prepared for what comes the next year. It is important to have a system in projects and the best people to create that system in the summer projects are teachers.",

      "The student-designed projects will create an educational and more engaging summer program than teacher-designed projects. Summer projects that are student designed will allow the students to create an engaging project that they will want and be able to complete over the summer break. By allowing students to design the summer project, students will want to complete the lessons they have created and will be able to follow the lessons at their own pace, with teacher assistance if they get stuck or have trouble completing the project.\n \n With the ability to create a structured summer project students will be engaged in the project and it will allow them to express their own creativity while designing the project. While creating the projects the students should be given a rough outline of the themes and main points that should be covered in the project, this will allow the students to complete a projects that will follow along with the lessons that teachers will present during the school year. Book projects that are student-designed and assigned over break would be interesting and engaging for students who may or may not find the actual book interesting, this would encourage the students to complete the project before the school year starts and be less stressful for the students. This process would lessen student stress about summer school work and would prepare the students for their classes in the new school year.\n \n The projects that the students create would also allow the students to follow along at their own pace throughout the summer without having to worry about family vacations or other activities because they would already understand the project and know what is required and how to complete it. This would also encourage the students to complete the project because it would be something they created themselves. The student projects that are created could have check-ins every few weeks to remind students of the project and ensure that they are gradually completing the assignment. This would allow the teachers some control over the programs without undermining the student-designed aspect of the project.\n \n A drawback to the student-designed aspect of these summer projects would be the concern about the educational value of the projects that are student design. The students could create a project that does not incorporate analysis or thinking skills that are necessary for their course during the school year. These concerns would be solved with teacher guidelines for the the project with certain requirements that would use the analysis and thinking skills, without taking away from the aspect of the student creation. This would allow the students to create an educational program that is interesting to students and meets all the required thinking and analysis skills.\n \n By allowing students to create their own projects the school system is continuing the students education over the summer break while still enabling students the freedom to do the school work at their own pace and have engaging projects for the students to complete. This program will increase the student learning throughout the summer and prepare them for the upcoming classes in the next school year.Â",

    Essay:
      "Everytime students hear the word school they all have a similar reaction: \"why school.\" This reaction is due to the rigor of work school puts on students' backs and the repetition of constant learning. In order to give students time away, they are given three months of summer break which spans from June - August. During this time many kids choose not to continue learning and a negative effect of this is knowledge and memory decay. In order for their minds to be stimulized and conditioned to learn once school begins, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. The summer projects should be designed specifically by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them and express their ideas without being limited by a teacher, on the other hand teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them. Being able to do something which one is passionate about results in the best work that he/she can produce, this is because learning is driven by motivation. When a teacher assigns something for the student to do, he/she does not have an eagerness to learn because of the fact that it is something they don't have a strong passion for. When students are given an opportunity to produce their own projects, their minds open up and they begin to think outside of the box, which results in true creativity. School is based on a set curriculum and students have no input on what they learn and how they learn it, as a result, students lack effort and motivation to learn. Giving students an opportunity to create will eventually lead to increased productivity in later life One example of this is when adulthood hits and students are required to develop a skill set. Students are never given the opportunity to learn individually and this causes students to become dependent on others to feed them knowledge and information, therefore, students will only learn when they are demanded to. Having the freedom to create will give students their best opportunity to learn, whereas when they are not able to design certain projects, their goal shifts from learning to completing which will result in the content not actually being analyzed and took in.\n \n Not only does students designing their own projects give them a opportunity to pursue their interest, but it also gives them ability to express their ideas in a fashion which they are not pressured and limited by others. Students become boxed in boundaries due to the pressure of doing things a certain way and learning the way teachers tell them to. When students can design projects and learn in a way they believe is beneficial, learning becomes less of pressured task and more of a way to explore one's horizon. One thing students struggle with the most when completing assignments and projects is constant pressure. Students do not have the ability to express their ideas because they have to stick to an exact rubric. One of example of this is a science expo; many teachers tell the students what they should do for the project and don't give the students time to think about what interests them. This pressure of another voice constantly in their head makes learning and expression of ideas a struggle. In order for students to reach their full potential, they should be able to design in a way they are not boxed by others.\n \n In contrast to student-designed projects, teacher designed projects also have a positive impact on students because of their ability to create content which is consistent with the content students learn during the school year. Thinking outside the box and being able to express ideas is very important, however, without teachers, students would have no path of what to learn and how to learn it because they do not have the experience and accumulated knowledge many teachers have. Teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to the students ability to learn during the summer because the content would be structured in way which is taught during the school year. An example of this is when a science teacher assigns a cell packet project which corresponds to the cell unit taught during school. This might be very boring for a student to learn, but doing this project will set the student up for success when school begins. If the student were to design their own project it would probably not be in line with the certain style of teaching which will cause the student to struggle during the school year. The main focus of teachers is to help students succeed in school and by designing these projects students will be able on the correct path to fulfilling that goal.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to learn in a way which interests them and express their ideas without limitations and pressure by a teacher, on the other hand, teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. Being able to acquire knowledge and learn in way which interests one self is very important throughout his/her life, however there are different goals for both the student and a teacher. The teacher's goal is to help the student succeed in a certain class, whereas the students goal is to learn what they want in a way which interests them. Having the right balance is very important and this balance can be obtained by students designing their own projects in the summer and teachers guiding students during the school year. This method will result in individuality development and the teachers can lead the students on the right path throughout the school year.Â",

    Essay:
      "Every year from 6th grade to 12th grade year students have to do a summer project and turn it in to their teachers in their next upcoming school year. Due to al the mixed feelings about the project there's been a debate about whether it should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers will ensure the student will learn and grow and they'll set the proper criterias for it.\n \n Teachers know what students need to learn and usually what they will be learning in their next school year. With this knowledge teachers can determine how the projects should be structured to help benifit the students and make them grow. For example a summer reading project, a project made by a teacher where the students have to choose a book that's on the reading level that they should be at and do a report on it. The way this project is structured helps students learn and grow by keeping them reading making them grow stronger in it which can help them in the future with work,writing,etc.\n \n If somebody wants to learn something they need certain criterias to help them actually learn. A person can't learn something from something they already learned and know. The same thing can be applied to summer projects a student can't learn something new from something easy and that they already know. They need certain criterias, restrictions, rules on stuff to ensure they will learn. Teachers can ensure that the students will grow and continue on learning by putting the correct criterias. For example the summer reading project again where students have to choose a book in their reading level and do a report. If the teacher didn't put the rule of choosing a book in their reading level a student could have chose a very easy book and not really learn anything from it because it's not challenging for the student and something too easy to learn from. Therefor having teachers designing the projects ensures they will put the right rules down to make sure the students is learning. Not all students will do something like that but having a teacher makes it easier and more trusting to know they will keep learning over the summer.\n \n Some people think students should design it because it would be a lot more funner for them, get them more engaged, and make them a lot more enthusiastic about it when given the chance to design it. It's good to have the students enthusiastic and engaged but it's not ensured whether they will learn something or not. The chance of a student designing a project that won't help them learn much is not beneficial and defeats the purpose of the summer projects. It's a teachers's job to make sure that students are learning so they will do their job and make sure they are. It's better to know for sure the students will learn with the teachers designing it rather than to not be sure with the students designing it.\n \n Teachers are way more educated that students are. So they can make the best projects that can benefit the students the most compared to the students designing it. They know what to do, what to look for, and what's best for school. They are more trained,equiped, and have more knowledge to do it. So teachers should be designing summer projects not students.",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during there break. I think that they should be student-designed because if the schools want the students to do work on there summer break then it should be something they want to learn. Some people might think that they should be designed by teachers to maximize the stuff they can learn. Also If the students design the projects they will have more fun doing them because its something they chose.\n \n I think that if students design there own summer projects they are something they want to do and not what the teachers want them to do. For example if a teacher designs the project then It would be like another day of school and i dont think the students want to do school during there summer break. They would prefer relaxing and not having to do work for 3 months. Also if the students design it then it will be something they like to do. For example having games or something similar to help them learn. Also if its something the students designed and wanted to do It would be more likely to get done and It wouldntÂ be a waste of time.\n \n Another example why students should assign there own summer projects is that it would be more fun. For example like including math in one of there games. Or having a coloring sheet that helps them with addition or subtraction. Another reason why students should design there own projects is that they would most likely get it done because there having fun with it.\n \n Other people might say that teachers should design the projects because it would maximize the amount of stuff included. For example a student might include easy subjects in there project but teachers could put everything they learned and put it in one project. also if students design it they might get stuff wrong if they dont know it.\n \n In conclusion students should design their own projects because if schools want students to do work on their summer break then t should be something they want to do. Also it should be something fun that they'll want to do and finally some people might say that teachers should design the projects to maximize the amt of stuff included.",

    Essay:
      "During the summer for most people its the time to go have fun , go out in the sun , go on vacation, work , babysit, or do whatever you want to do .In multiple societies for one-hundred eighty days students attend school and usually most high school students end up working or participating in some kind of sport during this time period . Due to this time lineÂ being so hectic with the pressure of studying and commitments within and outside of school its best that students now have this time during the summer to just be kids, be creative , be themselves , learn themselves, and take advantage of this break to the fullest extent. Because some schools require students to complete a summer project the assignment should be student-designed so they can be creative in their own individual ways and reflect growth over time.\n \n Even though teachers are use to giving students direct instructions on their work , it is fundamental to the development of the child to learn individuality. Giving students the choice to express themselves through the work they turn into their teachers at the end of the summer will show you who that person is through their behavior. For example, one day i came into class and my teacher had been telling us for weeks that we were going to have a project to do with no guidlines ... to just be creative and express ourselves into whatever form. She said it doesnt matter what it is it just has to be presentable. I could not figure it out for the life of me what i was going to do, i panicked because it was for my english class my best subject. Then i realized one of the largest issues we deal with as a whole in society today is individuality , who are we. So many people struggle with individuality especially in school systems because everything isÂ mimicked or put in place to follow a direct pathway that is made for students to be like someone else. Which is why that very simple question \"who am i\" ate at me for days until i sat down and really thought about it and i ended up writting a poem . I hadnt realized how much i use to enjoy writting them until i started thinking about something that really stimulated my mind and asked me a question i could contemplate. In the end i got an A in all areas of the summative but the grade didnt matter to me. I learned something that meant something to me that'll carry on into my adulthood. It mattered that one of my favorite english teachers taught me to be creative and unlocked different passions within myself just by giving me an assignment with no guidelines teaching me to teach myself personal growth. Giving students a chance to express themselves in their own ways teach them that its okay to be themselves , its ok to not be perfect , its okay to not know things because your still learning which is one of the best things you can do as a tecaher .\n \n After learning individuality it is important to reflect upon the growth , this will help teachers understand the students as a person overtime. Although if this assignment were teacher-designed the summer poject could just be another way for students to just feel trapped , overwhelmed, or irritated because they feel as if their teacher is giving them pointless busy work during a time their supposed to be having fun. Its better to give them work that means something , work that teachers can study , so they can feel like as a teacher your just as invested in them as they have to be into you. There was a very obvious difference between my english teachers assignments and my science teachers assignments , one of them stimulated my mind with questions about the world that my teacher left up to me to express and talk about and the other left me bored and uninterested and asking for help on bookwork . One of my teachers invested in learning about me for who i am as a person so she could teach me to the best of her capability and the other could care less for who i was as a person. My grades also became a representation of that ; Its understandable that duing the school year theres not alot of time to get to know 100+ students but over the summer dont make students do work for no reason , make it meaningful and make it worth something .\n \n In conclusion because some schools require students to complete a summer project the assignment should be student-designed so they can be creative in their own individual ways and reflect growth over time. School is a large part of the development of all people , it is how you learn and who your taught by for hours at a time . Over the summer these projects give students a way to get rewarded by grades comming back into school by showing who they are as a person. School systems should influence students more by showing that they're invested in them and not just on the grades they make in classes but who they are as a person teaching more than just book smarts but life experiences that they can bring into their adulthood.",

From first grade to twelfth grade, every student in United States is eligible to get free education in public schools. Growing healthy minded generations is very important for the U.S, because everyone knows that today's kids will become future's heroes, unless they get the right education. Since Declaration of Independence, United States government is trying to perfect its education system. In today's system, students have to go to school five days of the week and nine months. Most of the schools starts on August or September and ends on June. After June, students have three months of break. Through three month break, some schools require students to complete summer projects to ensure they continue learning during their break. At that time, students think those projects are just wasting their time through the summer break but what they don't realize is those projects are helping them to become goal-directed and resilient individuals. In some schools teachers select the project topic for their students but some teachers prefer to give options to their students,Â because they believe by doing that students' creativity can improve over the summer break. Although some teachers believe giving the same option for the summer project is saving their students from being sucked at two undecided topics, teachers also believe students should be free to choose their topic so they can beÂ creative to do their projects.\n \n During the summer break, every student wants to be way from any kind of school work and have fun. Most of the students doesn't like the conceptÂ of summer project because they think it is going to waste their time. For now, it might seem like that but when they grow they realize that all of these summer projects helped them to become a better citizen. According to an university research, 65% of the students, who don't have summer projects to do, forget what they learned from previous year. Summer projects don't just help students to go forward on their education journey but they also help to improve students' creativity and critical thinking skills. All of these can be possible, if students are able to choose their project topic. Students, especially kids who go to elementary school, gets very excited if they can choose their topic. They actually use their brains and make researches to come out with an idea. They ask to their parents, friends, even neighbors to get some help (by doing that they also use their communication skills). They make plans, drawings, and more to build their projects. They have fun by learning new things. However, if the teachers forces their student to work on the exactly the same topic, students will just jump from all of these important steps to building their projects. If they do the exact same thing, there won't be any creativity, excitement and critical thinking. Students will get bored and be discussed from school. The only way to show kids school is exciting place to learn new things is letting them to do what ever they want and to come out with new and unique project ideas.\n \n Teachers put their students in the box that they won't be able to come out. This box will limit every students potential to become a star. Kids are like trees. When they are young, you can give the pathway that they can go. However, as they get older, it gets more hard to shape their pathway. It on teacher's hand to choose that pathway. They can be the creator of future leaders or simple unethical people. The person who can only open that box is teachers. Teachers should led their kids to do whatever they want so they can use and improve their skills to be successful. Teachers can't do everything for their students, sometimes they need to push their students' potentials to raise a better generation of U.S. citizens.Â",

      "Students should design the projects that they have to do over summer break not the teachers. If they are designed by the students than they are more likely to make the projects high quality.Â All school year the teachers create and assign the work so the students should get a chance to create there own work to give the teachers a break. This would be a great oppurtunity for students to learn about something that they are specifically interested in. Students should be the ones designing there summer projects.\n \n When people have an input on what is happening that gives them a bigger sense of excitment for the task. If a person is excited for something than they are going to want to do well on whatever it is. In order to create someÂ excitment for a summer project the students should get to use there creativity to design there very own. There is no reason a teacher would want a student to perform poorly on any assignment. By allowing the students to use there creativity to design there own project is a great way to optimize success on these summer projects.\n \n All school year the teachers are the ones who decide what the assignments will be and how they are going to be done. The students then have to conform to the teachers requests and do the assignments how the teacher expects them to be done. Now the students are going into summer break and have to do more school work. They should get a say in what is being done because they really havent gotten that oppurtunity during the school year. This would also be a great way for teachers to get new ideas for future assignmentsÂ as well. The students would now get more freedom on what they can do and the teachers can pick up some new ideas for future lessons when school returns. This could really improve teachers lessons and be a great way to grab students attention.\n \n These projects are assigned over summer break to make sure students continue to learn even on a long beak from school. Students would learn more if they got to choose what the project was, based on there interests on specific topics. Even if the topic isnt something thats needed for school students are continuingÂ to sharpen the way they process things when learning which will help them in school. Due to them getting to put there effort into potentaly learning more about something not specifically addressed in school before. This could help some students in the future when deciding what there major will be while attending college.\n \n Allowing students to design there own summer projects will create good oppurtunities for both students and teachers. Students will be more likely to do well on a project they got to design. Teachers would get a break from having to come up with an assignment. This will create a great oppurtinity for students to expand there knowledge on something that they are truly interested in. If there is going to be a summer project having them be student designed is a fantastic idea.",

      "Summer projects should beÂ design by teachers and not students\n \n Summer of 2016,the teacher assigned a project to read 5 books over the summer break. As a 6th grader the project seemed impossible to accomplish,but, by the end of the summer,the project was completed. 5 books read and a poster summarizing each book. Through out that same year and the following,reading played an important role in my life. Even though sometimes teachers design projects that may be challenging for a student,teachers know what is best for the students;students may not always know what is best for their learning.\n \n A summer project designed by the students has to be chosen before the end of the school year. The problem is that not all students have the same interests,or the materials needed for various projects. Some students might want to do research,not knowing that others may not have access to internet,a computer or the library. When students design their own projects,they are mostly thinking on a way that will benefit them to get the project done and not thinking about what other students will need. This could affect the students that may not get the project finished do to lack of resources.\n \n If a summer project is designed by the students, they might design a project easy enough to finish in the first 2 weeks,so that they can enjoy the rest of the summer. Students might design a project that does not go in depth. they could also design a project that will not necessarily have to do with what was learn over the school year, moreover,students will not challenge themselves to learn when building their own project. A project that does not challenge the students will never help them learn. The purpose of a summer project is so that students learn over the break.\n \n During the school year,teachers design the projects for the students. Teachers know their students,they know what each is capable of and what areas they need to work on. When a teacher designs a project,the project is chosen carefully. The projects designed by teachers will always challenge students to achieve beyond students expectations to reach their best potential. Teachers will never assign a project that is not in the students abilities.\n \n The student's learning is always in the teachers mind when assigning a project.\n \n In conclusion,some schools require students to complete a summer project that should be design by the teacher. When students design projects,the project will not always be in all the students abilities. Teachers design projects so that every student is capable to work on the project and finish it. During summer brake,students do not want to think about school;therefore,the projects designed by the students might not challenge them and help them learn over the break. Teachers know what is best for the students and they should design the summer projects,so that students can learn and grow even when out of the school.",

    Essay:
      "should students or should teachers design their summer homework? I had a really hard time chosing between these two since i can see why having kids design their own homework could be a bad thing but it could also be a good thing. I had it the same way about having teachers createing the homework, is it really the best choice? i don't know. I ended up, after thinking a lot about it, to think that kids would be the best option to create their summer homework.\n \n These kids are expected to some time over the next 6 weeks to choose boring homework over their frinds, goodweather, pooltime, and other fun activities. What do you think that would end up in? them doing a little bit everyday or them doing it all a couple days before school starts and ruin the whole point of it? I think the later, but how do you change that? if they were part of designing the homework they would be able to make it more fun for themself and their friends and therefore be more motivated to do it more often than the last couple days of their summerbreak. If you want kids to do it more often than once every two weeks they need to be self-diciplined which creating the homework can teach them. They would have to be diciplined enough to not just choose the easiest way out but the most productive way out. Having them try and create homework for their summerbreak may start a chain reaction and make them more diciplined in doing their homework for the rest of the year since they got to experience the work and effort that is put into making their homework.\n \n Some kids need their \" aha so that is why I'm learning this subject \" experience, which is pretty important because it helps them reply a subject to the real world which help them learn future things in that subject easier. I belive that having them help design their summer projects would help with that. I know personally that I never had it that way in woodwork, art, music or fysics/chemistry and I do belive I could have been so much better at it if I have my aha experience. I had that experience with english pretty quickly and look at me now a foreign exchange student writting a english sol. Another experience they need is the \" this is actuallt pretty fun/interesting \" experince. This experience is when you find yourself fasinated or having fun with school because you like what you are learning about. I had it that way with social studies and history which is the only reason I have a 108/100 in my history class this quater. Having them design the project would mean that they have the power to make it fun which gives them the power to make the class fun so they can have good grades and interesting conventations about what they are learning. These experiences could also help them figure out what they want to do when they get older, which is pretty important.\n \n Despite seeing all these reasons why kids should make their own homework, I can also see why they shouldn't. I could easily imagine that a kid would take the level down so they wouldn't learn anything from it since they only know what they know and not what they don't know. I don't belive that kids and teachers ever is going to come to an agreement over the amount of homework. I also could imagine that a child would take the lowest work amount possible, which in my eyes don't sound like the purpose if summer projects. Where is their brain in this? having a fun summerbreak with their friends and family or keeping up with their learning? I don't think many children think far enough to keep up with their education when it comes to summerbreak.\n \n in conclution I have decided that a student designed project would be the best way to go around summer projects/homework. I think that students should be able to choose what their project should be about, but I don't think they should have control on amount or level. I do belive that the benefits of having them design the projects overweights the the negative consequences of it. I also think that them learning how to be responsible and desiplined enough to make the project and actually getting them done could have massive benefits for them in the future. So why should teachers design summer projects when the student created ones have so many more benefit and is more effective?",

Students will have fun with these projects and they'll have fun creating them. Here is why it think it should be student designed.\n \n Students have a wide sense of imagination and giving them an opportunity to do something like this is a great way of showing it. These projects give teachers the chance to see students be creative while still learning how to do things. Students love doing projects it gives them the chance to be interactive and it helps them make new friends. Projects lets students and teachers try something new. Students will have a lotÂ of fun making these projects and so will teachers. Every opportunity Students and teachers get to do a project they have fun, so why not let students try to make their own projects to see if its something that can happen every now and then.\n \n These projects will give teachers the opportunityÂ to see how much the students have learned over the course of the school year. For example, lets say the projects is on the renaissance students get to show what they learned during that portion of the year. Students will make a the work fun and maybe even the teachers will have fun with the projects too. Projects are already a lot of fun but students making their own projects will be a great thing for students and teachers. Teachers and students will get a chance to socialize and learn something new. Teachers won't let students show their creativity.\n \n To summarize, I think that the projects should be student made. It gives a chance for growth and development for the students. Students will have a huge opportunityÂ to show what they've learnedÂ during the school year. Seeing students do this really does show how much they've developed the past school year. So therefore it should be student made and not teacher made because some teachers aren't fun.",

    Essay:
      "Projects, a word that some people enjoy and others despise. Over the summer some students are required to do a project to help them learn over their break. However, most of the time the teacher is the one to design the project, but I believe that it is best for the student to design the project. If the student is allowed to design the project they will have some interest in their chosen topic, be able to show their creativity, and will feel less pressured when presenting their work.\n \n When doing a school project it can be really boring, but that is because it is mostly a topic that your teacher chose for you, which will probably be based on what you are currently learning. If the student could choose what they wanted to learn about then they would want to do it more. For example, a teacher asks you to write an essay on a story you just read but didn't enjoy then you will feel like you just want to do the minimum amount of work and not put effort into it, but if it was a story you wanted to talk about then you would go into more detail when writing because you would likely want to share it with other people. Another example is when choosing a class, if your parents wanted you to take art and you didn't like to draw, then you would either fail, not try, or just hate the class. However, if you choose to do art then you will want to work harder in that class because it is something you enjoy doing.\n \n Coming up with ideas can be a difficult task for some, but telling students to create a project will help make them become more of a creative thinker. If you gave someone a problem they will try to come up with solutions to fix it, and this will help a them show some creativity to come up with a solution. An example would be if you told students there is a problem with a nearby lake and ask them to think of ways to fix it. It will make the students think about what could cause the problem and ways to fix it.\n \n Teachers giving the same topic to lots of students can case some to feel more pressure then if it was their own project. The reason is if everyone needs to present the same thing, if someone makes a mistake or lies about something then everyone will know. Even if a person doesn't know about the mistake there will be someone who does and may call the presenter out on it. However, if every student is presenting a different topic then they will teach people about something they might not have known before.\n \n There are still some that believe that the teacher should design the project. These people may argue that this will help a student stay on topic and ensure that a student will do something challenging to them. While that may be true, some people might not like the topic chosen and will either not do it or find a way to make it easier to do. Another argument is that some students might just choose a topic that someone else is doing and will copy all the work. If a teacher gives everyone the same project as each otherÂ then people could copy off on one another much easier, since its all about the same thing.\n \n Students should be the ones designing their summer projects. This will give them a chance to tell others about their interests, help students develop more creative problem solving skills, and will make students more comfortable sharing about their topic.",

    Essay:
      "I think that all people could agree that school is important. Learning is important. It is how humans grow and change through our lives. New things are learned every day, especially while in school. In school, we sit down for about seven hours a day to learn material provided and explained by teachers, for nine out of twelve months of each year. Summer projects, if assigned by a school, should be designed by the student, and not the teacher, in order for students to deepen interests and research topics that may not be provided in a school setting.\n \n While schools continue to grow and change, and add new electives based off of future careers that interest many students, they can not have electives that will interest every student in the school. Electives such as tech ed, cooking courses, and cyber security are offered in my school, which help those students who would like to explore those career areas in the future, can only teach a limited amount of material and provide interests to only a limited number of students. A summer project created and designed by a student would have a completely unlimited amount of subjects that they could explore. Students would be able to create a project based off of something that they are truly interested in, or may already be good at.\n \n By the time most students are getting ready to graduate high school, apply to colleges or pick their major for the the first time, they have no clue what to do because high school didn't provide them with the opportunity to explore many interests. It is a major flaw in the way that the education system works, especially in the United States, because we are taught the important subjects; such as math, which can be applied in many careers, science which is required for all medical careers and many more, history which is important to know, so that it doesn't repeat itself, and english, which once you get up to a certain point, only applies to a very limited number of professions. It would not help students to do yet another project based off of a subject they have years to sit in a classroom and learn about. Students should be able to explore what interests them, outside of those mandated subjects. A summer project where a student has freedom to learn what they desire to learn about could look like, a girl who wants to explore architecture and builds a small structure, or a boy who wants to be firefighter and decides to volunteer at his local fire station, which he might not have time for during the school year. It could also be a way for a student that has no clue in the world what they want to do, to learn about a carer so different from anything they have learned in school.\n \n Summer is designed to be a break for students, I believe that most students would find it much less frustrating and more willing to do their best with a project, if they could do anything with it they wanted to. A project designed by the student would require much more imagination than a project with a rubric and instructions already provided by a teacher. Students would create something with passion and they would have desire more desire to learn if they could choose what it would be about.\n \n Some may argue that a project with stricter learning guidelines and design guidelines created by a teacher would be more benefit that a project created by the student, but it is evident that students learn the way teachers would like us to learn for our entire school year. We learn our lessons the from the teacher and we take the tests created by the teacher who wrote our lessons. A project based off of a student's imagination would be very different from what a typical project designed by a teacher would look like, but it would be very different in the best way.",

      "Every student has expierienced that one teacher who tries to give homework over break. Most Students look forward to summer break due to the fact that they have waited all year to be let out of school and have fun. With those statements put out there some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. They want students to continue learning over the summer. Schools should allow students to decide what projects they have to do over the summer. Reasons for this include students have to complete these assignments so they should design them, these assignments should be something they enjoy, they know what they need practice on. Therefore, this paper will elaborate on why this is the correct way to go.\n \n Students should be able to pick their assignments because they are the ones that are going to have to complete it. Yes, the teachers may assist the students in the proccess, but the student will be the one to complete the project ,and is expected for them to learn from it. Summer time for every student is supposed to be fun instead of being filled with work and stress. Yes, it is good for students to learn but, a break is for the student to relax because they have spent their entire school year working hard. A student should not have to spend their summer break doing school work because schools want them to learn more when school is done for the year. some might argue that only the teachers know what is best for the student becuase they teach them. However, if teachers were to decide what the students should complete the students may not try complete the assignments. Therefore, this may cause the students to not learn anything at all, and they will slowly become unmotivated.\n \n Another important thing to remember is the students should be able to do something they enjoy. It should not feel like school all over again, these projects should allow them feel like they are still on a summer break. Meaning students should not be overloaded with work and they should be given enough time to complete it. keeping in mind that they may have other summer plans. Especially not to where the student feels like giving up and feel to tired to continue on with their learning goals. Some educators will bring up the fact that everything that is good is not always fun but, they should want students to enjoy the things they do. This will allow students to still be able to enjoy their vacation, and be able to relax. Students should not feel like they are being forced to learn therefore, teachers of all grade levels would agree that students learn better when they are having fun. These assignments can be made fun by making the projects group related, or the students being able to win cool prizes.\n \n Lastly, the students know what they need help on the most, every individual student has diffrent learning abilities. Ever student has subjects that they struggle with and subjects that they are successful in. Therefore, the students should each be able to pick their own individual projects that will help them in the long run. If schools are suggesting that students still learn even after the year is over then, it is best that the teachers assist the students in what they pick but, they should let the students decide on their own. However many individuals would disagree and say the teacher knows best becauase she teaches the students but, this doesnt mean much because only that individual knows what they truly stuggle with and want to learn. Students should be able to choose whatever subject they desire as long as they can learn something from it. The schools should want their students to strive and be successful in every way possible even if that means they have to take their own path.\n \n Overall, students should be able to take their own route when it comes to knowing whats best for them. Students should be considered more when it comes to learning. Students should be able to make their learning expierience fun, students know what they need help with, and students are the ones that have to complete these assignments. No student is the same, every individual has diffrent needs and some schools fail to understand that. There are always lots of ways to tackle issues when it comes to learning. It can be a good expierience for everyone if every individual is taken into consideration. The main goal is for every student to learn something over the summer, this can be achieved as long as students remain as the main priority.",

      "Though I do not like summer projects, as I feel summer is a time to relax, if we are going to be assigned summer projects, they should be designed by students, not teachers. Most teachers do not understand us kids just want to have fun during the summer and not have to worry about some project worth 20% of our first nine weeks grade. It causes uneccesary stress during what should be a stress-free break and a student-designed project would reduce that stress.\n \n Something designed by a student is most likely going to be fun, like taking some pictures or making a little movie, not reading a boring book no one has heard of and then answering questions about it. No one wants to do anything like that during their breaks. A fun project is also more likely to be done. It is common sense that people are more willing to do something if it is entertaing and not tedious. Especially students.\n \n Furthermore, it is going to be many desgrees less stressful. If something is designed by a student, it will be made in a way that is not stressful at all. Most students do not want that added weight and responsibilty during summer break. As I stated before, many of us have jobs, and we do not need that extra stress.\n \n However, a teachers project would actually be educational and will most likely be designed to keep you on your toes. We tend to forget things we learned last year over the summer, so it is a good thing teachers give us work; even if we do not want it. But it is called break for a reason. But if we get work, might as well be fun.\n \n So in conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed. It is less stressful, more enjoyable, and it would take much less time from our break. Though teacher-designed would be more enriching, we can worry about learning subjects and remembering them during school, and not our break.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay:
      "To test students on their knowledge, teachers have begun to assign projects rather than traditional tests. There has been a debate on if these projects should be designed by teachers or by students. I believe these summer projects need to be teacher- designed. The teachers have much more experience at designing projects, the students may assign themselves an easier project, and the teachers get payed tax revenue for the sole purpose of teaching children and designing projects.\n \n The first major reason these projects should be teacher- designed is that teachers have experience in creating projects. Most teachers have gone through many years of education to get where they are today. They have gained skills and insight that most students do not have. Because teachers have this experience and knowledge, they know how they can force their students to display what they know. A project is meant to be a creative display of the collective information students have learned. Because students have not been prepared in education, they do not have the skills to properly design a project for other students. Some people may argue that when teachers let students design their own projects, they are teaching them important skills such as problem solving. Although their problem solving skills may be tested, they are still more likely to design a less efficient project due to their lack of education preparation.\n \n Where as a student lacks this education preparation, a teacher has spent years gathering it. Teachers can use their knowledge to create the perfect project for the class.\n \n Another reason projects should be designed by teachers is that the students may try to design an easier project so they can complete it quicker. As a student myself, I know that many students will try to get out of work if they can. Every school has issues with students not completing their assignments. When given the power to chose their work load, students most often pick an easier assignment. When most teachers assign a project, they do not want it to be a quick and easy task for the students. A project is meant to challenge the student. Students typically try to avoid such challenges. Students, like all humans on earth, are flawed. From my own high school experience, I know that I would design my project to give me the best chance of receiving an excellent grade. If students are forced to design projects, projects will become less efficient in displaying what a student understands. Teachers are more willing to challenge the students and help them grow.\n \n The final reason that teachers should design projects is that they are payed to do so. A significant portion of American tax revenue is used to pay teachers who work across the country. When teachers force students to design projects, the teacher is pawning off his or her own work to the students. Many tax- paying citizens would be incredibly upset to see their taxes go to waste. If teachers are allowed to pawn off their work and still get payed, it sets a very poor example for the young, impressionable students. It teaches the students that you can make others do your work just so you can receive the credit. It would be unethical for any teacher to force their own student into fulfilling the job and tasks of a teacher.\n \n In conclusion, all school projects should be designed by the teacher because it would be morally irresponsible if they did not. Projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more education preparation than students, the students tend to avoid hard work, and teachers are payed to design projects and classwork. If we allow students to design projects, the American education system would be doing a great disservice to the young students of today, and the the leaders of tomorrow.Â  Â",

      "It is much more enjoyable to have the freedom to explore individually. This freedom allows individuals to reach their full potential. Schools that assign summer projects should give students the privilege to explore their interests, while encouraging creativity. Furthermore, schools that assign summer projects should allow students to design their own project because all students are under different circumstances and students should be allowed to be creative, especially in environments outside of school.\n \n It is inevitable for students to have different interests, hobbies, and circumstances. For example, some students may enjoy staying in the comfort of their home while others may enjoy the adventures of the outdoors. All students partake in different activities during the summer; it could include a summer job, sports team, or vacations. All of these factors influence a student's life, and this sets one student apart from another. Each student should be able to incorporate the experiences of their summer break into their project, eliminating the regulatory aspect of a teacher-designed project.\n \n For some students, regulation and routine can be exhausting. The whole school year is an on-going cycle of the same routine, with little variations. Summer break should quite literally be a break from that, allowing students to stray away from the same routine. For this reason, schools should encourage creativity and free-will through summer projects. Furthermore, allowing students to design their own project gives them a sense of control which might encourage students to actually complete the project.\n \n Some may argue that student-designed projects are a bad idea because students need discipline and the possibility that the goal of continuous learning would not be achieved is greater. This argument is false because discipline is not always effective. Guiding students down the right path while encouraging their own ideas is a more effective approach to helping students learn. Even though a clear outline of directions are given to the student, if a student finds no enjoyment in the process, then it is less likely the project will even be completed. The goal is not to control the student, but to aid the process of learning.\n \n Simply giving students the freedom to design their own projects allows then to take advantage of their different circumstances and opportunities while implementing creativity. Assigning summer projects to assure students continue learning is an excellent idea, but allowing students to design their own projects may be more effective because all students are different. Anyone can complete a project with step-by-step instructions, but what matters is what is learned through the process. One set of explicit directions cannot satisfy every single students' needs and/or wants in a learning environment. In conclusion, the process of completing the project is more important than just getting it done.",

      "Should Summer projects be teacher or student-designed?\n \n Summer projects are a big thing for most schools.\n \n It gives the students to do something over the long break and make sure their brain is still doing school work and thinking.\n \n Some summer projects are packets that teach you what you will be learning in your next math class or an entire book you will need to read for english or even a 2 page essay for your history class.\n \n No student wants to do these projects because they aren't fun, and they are supposed to be on a break from school, they shoudn't have to be doing homework that they don't want to do.\n \n Summer projects should be student-desgined.\n \n If they get to pick what they get to do research on and get to show it in their own creative way I am sure they will want to do it way more, than if it was a teacher-designed project where they would have to do it a specific way.\n \n If you are on break you should be having fun, so shouldn't a Summer project be fun too?\n \n There are so many different ways you can make a project fun, in the students interest and use the students creativity.\n \n They can make a slideshow on google like most students do now, if they are an artist they can make a cartoon, if they like directing they can make a short movie, if they are writers they can make a mini book, if they like planning they can make a brochure, and if they like being creative they can make a poster.\n \n There are endless options on what a student can make for their project.\n \n If they are have other creative school appropritate ideas they can ask their teacher if they can do that instead.\n \n Think about it, if you get a boring old project that no one wants to do then most likely they will throw it together last minute or won't do it at all;\n \n especially if they don't do their school work anyways.\n \n It is like forcing an artist to write or vise versa.\n \n Doing their project in their own way, they like will make it so much more fun and interesting.\n \n They can do it any way that is school appropriate and show their talents and interests while making it.\n \n Like an inspring director can make a mini movie, or an artist can make a cartoon.\n \n There are so many different ideas out there it would make the project much more fun.\n \n People think if it is teacher-designed it will be neat.\n \n I disagree, if they are forced to do their project a certain way they will make it sloppy, and not put a lot of effort in because they would be forced to do something they might not be good at.\n \n Projects can be a pain, and be super hard or a lot of work sometimes.\n \n Students will want to do the long, a lot of work project if they can make it their own.\n \n If they are forced to do it a certain way they won't want to do it, and it won't get done.\n \n \"What if it is a grade and they have to do it?\"\n \n Some might say, well they can still throw it together and could possibly get a good grade on it, or the student might not care about their grade and might not do it.\n \n Student love showing their creativity, it can show some of their cool talents.\n \n If they can make their project their own and do it any way they want to, they would do it for fun.\n \n Many students love doing projects their own way because they can show their creativity and cool talents.\n \n Someone can do their project even as a song if they love singing, and their friend can make it into a music video if they like editing and directing.\n \n They are so many fun and endless ways to make a Summer project if it was student-desgined.\n \n Summer projects can be a lot, but if they were student-designed so many students would love to do their project.\n \n They would be able to do it any way they want to and use their minds to make something amazing with their own creativity.\n \n There are so many options like making a movie, making a slideshow, making a mini book, making a cartoon, making a poster, making a song, making a brochure.\n \n There are so many more, I am sure students can make their hobby into a project and pull something together that would be so fun to make.\n \n Summer projects should be fun since they are during the Summer break.\n \n You are supposed to be having fun, and having a break from school.\n \n This is why I think Summer projects should be student-designed instead of being teacher-desgined.Â Â",

    Essay:
      "Why is it important for the teachers to assign summer projects during the long summer break? It is important for the teacher to assign summer projects during long summer break, because it is assures that; the students continues learning during the summer break. Summer break is a long break where students usually forget what they did and studied last year. So, it is better to for the teachers to assign summer projects, so the students can come better prepared and ready for the classes after a long summer break. Teacher- designed projects are usually school appropriate, focuses more on the main idea, and easy for the teachers to grade the assignment.\n \n Teacher- designed projects helps the students to focus on the main idea. It does not distract the students to go off the topic and focus more on what teacher wants and expects from us. It is also helps the students to full-fill the teachers requirement, for example; In the future, it would help the college students because they would be more prepared and ready for it. College professors usually assign really hard projects so it would be hard and difficult for the students to do. They also wants us to not go off topic because they don't like students giving extra information that is useless. If students have multiple choices to work on, they usually get confused and don't know what topic is best for them to choose. It gets really hard for the students if they make their own choices so it is better for the teacher to assign or design a project that has been approved by the teachers department.\n \n Grading projects for the professor/ teachers is an easy task if the students chose to do the projects that they have assigned. If the students choose to design/ create the project on their own. It would be kind of hard for the teachers to grade the assignment. They might get confused on what the actual topic is and would not get a good grade unless you have enough information for the teacher to understand. For example, during the end of the sophomore year we got a research project to do to get a GPA\n \n boost. In order, to get the GPA boost I needed to do good on the research assignment. Me and my partner chose a topic that was not a teacher's choice topic and it was about testing goldfish in different water levels. The teacher told us that it would be a hard topic to choose as she did this sort of assignment during the college days before becoming a teacher. We both still chose to do it and took a risk, in the end most of the goldfish died during the experiment and our research assignment didn't went that well as we thought it would be. Me and my partner didn't receive a good grade, we got a B- on the research project. After that I decided to always choose a topic that has been assigned by the teacher because they already been more experienced and chose what is easy for us to do. This year research assignment is assigned by our teacher and it is much more easier for us to do as it is assigned by the teacher and until now we have been getting good grades and just waiting for the final part to complete. It is better to always listen to your teachers point of view because it might help you in the future and you might end with a good grade, even you get your teacher's guidance for the project.\n \n Teachers- designed projects are usually checked by the academies of Generic_School or the head of the teachers department to assure that it is school prohibited. Projects should be school appropriate because students usually choose topics that might not be appropriate for schools. Teachers/ professors knows best what school assignments are appropriate and what are not. If the project is not school appropriate, you might get a straight zero in your grade book and a comment written, it was not a school appropriate project that's why your kid got a zero on your report card. Student-designed project can be easy for them unless, it is school appropriate and meet the certain requirements that has been provided by the teacher. For example, in the show ''the vampire diaries\", Generic_Name chose to do an assignment for a history project. It was about the witches and vampires and how they were created and how many are there. This was not a school appropriate project for a high school student to research about this kind of topic. So he received a zero on this assignment. Generic_Name teacher talked to him about the project and gave him a second chance to do a topic that is related to history.\n \n In conclusion, teacher- designed projects are best for the students because it would help the students to focus more on what criteria to meet and what are our teacher's expectations. It would be much more easier for the teacher to grade and help us on the assignment that she has designed for us. Teacher would assign or create a project that would be useful for us in the future and might help us in many ways. Teacher creates an assignment that is school appropriate because if it is not school appropriate then you'll straight get a zero on the assignment. Teacher chooses the topic are easier and helpful in way for their students. Teachers assignments can sometimes be really hard and too difficult at times that you might get confused on what information to put and what not to. Though, some of the school requires the teacher's to design a project not the student's because it is out of schools law because if they do something wrong, the teacher gets into trouble. Teachers should give summer assignments to the students during summer break because it is very long break and children usually forget. So the teacher creates these assignments for the students to relearn and get more knowledge through projects that might help them in future or their career. However, I think that teachers should be the one designing the projects because it keeps the teacher assure that students are learning important information that might be helpful in their future.",

    Essay:
      "During the summer, many students usually do not do anything school related during this time. They would most likely forget what they had learned from the previous school year. Some schools have given the students projects to do during the summer but the projects are usually designed by teachers. However, it would be better if the projects were designed by the students themselves.\n \n When a student designs a summer project, it would give them more motivation to work on it. If people were to do things they wanted, it would make them more comfrontable and motivated to perform the task. Whenever there are summer assignments, they are usually made by teachers. Some students will still work on the project, but it would be more easier to do if the students were the ones who made the project. A student would usually prefer if they could design the summer assignment themself instead of the teacher.\n \n Having the students create the summer project can also be enjoyable for them. Usually when a person does something they want to do, it would usually be something of their interest. Students would less likely perform a task if it were something that did not interest them or that was disliked by the them. Having a school project designed by students would further make the students more motivated to design and complete the summer assignment since they would create it in a style they are interested in.\n \n Letting a student design their own summer project would also show what the student still remembers any knowledge from the school year and put it into the project. If students did not have much interests or lacked enough content to put into the project, they would most likely add content they had still remembered from the school year into the school project and this would help show if letting the students design the project was effective or not in terms of what they had still remembered from the school year.\n \n With all the ideas the students could have in designing a summer project, there are still some issues that can occur when a student designs the summer assignment. They could go off track with the project and not put in any academic related content into the project. There are also a few times where a student might actually lack ideas to add into the project which later might end up not having much of a project at all. However, this is why there are summer projects, it is to have students continue learning during the summer. Schools should still have the students design the project themselves.\n \n Students will most likely forget what they have learned if they were not given a summer project. But if they were given one and had to design it themselves, it would have many benefits such as: giving them more motivation, enjoying the project whenever they work on it, and showing what they have learned from the school year. That way, the students would overall continue learning through the summer while also enjoying themselves.",

    Essay:
      "The time off of school during summer break is always looked forward to by students and teachers, but it doesn't mean the school work stops. Summer projects are a way to ensure that students can continue to learn information over the break, but many students would not want to complete them. Although teacher-designed projects would be beneficial for learning in more detail, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows for the students to be more creative, have more freedom, and be more engaged in their project. Student-designed projects allow for students to feel like the project is less of a requirement, and rather more of an enjoyable activity.\n \n Creativity is exactly what students need in order to complete projects in a more effective way. When students design their own project, they let their minds flow freely. This allows for the creation of projects that the students actually are interested in, which helps them become more engaged about whatever the project was about. It is a common belief that teachers should design projects so they can get their students to learn exactly what they need to, and that a student-designed project is not sufficient enough because students will not learn what they need to. However, a project by students allows them to learn content even better because they are choosing what they want to create, not being assigned it, and this creation allows them to explore content in a way that a teacher can't provide. For example, if a student had to create an instrument for music class from scratch, they would be a lot more interested in that than just making a variation of a particular instrument again. The creativity in designing a project is what students need to learn content in a way that is interesting to them, which helps them learn better during a time period where they don't even want to be doing work.\n \n When a student designs their own project, there are very few restrictions applied. This is good because the students can learn required content however they want to, and they will most often choose to learn it in a way that is effective for them, which a teacher can't always provide. There is the argument that teachers can just give students a variety of options to choose from with a project, and that that freedom in choice will help students learn in a way beneficial to them but unfortunately that just isn't the case. Many students never get to create a project that they actually want to make, and teachers often just repeat options over and over again that students are already familiar with. For example, what if a teacher just kept giving out the same current events question, and a student never got to answer the question they were actually interested in? The freedom in designing a project allows a student to actually want to learn content, since they choose a way to learn content that would be fun to them. A student-designed project over summer would allow students to freely choose how they want to learn, which is exactly what is needed since many students do not feel motivated to work on school over summer.\n \n Many students who complete projects throughout their school careers are not engaged in their work, and are just focused on getting a project done by the deadline with all the requirements. A student-designed project would allow students to feel more engaged in their work and not just worry about when it's due, but rather what they are learning throughout the process. Many people think that teachers can fix this problem by allowing students to choose what is required in the project, for example requiring students to pick 15 vocabulary words out of 30 to include in a newspaper project. This just isn't the same as letting a student pick out what they design though, as students would actually feel motivated to create a good project since it is something they want to complete. Students would feel more engaged in their project and feel like it was less forced if they had the ability to design it themselves.\n \n Required summer projects by some schools would be most beneficial if they were student-designed, because it would allow for students to be more creative, feel more freedom, and be more engaged in the overall process of learning through a project. This is especially important for summer projects because many students in the summer do not want to do any school work, so a teacher assigning a student another forced project would not motivate them to complete it, while if the student got to design it themselves, they would be more interested and likely create a better project while learning more. Teachers do have the ability to design a project that students would enjoy, but the student-designed project truly allows for more learning by the students because it is more entertaining and an overall better experience.",

    Essay:
      "What is something that interests you or a certain subject that interests you? This is a question that schools, who require students to complete summer projects, should ask the students. It is very important to understand what interests the students who are doing these projects. When students are doing a project they are not interested in, they are not as creative with it and they do not learn as much. I know from personal experience that when I am doing a project that interests me, I do so much better and I learn so much more about the subject. It is very beneficial for both the students and the teachers. If some students do not like it or are not interested enough, they might end up not doing the project or getting a really bad grade on it. I believe student-designed projects would be the best way to go because they will learn better and more efficiently, they will get better grades, which is very important, and it will help them learn throughout their break so that they learn so much more.\n \n The first reason that I think student-designed projects would be better, is because they will be more interested in it if they pick something that they are passionate about. The project could be about subjects in school like Math, Science, English, or anything that is related to nature because those are some beneficial things to learn about. I know, from experience, that doing a project that interests you is so much more beneficial. When I was a freshman, my English teacher explained to us that we had to write a paper about something that we are passionate and feel very strongly about. We had to finish this paper by the time our summer break was over. It really helped a lot of my fellow classmates learn so much more about the things they are so passionate about. It was so beneficial to all of us. When we got back to school after summer break, everyone got to share what they wrote about. It was very interesting to hear everyone's point of view on certain things. I really enjoyed it.\n \n Another reason that student-designed projects would be better, is because students can be so much more creative with them. For example, if you really love flowers and you are making a big poster project, you can be so creative with it. You can go out and take beautiful pictures, you can draw and color flowers, and you can search for interesting facts about them. Their are so many interesting things to learn about in the world. Students with creative minds should be given the ability to use them in their own way; therefore, I strongly believe they should be able to design their own projects and be creative and spontaneous with them. In order to do the projects, they still need the teacher's consent, but if it is beneficial and helps them learn, the teacher should be fineÂ with it. It is amazing to see what students can do with all their creativity. The teachers can learn so much about their students' ability when they let them get creative.\n \n The third reason I believe student-designed projects are better, is because it can help both the teachers and the students. If teachers just give every student the same project, some students may decide they can cheat off of their friends, especially if they are not interested in the project or just do not want to do it. If you let them design it and let them do the project about something that they love or are interested in, they will not be able to cheat and will do it on their own. It can also help the students get a better grade on it. If the students are getting better grades on it, then the teachers know that they actually learned something over summer break. I think it is very important to keep learning even over break because it keeps your brain fresh and ready to roll when school comes back around.\n \n It is very important to know and understand what interests your students. Many students are so creative but some never get to use their creativity in school, especially if what they are doing does not interest them. It is very important to let them use their artistic abilities or any other talents they have by doing student-designed projects. Student-designed projects are better for learning and could be beneficial for students in the future even after they get out of school. They can learn many skills from doing them and it will help them continue learning. I strongly encourage teachers to let their students design their summer break projects for not only their benefit, but also for the students'. Â Â Â  Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "I think the summer projects should be student-designed, why ? during the summer students would not like to think about any school work. It's good to go over and have work from school during your break so when you come back you can earn new material without forgetting. However a teacher-designed could work also, students don't want to feel like we're still in school during our whole break. Our break is to have fun and go out and enjoy the weather and ourselves. Now we are going to go in detail and talk about both opinions of the argument.\n \n For the teacher-designed many students will agree to that. Teachers will have to come back the last month to get their classroom situated, and they plan throughout the summer and go to training. Some teachers might be changed to a different subject to teach. Instead of giving work packets, teachers can email work to do online and the students might do it. And some teachers will be seeing students during break because of summer school, for the teachers whose teaching there they can ask for their work while sitting with them.\n \n The student-designed, some might agree and disagree. Some students feel as if their summer break purpose is to take a break from school work. Some kids don't have a problem with remembering what they learned the last school year. Others naturally study and go over anything they struggled with. And the students who don't mind won't have a problem with doing projects over their break.\n \n The disagreeing part, many students feel as if they worked hard and deserve a break. Some students be busy while out of school, some work and attend camps. For ones who do other stuff might not have enough time to get the projects done on time. Many just not do it because there is no school. Being that it's not no school they might think it's not counted against them.\n \n My opinion on it, is that I think that the summer projects should be teacher-designed, it'll loosen a lot of other things that needs to be done in the summer time during break.",

      "Imagine learning about school during summer break. School should not require students to do summer projects in the summer time. Also school shouldn't ruin students free time. Students shouldn't have to worry about school during their free time.\n \n Student designed projects would be way better than teacher designed projects because students have more imagination therefore it would make the project more interesting. If students designed summer projects it would make learning in the summer time better for students. Also if students design these summer projects it would be more students looking forward to learning during the summer because students know what is interesting to each other. And if students design summer projects there will be more into learning about school during summer.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because they can influence their peers to be smarter. Also if they are designed by students it can keep people off the streets. It can also bring people together and stop a lot of bullying. And when students come together they can make a big impact on the community and influence other to be smart.\n \n Students make everything interesting. School should be a place where you can have fun while learning. If summer projects was teacher designed it wouldn't be fun and nobody would come to school during the summer time. Students can bring the best out of each other and lift each other up when they are feeling down.\n \n Students can bring the best out of other students better than teachers can.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer assignments to make sure that they continue learning over the long summer break. There has been some debate on whether or not these assignments should be designed by students, or designed by teachers. Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because; teachers can create assignments specifically tailored to their class, teachers can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with, and most of the students are not familiar enough with the material to create an assignment by themselves.\n \n The first reason reason why teachers should design their own summer assignment is that the teacher can create an assignment that is specifically tailored for their class. A teacher knows both what material the students will be learning and how they will go about learning it. A teacher could use this knowledge to create an assignment that creates prior learning in an area that they will not cover as much. This will make sure that the students have a greater understanding of a topic withoutÂ needing to take valuable class time to learn it. An example of an assignment like this would be a required reading. Students would be required to read a book about a topic selected by the teacher and complete an assignment to demonstrate understanding of the text. The teacher's contact information would be made available to the students so that any important questions could be answered. With an assignment like this, the students are functionally teaching themselves over the summer. A teacher could also use this assignment to create interest in the class. A teacher could compile all of the topics that students typically find interesting into a sort of class preview that will make students more curious about the class. This curiosity could create a better work environment and allow students to learn even more over the year.\n \n The second reason why teachers should design their own summer assignments is because they can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with. Teachers are aware of which subjects students generally struggle with, and can use that information to help future students. Teachers can use the summer assignment for this by creating prior knowledge about the more difficult subjects. If the students are already somewhat familiar with the material, it will take less class time to teach it. This leaves more time to answer individual questions and help students understand the specific parts that the class is struggling with. An example of how a teacher could do this is by assigning a research paper. If the students are free to do their own research, they will develop an interest in the topic over the course of the writing. The students will be essentially teaching an entire difficult subject to themselves. The students could then present their essay to the class to show their individual findings. The class will teach each other about their own findings until every individual is competent in the subject. The teacher's contact information should be made available so that any questions that come up can be answered, but the students should rely mostly on other credible sources for their information.\n \n The final reason why teachers should create their own summer assignments is because students are not familiar enough with the material to create assignments for themselves. All the information that students usually have about a class before they take it is the title of the class, and a brief description of the material. The students know almost nothing going into a class while teachers have experience teaching the subject and know how to best introduce it to students. There can be no argument for students creating their own assignments because they are simply not knowledgeable enough to design a focused and useful assignment. If students were to create their own assignments, there would be several problems. One main issue is that the students' projects would not be focused on the acutal course, but on what they thought the couse was loosly about. Students do not know much going into a class and can not possibly know enough about the class to create a well designed assignment that will effectively introduce them to the material. Another issue is that students will try to make it easier on themselves. Students do not always have the best work ethics ,especially over the summer. If given the choice, they will always choose an easier rout even if it means sacrificing a part of their education. If students are allowed to create their own assignments, they will most likely create something that is not challenging at all and therefor not useful. If a summer assignment is not neither challenging nor introducing new material, it is functionally useless. The final issue is the fact that teachers will have no way to accurately grade an entirely student created project. The teacher has no way of judging quality if the details of the assignment are unclear. If each individual comes in with a different assignment, the teacher will have no choice but to hand out arbitrary grades based on nothing at all. A project without a rubric is impossible to grade.\n \n There aresome schools that require students to complete assignments over their summer break. The objective of these assignments is to ensure that the students continue to learn over the long summer break. There has been debate about whether or not these summer assignments should be designed by teachers or by students. The summer assignments should be designed by teachers for a multitude of reasons including; teachers can create assignments specifically tailored to their class, teachers can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with, and most of the students are not familiar enough with the material to create an assignment by themselves.",

    Essay:
      "Whether students and teachers like it or not, some schools require students to still learn over their summer breaks. One way that these students have to learn is through projects. These projects should be teacher-designed instead of student designed for many different reasons. Although students can be smart, they are not experts on the field that the project would be based on, so for a better chance of more accurate learning, students should leave the project designing for their teachers. Teachers are also the ones who create the lesson plans, so they know what students need to know for the course, making them better candidates for creating the projects than students are. Lastly, student-designed projects can be harder to grade than teacher-designed projects. For these reasons, students should not be forced to create summer projects for their peers; the job of being a teacher should be left for the teachers.\n \n Not every single student in every single class is at the mastery level of a topic. Kids who have a 99% over all for the class still do not know everything that their is to know about a specific subject. Teachers on the other hand go to school for the subject they want to teach and teach the same class repeatedly. This lets them specialize in what they teach and have constant reminders about how to do what needs to be done for the subject. These years of experience that teachers have in their field should not be wasted by letting students design projects. Students often make mistakes, and other students should not have to learn how to do these mistakes simply because a student designed a project rather than the teacher, a professional in the field.\n \n Students are not the ones who design and follow lesson plans for their academic courses. Teachers are the ones who make the lesson plans and know which materials students are responsible for knowing and not knowing as well. Since these teachers know what students need to learn and the point of these summer projects is simply for learning, this is another reason why students should not be designing these projects. Making a students who does not know the entire course layout of the class or the time period in which each subject in the class needs to be learned makes this task to heavy to put onlyÂ on students. Students who have not created an entire lesson plan based on what needs to be taught and learned throughout the year should not be forced to then come up with a summer based project to teach their peers, when they do not even know what needs to be taught in what specific time period.\n \n Finally, student-made projects could have more potential grading complications that teacher-made projects. Students still not fully having mastered the subject if left to grade might incorrectly mark another students project since they do not fully understand the subject themselves. Also if a student is the one responsible for grading, they may overlook or even correct their friends projects simplyÂ to help them get a better grade or to not feel the guilt that comes with marking off something of you friend's work. On the other hand, if teachers are the ones grading student-designed projects, there is the chance that teachers will not understand the student's rubric that they created or there is even a chance that the teachers will not even understand what the students are hoping to accomplish through the project(s) that they have created. To keep grading accurate and fair, teachers should be the ones to both design and grade these summer projects.\n \n There are too many complications that come with making students design projects for their peers. Students are not experts on the subjects, so making them create projects over professionals in the subject is not fair to the students or their peers who need these summer projects to learn from. These students are also not the ones who make lesson plans, so they do not know what should be taught in what amount of time. Lastly, for grading fairness, it is better to have teachers be the ones to design and grade these summer projects. Although the idea of letting students create these projects for their peers can be fun and help with their learning of the subject, there are too many other avoidable complications that can be solved by leaving teachers to be the ones in chargeÂ of these projects. Teachers should be the ones doing the jobs of teaching, not students.Â  Â Â Â",

      "The project should be student-designed for various reasons. Children of any age have very creative minds and that could be very good when it comes to this project. Being that it is a summer project, it would be a lot easier on the students to make the project student-designed. A lot of children have jobs or get jobs in the summer so it would be better on those kids and others to have a self-designed project. The project being student-designed would cause students to pick their strongest topics, get more creative, and manage their time properly.\n \n Students should be able to plan their own projects. If the students were able to plan the project, they could pick a topic they felt they were strong in. Having a teacher pick your theme or topic could be very hard if you were not strong on the topic they picked. For example, a teacher assigns a project on the solar system and that child doesn't know much about it, it's not going to be a A+ project. The student knows a lot about Albert Einstein, but he could not pick his own topic. Student-designed wouldÂ resultÂ to better grades.Â A self-designed project would let the teacher know how her students think and what they feel they are strong in.\n \n Also, you could get more creative when the project is self designed. When you come up with an idea by yourself it makes the project well put together. Students would be able to incorporate all their true colors, true feelings, and lots of meaning into this project. You have no limits when you are designing something that you feel strongly about. For example, with a teacher-designed project you have limits such as a certain amount of words, color, and size. For some students those kind of rules are hard to follow because they want to express their inner self.\n \n Lastly, making the project student designed would result to better grades and finished products. Students would know how much time everything takes to get done and they would not be rushed. Not having a rushed project would result to more passing grades. Students would be more comfortable presenting because they know their projects does not look have to look like everyone's project. They would also let people know how they think by the amount of color, drawings, and length of the project.\n \n In conclusion, it would be a good idea to make the project self-designed. Students have a different mind set from everyone else, so it would be a good way to see how each one thinks. Having a student-designed project could benefit both the teacher and the student in many ways. The teacher could learn a lot about the school year ahead of her and what kind of students she going to have. And students would find their inner selvesÂ and natural talent without even knowing. The project should be an student-designed project because students could pick their strongest topics, get more creative, and manage their time properly.Â",

    Essay:
      "I believe students should design summer projects instead of teachers, what do you think? i believe so and here is why. Most students think more alike other students because most of them have the same knowledge than others but. That doesn't mean that the whole school will have students that could think like teachers. By all means this proves that there is a lower chance those students with high developed knowledge will be the ones doing the summer projects for others to complete. The students that do create some of the summer projects will make sure not to make them to hard or to easy that way the students doing them can surly keep learning during break withoutÂ stressing about it. The students that make the summer project will also make them easier for there fellow classmates. Some of the students that are doing the summer project could be stressing about it but that also means they won't make it to difficult because they would want to get over with it already and focus on something else to get there minds distracting. So that we they cannot be thinking so much about school. As wellÂ as the students doing them won't stress as much about them because they'll know it's not to difficult and can do it any time during the summer, such being the last week or the last day so they can have all summer to them selves. Not having to think about school. When students aren't thinking about school that doesn't mean they're not learning it, just means they're trying to get there head off of something that highly stresses them about a lot of work or having to deal with for a long time and that's the only time they can get a break from it and not stress about school. The reason being of students doing them than instead of teachers they also won't have to do a lot of writing or work for starters. Students will be sure to not make them as long because they know what it feels like to get assigned a longÂ and stressfulÂ assignment especially over the summer break that is the only time you actually get a break from school. Students also doing the assignments will help out teachers to also get a break and focus on other important related stuff they have as well. The students creating the summer projects can also be more open mindedÂ after doing them and grow they're knowledge as wellÂ as learning better and thinking of ideas more often for school. Teachers can review the students work and see how fine they do. The students who do well creating can continue to do so if they feel goo about themselves doing it for the other students that weren't so bright at it can give out ideas and help out the students doing them. I believe other schools and principals will be impressed by having a school with students creating they're summer projects and that is wonderful. I believe that having students createÂ the summer projects is an outstanding idea for the community and school they will think of them differently and have a better picture of themselves. This argument has been good because it will open the eyes of many students and have them be brave enough to put themselves up for the challenge. If you believe students should create these summer projects instead of teachers write your own prompts to see what you guys have in mind. I think my argument is well stated and many teachers will surly think about letting it happen. Don't you believe so as well? Yes indeed you do.",

      "My name is Generic_Name, I have took the position that the summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to designed their own summer projects, because it will allow them to get as creative as they want. For an example, they can use their own pictures, color, and words.\n \n The pictures of the students self designed projects is the most important part of the project. It descibes what the person is talking about. It also provides extra details about what the student made their project to be. Pictures can describe what the people based their projects off. The pictures set off the main idea of the student summer project.\n \n The color of the student project is a color code. That means the students can use their own color to descibe one part of their project. Students can also use their color to make their summer projects colorful. In other words, color can be use to make students projects creative. The reason for the color is to make the project bigger and persuade the audience to look at it.\n \n The wodrs of the student summer project is basically to state the meaning of the project. That means it describes the Pictures, and the color they used in their project. The words are supporting details for their project. The main usage for the words in the project is to support the main idea of the project. The reason for the words is to make the the audience want to read it by supporting what the project is about.\n \n In conclusion, I will take the position that Students should be able to designed their own projects for the summer. It is easier for students to create their own projects, because their minds move faster than some teachers. some students have the ability to create fun stories for their projects.

      "Since the increase in school attendance, homework, a form of continual, at-home learning, was created to eliminate forgotten knowledge and stimulate academic development outside of the classroom. Due to this, new forms of such medium have developed transpiring into what is now know as summer assignments. Although, there is still much debate centered around if such projects should be student or teacher designed. Although, a student designed summer assignment may be beneficiary to the student in terms of difficulty and creativity, in order to better actively promote proper continual education and prepare children for their upcoming course load, all summer projects should be based off of a teacher's model.\n \n As humans are confronted with adversity, many choose the path of least difficulty. This trend of human nature can be seen dating back to the first man. Through evolution man was taught always to take the ladder of the two in order to insure survival; the modern interpretation of this instinctual thought would be classified as laziness. The average student, just like Chromagnum Man, will typically not go the extra mile if given the easier path; therefore, in order ensure proper brain stimulus and appropriateÂ student effort, a teacher-designed summer assignment is necessary.\n \n In prepare students for the upcoming challenges and expectations regarding their course selection, students must be allowed to model expectations from a given, teacher-assigned, summer assignment. Children are taught on the principles of mimicking behavior. Therefore, by modeling expectations, students are allowed to prepare for their future courses through a natural monkey-see, monkey-do pattern. In order ensure proper learning, a appropriate model for a learning basis should be given to students to better prepare for the year to come.\n \n Additionally, in order to better prepare for students' future academic course loads, teachers, as fellow advocates for education, should be inclined to facilitate proper thought processes in academics by the means of a carefully designed project. Examples of proper learning environments are already seen through the public schooling system, so inherently this should be expected at a must in order to stimulate the brain at home just as it has throughout the school year previously and to come. through this thought process is has become imperative that the modern child needs not only a active learning goal, but also a way in which to achieve it; that way comes in the form of a teacher-designed summer assignment.\n \n As previously touched on, the thought of allowing for a creative, student-designed project is one that naturally comes to the mind of many students as well as teachers; though this thought process inevitably roots from laziness. As discussed prior, the student will always take the ladder of the route eventually reverting to a lazy state if improper precautions are taken; in actuality, facilitating such behavior.\n \n Throughout this process of argument, it has become indicative that the matter in which thought is stimulated and perceived in consequential to the manner in which it is given. If given the option, most students will take the road most traveled as a natural reaction to adversity. Additionally, students must be prepared for proper course load through a guided thought process. In order to achieve a proper though process, a appropriate learning environment must be achieved at home through use of teacher modeling (a teacher-designed summer assignment). The allowance of free rain over projects under the fallacy of creativity spurs laziness over both student and educator as evident to human biology through evolution. With the facilitation of such student needs, the brain is allowed to prosper and continually develop intellectually to create yet another productive member of society.",

      "Some schools are given summer project to assure students continue learning throughout the summer. Since, the summer project is completed over the summer I believe it should be student-designed. First reason being is cause students should be able to make the project as they please as this embraces their imagination as to how they would like it to be and not just lock up any possible ideas they might have. Another being, it'll let the student complete the project to the best of their ability. Lastly, teacher-designed projects can get a bit stressful and overwhelming. Summer projects can benefit the students more if they're student-designed.\n \n Student-designed projects allow the student to create the project freely with no restraints. For example, several weeks ago my forensics teacher gave her classes a project based on serial killers. The project was all up to the student except for the fact that it had to be a cereal box. It was fairly easy, we just had to pick a serial killer that we were interested in and also write fun and interesting facts about said serial killer. Very little were bad or plain, meanwhile, others were fun and entertaining with games, crosswords, toys, and other activities! I believe since we were able to do it on our ownÂ it enabled the class to receive higher scores on the project; therefore, we should be given student-designed projects.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can get a bit excessive at times with a lotÂ of work which eventually lead to stressful and overwhelming situations. For example, before this school year started several friends of mine were gonna take AP US History, which they had received a summer project for the class. Their was summer was okay until about a week before school started. That's when they realizedÂ they should've started weeks ago as the project was a packet with several pages of questions. Frantically and desperatelyÂ they began their summer assignment, and well they may have lost some sleep due to staying up late but they ended up finishing. Although, my best friend had it the worse since she began her day with morning conditioning, followed by her going to work, and lastly afternoon practice and the stress from the summer project did't help. AP teacher-designed projects are lengthy and extra, which is why one should prefer student-designed projects.\n \n In conclusion student-designed projects allow a student to be free with their own creativity and knowledge which allows them to work to the best of their ability. Also they don't produce as much stress as the teacher-designed projects. Lastly from other people one learns some teacher-designed projects can induce more stress into ones life which leads to other negative effects. Which is why teachers should make student-designed projects to let their students creativity roam free.Â",

      "During summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. Because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. Summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. However, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn, and students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.\n \n Since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective. They know what the students need to learn based on the curriculum, so it is ideal for them to decide what they should study over the break. Students will get more out of the assignment if the teacher prepares an assignment that relates directly to what they will learn in class when school begins. It will also strengthen their knowledge and possibly reinforce what they had learned before.\n \n Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. Teachers can design projects that is relevant to the curriculum of the class and plan out what is necessary and useful to know versus what is not. In addition, teachers usually expose basic ideas and important concepts that will help students to make connections to what they learned through the summer assignment. These teacher-designed also provides some insight for the student on what to expect in the courses that they take.\n \n Having teachers make their own summer projects will expose the material that students need to know when they go back to school. It will help students to feel more comfortable coming to class and ready to begin learning. Through these projects, students have studied and have a better understanding of the curriculum of the class as the teacher directed the students on content they need to know. These projects also help students to gradually feel familiar with concepts they learn in the beginning of the school year rather than jumping straight ahead to learning something new.\n \n Not only do teacher-designed projects enforce learning and help students to get more comfortable with the content of the class, but they also prepare students before the upcoming school year begins. It is ideal for teachers to design such projects as they know most about the curriculum of the class, and it allows them to prepare a useful tool for students to study to get familiar with concepts and important ideas of the class. These projects are a small exposure of what students are expected or need to know and will help them to be more successful when they begin learning in their classes. Â Â Â",

      "Teachers should be the ones to design our summer projects for many different reasons. They know what is needed for us to know by the time the next school year comes around, most of the time they have a better understanding of what we need to learn , and if kids were to design the summer projects they will most likely forget many factors or make it too easy and not put as much effort into it. These summer projects help and make sure kids are still learning and not forgetting everything that they have been taught throughout the school year.\n \n Teachers should gather together and create the summer projects based off what they know that we will need to know for the upcoming years. This can be really helpful because most kids think that some things we learn will not be useful or won't do us any good but the only ones who really know what will be needed for the years to come, are the teachers. This can be such an advantage for the students and teachers. Instead of the teachers spending so much time in the beginning of the year going back over what we learned the year before they can just get right into the lesson because what needed to be reviewed has already been refreshed in our memories over the summer because of the project. By teachers creating the summer project, it can help make class time more valuable and it can help spend less time on reviewing things from previous years.\n \n If the students were to design the summer project way more things would come into effect, like how the project will be graded, what is on there vs. what should've been on there, and everything important we left off. As students we dont know what we need to learn that is clearly why we are being taught. Teachers have the best way of helping us understand what we need to learn and most of the time they know what is best for our learning. That is why we have teachers, so we can be taught what we need to know. Students all have different ways of learning, and yes not every teacher is can cater to every student and teach them the way they needed to be taught but at the end of the day the teachers are the ones who help us the most with our education and teach us the important things we need to know. Not every student can just come up with a summer project already knowing everything that should be incorporated into it. Teachers have a much better understanding of what needs to be taught and what we need to go over so we can understand it better and know our material.\n \n A big part in learning for many students is being challenged. Do you really think if a student designed the summer project that it will be challenging ? or will it be so easy that it doesn't really help the student grasp the concept of the material ? Many students find ways to do just the bare minimum to get them by, or they find ways to get the project done without really knowing what they are even being taught or to get it done without knowing what they are really doing. Many teachers find or have many different ways to help students understand what is being taught and also make sure that student is actually trying and getting by so easy. Most students will do what they have to do to get them by and that isnt really helping us learn.\n \n In conclusion it is in the best interests of most students if the teachers make the summer projects because they have a much better understanding of what can help us and what we need to know for the upcoming school year. In most classes the teachers spend the beginning of the school year going over material from the previous year, if the teacher makes the summer the project they can easily see what we do need to go over and what we dont and it can save us so much time in the classroom to learn new things instead of going over what we already know and have been taught.Â",

    Essay:
      "Do you believe it's fair for students to choose whatever project they want? Students shouldn't be able to choose their own project, because they could be choosing the easiest one or the least amount of work. They could also be doing something they've already done, so they wouldn't be learning anything new. Although some might agree otherwise, personal experiences, other students, and teachers prove that students should not be choosing their summer projects. .\n \n For example, personal experiences, I've learned more stuff through teacher designed summer projects. When I was assigned a book to read over summer, I thought it would be boring and I wouldn't be able to finish it. The type of book that I had to read was not my type, but I ended up loving it and was interested in finishing it. If my teacher didn't assign this project to me I would have never found out I was interested in these types of books and I would have never learned some things not only from the book, but about me. Some may disagree with this, but teacher designed summer projects help students be more responsible and get them to learn more information.\n \n Shown through other students, some take advantage of teachers who give them a student designed project and they choose something they really know and don't have to learn anything new. Some students don't like to learn anything or do anything related to school and they end up choosing the easiest way out of that school work. In this case those students who didn't want to learn anything end up with less knowledge then others in their class. By giving the whole class the same summer project, they will be all on the same page next year when they go over it and everyone will understand.\n \n Lastly teachers, they all have a different mind set, so every teacher teaches differently. A teacher could be letting their student's do anything they want for a project in class, out of class, or for summer. If one does do that, some student's may have a hard time and some may like it better that way and if they do the students may have a different amount of work on the projects which wouldn't be fair to them. Some may say otherwise; however, a teacher designed summer project will help the students learn and help the be able to work on their own. This will also help they get ready for work, so they would be able to do things on their own.\n \n This is important because some teachers don't think it affects students, but most of the time it does, students may take advantage with teachers providing a student designed summer project. When a student was able to choose all of their past summer projects and then one year they can't choose it. They would struggle and wouldn't have a teacher to help them because it's summer time. If a student is able to choose their projects all the time they wouldn't be learning anything new. This explains why student's shouldn't shouldn't be able to choose their summer projects shown through personal experiences, other students, and teachers.Â",

      "Some may argue that teacher-design projects are the best way for students to continues to learn during their break, but summer projects should be student-designed because of these three reasons: it allows the students creativity to flow through their projects, when allowed to chose what they want to do, students work better on projects;Â because learning should be fun, students tend to enjoy the work they're given when allowed to do it their own way.\n \n As children, our imagination tends to run wild, hence the crazy colorful drawings we bring home from kindergarten, or the weird concoctions we put together in our make believe kitchen; But as we get older we tend to lose that, weather it may be through age or other things, our imagination isn't as it was when we were younger. When given free will to do whatever we want on a project, students get to tap into that wild imagination we have locked away somewhere in our brain, a creativity that we don't get to use as often as we could. some of this is due to having teachers decide on what or how we should do our work. At times we are given a sheet of paper that tells us how and what our project should look like; because of this our creativity has no space in the box that we are forced to fit into. If given a chance to choose, more often than not, not only teachers, but our peers and our parents get to see what its kind of like inside our brains. Through our creativity you can learn what the person behind the creativity is like.\n \n When a student is given free will over a task given, it is a high probability that they will do their best to make the project amazing. In many cases student do better on any sort of assignment when given the chance to choose how they want to complete said assignment. One of the best feeling a student has is having a peace of mind knowing that they turned in an project that they did their best and worked hard on, and knowing that their hard work payed off. Through this, students learn to do their best in anything that they do, no matter it being school work or work outside of school. My Dad would always say \"Your school is like your second home, what you learn at home is what you will apply and use in the real world.\" Giving the chance to students, if the summer projects were to be student-designed, students will work better and harder on it than if they were teacher-designed.\n \n As I stated previously, learning should be fun. it is human nature to want and to enjoy presenting a project that we've worked extra hard on to our peers and our teachers. Being able to do what we want when it come to projects is enjoyable for the students and the teacher. People work better when they enjoy the task given to them. Using our creativity on a certain subject makes the learning experience enjoyable. The process in which we go through creating projects should be enjoyable. From the planing to the reaserch to assembling the the project, every step it takes can be a fun learning experience, if given the chance.\n \n As we grow up we get lesser chances of using our creativity. Having teacher-designed projects, most of the time, hinders our creativity from coming through our work. Student-designed projects will give the student a chance to show their creativity, and through this they will work better on their project, which will then make it a fun learning experience not only for them but for their peers and even their teachers.

      "Teachers have more often than not been the epicenter of academic negativity. There always has been and always will complain about teaching styles. If students could take the steering wheel, chances are they will understand the material taught and retain that information. That said, summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed because it allows for a more positve and creative atmosphere, improved scheduling, and higher pass rates.\n \n Virtually nobody wants to spend their summer doing classwork and projects. However, if the projects were both educational and entertaining, then summer would be that much more enjoyable. It would also allow the content to soak in much better. For instance, say a student wanted to to a project on auto mechanics. With a teacher designed rubric, the would want the project to be somewhat generc in its presentation. On the flip side of that, if the rubric was composed by students, that student now has a variety of options as far as presentation. Creativity and individudality are things that schools should integrate into their cirriculum.\n \n Also, if projects were student based, then the due dates would be rather reasoable. intstead of having to worry about one big poject, student could decide to break the project up into shorter, more managable dates. It would also allow for a more balanced schedule in general.\n \n Some people say that if the old rubric works, then keep on using it. They have been working for years now, so why change it; because students are sick and tired of repititon. Doing the same thing over and over for an extended amount of time is not good. It starts to blur the summers together, to the point where someone will not remember what they did because of the summers being so similar. If projects are mandatory over the summer, schools should make them enjoyable and worth the students' time. That way they undestand the material and they pass that class.\n \n With that being said, student designed projects are the much better route. With students being able to choose the subject and presentation style of the project, it will allow for creative juices to flow through everyones' minds and really intrigue the students. It would also allow for better time management on the development of said project.

      "How would you like to spend your summer? A teacher controlling your summer or you controlling your own summer? If some schools require students to do projects during their summer break, then these projects should be student designed. There are plenty of reasons why these projects should be student designed. First reason is since students are taking their break time to do school work then students should be able to design they own project. Second reason is if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. Third reason is students will take a break from school subjects and be able to design their own project.\n \n First, students are taking their own break time to do school projects, then they should be able to design their own projects. For example, if a student is going on vacation for 80 days and summer break is 78 days then this means he wont have that enough time to complete his assigned project. If its an assigned project then this takes time, you have to do researches. But if the project is self designed then the student can possibly finish the project in within 2-4 hours since it is self designed.\n \n Secondly, if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. For example, it is up to students if they want to complete the project in 1 or 2 months. They can take their own time and go on their own phase. Unlike if its teacher assigned, then this means there is most likely a due date assigned by the teacher.\n \n Lastly, if the project is student designed then students will take a break from school subjects and be able to designÂ theirÂ own project. For example, school subjects can be stressful at times. A lot of students do not like social studies. If the project is about social studies then students will get frustrated. So if the project is student designed then the student can do the project based on any topic they feel comfortable doing.\n \n In conclusion, these are my three reasons why the school projects should be student designed, since students are taking their break time to do school work then students should be able to design they own project. Another reason is if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. Last reason is students will take a break from school subjects and be able to design their own project.Â",

      "Student-designed projects are great, they persuade students to be more unique and creative on their project. There is an ongoing debate over whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are better, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Students are more creative than teachers. For example, I like to add more color and pictures to my project. When students work on project by their selves they tend to understand it better because there is no pressure on them. Furthermore, no one is telling the students what to read orÂ write on their project. When a student designs there own project it looks easier to them, and it also builds their confidence up. Another reason summer projects should be student-designed is because they better the student skills. For example, when I go off too college the projects will be easier to me because ImÂ already experienced, also if i was to do a presentation I would know what certain points I want to say, and what parts I would like to start from.\n \n There additional reasons why a student-designed summer project is more beneficial. Students can show the project to their friends and family, and that would help because if the student is wrong on some parts of the project they have people around that can correct them. However, when students show their project to their friends and family that can help better the student presentation and social skills. Due to the summer being a break from school, students have a lot of time to work on the project. For example, no one is rushing the student, therefore, the student can add extra work. The summer gives the students a lot of time to be more unique. Also, summer projects that are student-designed are better because the teacher may want the students to turn the project in earlier than expected. Another additional reason is that student-designed projects may be easier, because the student might not understand how the teacher designed it, or may not understand the instructions. For example, if summer already started and the student did not understand the teacher instructions, the student can ask the teacher to email the instructions to them.\n \n Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed. During the summer student-designed projects are best because they better student's skills, student have a lot of time to work on the project, and students can understand the project better. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are best, but this is not true.

    Essay:
      "Summer is the time of year students get to relax from going to school for 10 months. Though many people think it is unfair to give them out, projects can be administered in the summer. Regardless, if projects are given out during the summer, students should be given the option to create their own projects. Student-designed projects allow students to think independently, give motivationÂ to do the project, and allow the student to express themselves personally.\n \n While teachers do an impeccable job teaching, a teacher-designed project continues institutionalized learning. Projects that allow students to construct them make room for independent thinking. Independent thinking has major benefits such as better responses in class, because students absorb the information they learn for topics they liked researching, and a desire to learn outside of the class room. Projects enhances independent thinking by allowing the student decide what beneficial topic they want their project to be on and what time frame they want to create the project in.\n \n When a child is given the choice to do something on their own, a better outcome is seen. For instance, a child who is given a choice for what to eat for dinner is more likely to eat all of their food versus a child who is not given the choice. The same thing applies to a student and their project. Because students will be allowed to choose what to do their summer project on, they are more likely to complete the project. Student-designed projects also increases the effort put into the project. When a student is doing a project that they like, they are more likely to put in more effort versus a project that has been chosen for them to do over the time where a student is supposed to be having fun.\n \n Teacher-designed projects are extremely general. They do not adhere to the feelings of specific students. On top of that, teacher-designed projects are like the same projects administered throughout the year which demolishes a creative experience. Students who create their own projects get to express themselves. Students express themselves by choosing projects which mean something to them whether it is short story to a diorama of the solar system. An example of this is the Personal Project which is distributed the last year of the IBMYP program. Students are given the choice of a topic to talk about and present is. Many students were motivated to do the project and present it because they were allowed to express what was important to them.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed projects are more beneficial to one than a teacher-designed project. Creating one's own project allows independent thinking, which formulates a desire to learn without the push of a teacher. Additional reasons students should be allowed to choose their projects is because it increases motivation by making them want to complete a project they enjoy and because they can express their feelings through a personal connection with the project they are completing.",

      "Summer is the best time of the year for most of the students; it is the season that brings them joy and memories. But, without an organized summer plan, the students are very likely to forget what they have learned in the school year. Because of that, some education systems suggest summer projects for students to practice lessons during their break. However, these assignments that are designed by teachers seem to be unreasonable overload and can ruin the summer vacation that the students have been waiting for. Therefore, students and teachers will both be beneficial in learning and teaching if the lessons are well-designed. Although some may say that teacher-designed projects will consist of more important lessons, those that are designed by the students will surely be effective due to its interesting topics and reasonable schedule.\n \n Students will be more motivated if the topics come from their fields of interest. With these lessons, there will be less delay for students to work. They will explore new lessons that will later be helpful in their future careers; they would be no longer summer projects but are life lessons. For instance, in Generic_School, yearly, there are Capstone topics for students to research a topic of their own interest. There are still requirements that the topics need to meet in order to assure that students will learn new facts from their research; but, the lessons' topics are designed by the students. Because of the new learning structure, more students were involved in the projects which resulted in interesting ideas. These projects let the students to express themselves through learning. Another example, summer field tripsÂ nowadays are mostly created by students, and they are being applied to new lessons more due to their effectiveness in teaching. Letting the students to design the experiences of the lessons means letting they create their own memories of the lessons which will last longer than that of traditional methods. Being able to explore their fields of interest motivates the students, rather than compels them to learn.\n \n Beside having a break and doing school's projects, students should have time for other activities. These activities are the main part of the summer vacation. But, it would be impossible for them to distress and try these new activities if there isn't any time. Junior rising students seem to not have access to summer break due to the overload works in preparingÂ for the SAT and some of the school summer projects. Therefore, if the summer goes on with unreasonable loads of lessons and practices that are needed to be done, there would be lack of access for them to other activities. Summer is also the time for students to explore interesting future careers through internship and jobs opportunities. Consequently, looking at the bigger picture, if a student busy with the summer works from school, he or she will be lost in choosing interesting fields in the future due to their lack of experiences. That says, it is important for students to have time to access new activities that will determine their future.\n \n However, there are people who believe that summer projects that are made by students will not cover enough important information, thus teacher-designed projects are the perfect choice. It is true that important lessons must be covered, but that only should be done during the school year, not during the summer break. Doing so in the summer will distress students even more due to their lack ofÂ free time. If the pressure on students keep gaining, mental diseases like depression and mood changes will appear. There are many students in Generic_School and high schools around the world have gotten mental disorders which origin is from school works. Therefore, the main component of the teaching system should be the effectiveness of the lessons, not the amount lessons that are being taught. This is a major cons of the current education system and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible. And the only ones who can truly understand the problem are the students. Thus the student's opinions towards the structure of the school's system are very important.\n \n Projects and lessons should be designed by the students to guarantee the quality of the lessons. Through interesting topics,students will be more motivated to learn and explore new lessons. They will also have time for new activities, which will eventually help them in life. And more importantly, students will be able to avoid mental diseases, depression, etc; therefore, it creates a healthy generation of young adults. Overall, summer projects that are provided by schools should be created from the opinion and interest of students.",

      "Doing Summer Projects the Right Way\n \n At many high schools, a massive controversy is in the making. As the summer is right around the corner, students are getting prepared for their summer projects. These summer projects are in place to make sure the students never stop learning, and to make sure they are prepared for next year's class. The problem is if these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful.\n \n The first reason why the summer projects should be student-designed is because they are easier to plan into the students' busy schedule. Everyone can agree that the summer time is went students are the busiest. Many go on vacations to foreign nations, visit families in other states, and the list goes on forever. By making the the projects student-designed, it gives the students the ability to look at what they got planned for the summer. The students then can make their projects fit around their schedule. If the project was teacher-designed, then the teacher would not know how to make it where it fits the busy schedules of the students. Therefore, these examples prove that it is better to have projects student-designed.\n \n The second reason why it would be better to have student-designed projects is that it benefits the students more in several ways. Every student has a unique way of learning. Some students learn by listening. Others learn by using their eyes or by touch. By making these projects student-designed, the students can make them to where they can learn the most. An example would be if a visual learner had to make a project on the civil war, then he or she would make a presentation or anything that requires the eyes' engagement, helping them in the long run. If the project is teacher-designed, then the project will be made where it only benefits a small portion of the class. In conclusion, this shows that it benefits the students more to have student-designed projects.\n \n The third reason why it would be beneficial for the students to have student-designed projects is because it is less stressful. by making the projects student-designed, the students know what they are getting into before the summer even begins. If the projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers might overload the students with a bunch of work thinking that it would be the best for the students. Students may have other projects to do for other classes, and this would make it hard for the students to put their best effort into the projects. Students may also have stress from problems not relating to school. An example would be a student who need to work over the summer to help pay the bills. He or she would prefer a project that is student-designed because it takes away that stress that would be with a teacher-designed project. Therefore, it would be a positive impact if the students got student-designed projects.\n \n Many argue that teacher-designed projects would be better for the students. People claim that the teachers know their students well enough, that the students may design projects that are horribly made, or that teachers should have control over how the students learn. It might be true that teachers know their students really well, but the only person who knows the students the best are themselves. For the argument that projects will be horribly made, can be easily solved by having an outline which the students follow. They then make a project that follows that outline while making it their own way. These problems are also easily solved with the proof and evidence listed above, and it is clear that student-designed projects are ultimately better for the students.\n \n In conclusion, because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful, summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. Teacher-designed projects hurt the students learning ability while student-designed projects help it. Now ask yourself if your children are learning to the best of their ability over the summer. Ask them if their summer projects are student-designed or teacher-designed. If they say that they have teacher-designed projects, make sure that problem is addressed knowing that it does not benefit your children in any way.Â",

      "While summer break gives kids a chance to relax at the beach, It can also forgot what they have learned in school. The problem with summer break is that students are more likely to not focus on other opportunities to learn and forgot about what they learned during the school year. If it were to stay like this, then kids could be unprepared for colleges or other schools they want to go to in the future. To resolve this, some schools assign students a project to complete so they can continue earning over the break. However, there are two sides saying that the projects should be student-based or teacher-based. Schools should require students to make student-designed projects because it helps them show their creativity, learn new things during break, and work on their thinking skills.\n \n Some people argue that student-designed projects would not be beneficial because students would have trouble trying to come up with a good idea for their project. There are a few students that struggle with projects because they have to follow a set of rules to complete so they could get a good grade, but some ignore these rules or do not follow the exact instructions their teacher said and get a bad grade on the project. If the projects were teacher-designed, then students can follow how to do the project correctly and lean the information that the teacher wants. While this may be true, it can also help students on their thinking skills.\n \n Students with critical thinking skills are more likely to do better in school. Thinking skills have a positive effect on students because it helps them solve problems efficiently and new techniques that will help them in school. For example, a student completes a teacher-designed project but does not learn much information. Since he did exactly what the teacher wanted, he was not able to research information by himself, which would have helped him develop skills for the future. If the project the student made was student-designed, then he would have been able to learn how to research information and learn new things. This would also help many students to learn during break.\n \n Learning during summer break is good because it make sure students never forget what they learned from the school year. Summer break is good for students to take a break, but all the information they learned during the school yearÂ would be a waste. When they go back to school after summer break, then they would have no clue about what they learned, which is a problem because some of their classes might be similar to what they took last year. Giving students a project that is based on their own work would help out on their learning capabilities.\n \n Creativity is important for students because it shows what ideas they can come up with. Some students show their creativity by taking an art class, which helps them not only learn about art, but about new skills that will help them in the future. Teacher-designed projects may help students learn, but it will not help them reach their potential. Student-designed projects make students able to express their creativity and what they have learned in an interesting way.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed projects are the best way for students to learn during break. It helps them develop new thinking skills that would help them in future classes. Students can not only learn about new things during break, but also remember the information they learned during the school year. It also helps them show their creativity, which can motivate them to learn more. Schools should require students to complete student-designed projects during summer break. Â Â Â",

      "The policy of some schools requiring students to complete summer projects allows students to continue learning and challenging themselves academically when school is out of session. In order to encourage students to develop their creative and organizational skills, these summer projects should be designed by the students themselves. With the freedom of designing their own projects, students are also better able explore their own intellectual interests.\n \n Students must apply their creative skills when they are given autonomy in designing their assignments. My past history teacher assigned a project in which students were to select any event in history and present it through any medium. The students used creativity in crafting dioramas, drawing on large posters, constructing websites, and even conveying information through theatrical performances. The grading structure was based on how much effort was apparently put into each project, and this motivated students to work hard and make their projects unique. Students have the liberty and incentive to express their interests creatively if they design their own projects.\n \n Students can hone their organizational skills by structuring a project without a teacher's strict guidelines. Although guidelines are arguably necessary to any graded assignment, a teacher should create guidelines based on creativity and display of knowledge rather than conformity. In a student-based project, organizational skills beneficial to academic success are engaged, such as deciding on a main idea, providing evidence and examples, using pictures or diagrams for clarity, and practicing presentation techniques. In math class last year, I was assigned a project in which the only requirement was to explain a mathematical concept. Despite not having any background knowledge about website creation, I decided to make a website. I learned how to insert links and tabs dedicated to different mathematical topics. This experience taught me how to organize information into digital form. The ability to independently design an assignment is educational in that it develops students' ability to organize information in a clear, methodical way.\n \n Students will have the freedom to learn about and pursue their interests if they design their own projects. A teacher might have to restrict a project to a specific theme or subject, such as Medieval Europe. However, providing students some flexibility within a subject to work on the aspect that they feel most passionate about will lead to more enthusiasm. For example, my ecology teacher assigned students a research project on biomes. I was extremely curious about the tundraÂ but less so about the grasslands. Unfortunately, I had to research the grasslandsÂ instead of the tundra. I was largely apathetic about the subject, and although I learned some new facts, I believe doing a project on the tundra would have been a more educational experience for me. A student-designed project allows students to nurture their curiosity while completing academic work.\n \n By allowing students to design their own projects, students are less restricted by guidelines and are thus further enabled to develop their creative and organizational skills. Students are also able to learn about subjects that they already find interesting and worthy of further research, and will therefore be more enthusiastic about the assignment.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Have you ever found yourself being bored when doing a project? Have you found it pointless because you get the horrible feeling that you are not learning? It could be because it was designed by your teacher. Many schools, but not all, require students to complete summer projects in order to get them ready for the upcoming information in those upcoming classes. Many of those projects are teacher designed which various students tend to dislike because of the singular, required format. For example, many projects require students to only draw pictures, only write essays, or only build structures related to the certain topic. Many of these students tend to lack the motivation to complete those tasks because they feel uncomfortable doing an action they are inexperienced with. Even though teacher designed summer projects tend to broaden the student's skills by giving them tasks they are somewhat uncomfortable with, it is better for projects to be student designed so students can strengthen their confident skills, learn at their own pace, and have fun while efficiently studying the topic.\n \n Student designed projects give students the choice to pick a format they feel comfortable with. This choice gives the student confidence in their ability to complete the project and strengthens a particular skill in use. For example, Generic_Name, my niece, decided to do drawings for her summer reading project last year. She would say that drawing her own version of the characters from her favorite book,\n \n Diary of the Wimpy Kid , would helped her visualize the story in her own way so she could visualize effectively when reading books without pictures to guide her. When she completed her task, she felt so confident in her work and even said, \"I'm going to do so good on this project. I know my teacher is going to love it.\" Because of this, it was noticeable that she obviously felt confident in her outstanding drawings. She even became a better drawer from it. She turned in her project and got an astounding grade on it. Overall, the experience she had with the project was very rewarding for her because she got a chance to showcase her confident drawings and had the productive opportunity to build on the skill she loved.\n \n Student designed summer projects give students the ability to learn at their own pace while ultimately having fun. For example, two years ago, my former World History teacher, Mr Generic_Name, had us do a project over the summer about the most important events in world history. Fortunately, he gave the opportunity to choose our own format for the project. Luckily for my friend Generic_Name, he decided to complete the project in the form of a song, considering he was very musically talented. Over the summer he would plan when to work on it that best fit his schedule so he wouldn't be stressed to finish the song. He researched about the effects of World War II and finished his song in no time. He stated that it was one of the best projects he had ever completed because for the first time, he felt like he actually learned something while doing an activity that he loved and had fun with. This clearly shows the effects of giving students a choice in designing their own projects for the best learning experience.\n \n Some may argue that teacher designed summer projects give students a chance to broaden and strengthen skills students are uncomfortable with, however, students don't learn that way. For example, this year in my AP Economics class, a peer of mine, Generic_Name, said she didn't understand the point of the summer project, which was to pick a book about economics, she chose the book\n \n Freakonmics , and write an essay on how economic concepts apply to everyday life. This is also considering that essay writing is not her specialty. She loudly complained about how boring the project was and how it was extremely time consuming. She even stated she got nothing out of it. Because she didn't have fun, she didn't learn anything and was furious by this outcome. This undoubtedly shows that teacher designed projects make students feel like they don't learn anything and overall, make them feel bitter about the subject.\n \n Overall, teacher designed projects don't give the students an efficient way of learning. Some students may find the project uninteresting and because of this, they may not learn the helpful information needed to help them with their classes. However, if teachers do include this option to student within the projects, it could give students the possibility of having fun and actually learning while they are strengthening skills they feel confident in. All teachers want is for their students to learn in an efficient manner in order to succeed, but that outcome won't be possible if teachers give out projects that don't include student decision making. If teachers want to achieve this outcome, they should give student different options to format their project in order for them to learn in the most efficient way so they can ultimately succeed academically and in the future.",

Some believe that these projects should be desinged by students to offer freedom exploration, but teacher desinged projects give structure, regulatoin ,and garuntee if students are learning.\n \n One of the best things a teacher desinged project brings is structure. A study from The Universty of South Virgina states that students are three times as likly to do work if its in a structured enviorment.

      "Do students know that there are schools debating on whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects are required by some schools to help ensure student's continue learning in the summer. Through evaluating the different arguments, student-designed summer projects are more beneficial compared to teacher-designed ones because it allows students to chose topics they are interested in and have the freedom to creatively complete the summer project; therefore,students are learning through their summer break.\n \n Having student-designed projects will allow students to chose topics they are interested in, which would captivate and motivate the students to want to complete the summer project. During the summer, many students don't find motivation to do any school work until last minute,in order to ensure they are spending a fun summer vacation. If summer projects allowed to the students to chose topics that interest them, it would help motivate them because the topic is something they like or are curious about. Consequently, students won't want to do a project on something that is boring to them because it leads the students make one of the following decisions: do the project last minute and put minimal effort or not complete the project at all. Summer projects are to ensure that students continue learning over their break; however, students won't be learning when they decide the project is uninteresting, then proceed to make the decision to put minimal effort into the project or not complete the project at all. So, are the students really learning at the end of the day? Putting minimal effort won't challenge or ensure the students are learning and neither is not completing the project. With all this in mind, student-designed projects would help with these issues. For instance, if a student has to complete a summer project about the American Revolution, but the American Civil War is what really interests them with a passion, wouldn't it be beneficial for the student and the teacher, for the student to do the project on the American Civil War because the project would be done at the student's best abilities? When students have the liberty to chose their own projects, like topics as it was discussed previously, this motivates and captivates the student's attention and want to complete the project; therefore, the students are learning over the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects allows the students to have the freedom to be creative and complete the project in a way they chose. Having creative freedom will cause the students to find the summer projects fun and will want to complete them. Additionally, when students can challenge themselves through this process because sometimes they will use new resources or try something new when completing their summer projects. For instance, if a student has to do a project on an assigned book for their English class, the student can decide to produce a video or create an infrographic, instead of a boring, old PowerPoint. The students can learn through this process because they are putting effort into the projects and making them more appealing to the teachers as well as other students, if they have to present. Moreover, students will have fun completing this project, helping ensure that the students will complete the project with lots of effort put into it, which leads to the students learning and students enjoying the process. During the student's summer break, they often tend to try and find school boring during it; however, the creative freedom given to accomplish their summer projects helps motivate them to complete them.\n \n On the other hard, others say that summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know best and create an expectation forÂ their students, which is partly true, however, not always. This is flawed in some ways because the projects that are teacher-designed are often categorized as boring because the students freedoms are often limited and don't show their full potential. If students had the ability to show their full potential in completing the project, the teachers will know exactly where they stand educationally in that subject. Another argument for teacher-designed projects is that it is easier on the teacher's side to grade the projects and create a rubric when assessing students. However, this is not a good argument since the teacher's job is to grade and making a rubric for student-designed projects shouldn't be that difficult. For example, if a student does a well produced video on Africa for their geography class with special effects and music that includes accurate information and meet teacher's basic requirements, that is much better than a boring PowerPoint; and the student was continue to learn during the summer about Africa and how to produce a video. In addition, to be reminded, summer projects are to ensure that students are learning during their break; however, with teacher-designed projects,that can never fully be ensured when many students barely put any effort in them or not do it at all. Therefore, teacher-designed projects ,majority of the time, have limited freedom for students and cause students to become uninterested in doing them, so they are not learning.\n \n Summer projects should be fun for the students, so student-designed projects allows the students to freely do as they chose with the project and have fun with it. During the summer, students don't find motivation to do any school work as they are exhausted by the finished school year; however, if the summer projects were fun for them, students will find motivation to complete them and put effort into them. As mentioned before, students will not perform good on their summer projects if they are boring, which is commonly found in teacher-designed projects. Furthermore, student-designed projects helps ensure the students ability to learn in the summer; that being the goal of summer projects.Â",

      "Many students would want to come up with their own thoughts on a summer project to have the motivation to complete the project, make sure the topic they choose is interesting to them, and know exactly what their topic is about. I believe that for students to complete a summer project, that the students should be the designers of the projects. If teachers are to design the summer projects will the students be as involved? I think that if the projects are student-designed that they will be in involved and will have the courage to work on the projects they designed. Students today are going to be more encouraged to finished and get done something they came up with. For example students don't like when teachers choose their project topics, research paper topics or group partners, because they would rather choose themselves. Also students that know their topic are going to be more aware. Student-designed projects are coming from the students therefore, students are going to know all aspects and components. Not all students stay on track with projects however, if it's something they designed students can't say they were not aware of or \"didn't know what to do\". As well as choosing something interesting to grade age kids. Most commonly students do not interact or don't want to interact with subjects or topics that don't interest them. Keeping their attention will attract them to finish. Many topics would not satisfy all variety of students so in order to keep all students interested and willing to do a summer project, letting summer projects be student-designed is a brilliant idea.\n \n However since students would be the designers and come up wih all the thoughts and ideas, teachers would need to revise their project thoughts and make sure all project topics are project efficient. Having students design and build onto their thoughts could save teachers from having to come up with ideas, help new ideas, and new flow from one another.",

      "Are projects over the summer in fact needed for do they just cause misery for students?\n \n More commonly now in high school, teachers assign projects to students over the summer. These projects are called \"summer projects.\" The projects are given to the students to retain and expand upon their learning over the summer. Teachers are the force behind the projects with no saying coming from the students; however, this is how it should be. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it provides for the students to be prepared for the next school year and continues the development of the brain.\n \n Summer projects are given to make sure that students are ready for the year ahead of them. Teachers always have to follow the curriculumÂ with their teaching and assignments, meaning that they will always give what is needed to the students. If a student is partaking in a difficult class their next school year, teachers will commonly assign a summer project. This summer project will follow exactly what the curriculum says is necessary. In doing this, the teacher is giving exactly what the student needs to be prepared for the next school year. This past summer, I was given an optional summer assignment that was given to all students going into pre-calculus. The assignment was thought up and provided by a teacher that knows what the course entails. This summer assignment, that I completed, gave me the proper ingredients to be prepared for the year of the class ahead of me. I am glad now that I finished that project, because the teacher that designed it knew exactly what I needed to know in order to succeed in the class.\n \n The human brain continues to develop until the age of twenty five, and it is important to sustain this growth throughout that time with proper projects provided by teachers. At age twenty five, the human brain finally stops developing and it becomes more difficult for it to learn and adapt to it's surroundings. This is why it is vital to take great care of and continuously develop the brain in the right way throughout these years. With teacher-designed summer projects it is certain that the brain will nurtured and brought up the right academic way. Teachers assign material that is important to know as a developing young adult. These teachers commonly also have experience from their years of teaching and know in what way students should be brought up in order to be successful. With the correct teacher designed summer project students are properly developed in order to achieve their goals, however if designed by the students themselves, this caring thought will not be in mind.\n \n Students can't be left to be independent in these important projects. Although there is the idea that it is important for students to also develop individually in moments instead of a curriculum based way, this is not true for summer projects. Students don't fully know what the next course entails; whereas, teachers do know. Students can create projects that do not allow for them to be prepared for the year, or projects that cover the wrong part of their next course. This individuality also creates a divide in the knowledge of the students entering their next year, creating a difficult circumstance for the teacher of said class. With the divide in knowledge the teacher would have to compensate and reteach certain parts that should have already been covered and reviewed in the summer project. Overall, this student individuality creates many causes in concern over whetherÂ the student is ready for their year of a difficult class.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects because it ensures the preparedness of the students and continues the vital development of the young brain in the right direction. Teachers follow the curriculum, and will do the same in their assigned summer projects. This curriculum based activity is exactly what students need to be prepared for their classes. These teacher based assignments also make sure that the brain, which isn't fully developed until the age of twenty five is properly brought up. This brain developed is important to bring up a well rounded academic young adult. Moreover, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is what students need.",

    Essay:
      "Many students dread their summer projects and procrastinate what is intended to be a three month long project or book till mere hours before the bell rings on their first day back. However, the stereotypical teenager angst that resents the idea of summer homework can be sternly challenged due to the great benefit for students working their brains during their time off. Some say that summer projects would be more enjoyable and valuable to students if they were designed by their peers instead of teachers. I disagree and believe that the teacher of a particular course can give the best synopsis to their class and set straight the expectations and course loadÂ through the summer assignment. Summer projects are a great tool to keep students' brains stimulated over the break, and they should be teacher designed in order to provide students with a strong background on a topic that will be further discussed during the school year, help to prepare students for the style of a teacher that they may be unfamiliar with, and allows the student to view a glimpse of the rigor and expectations that accompany a particular course.\n \n Summer projects are beneficial when they provide the opportunity for the student to learn more about a topic that will be discussed in their class during the year. It is essential that the students are given the opportunity to establish a strong framework that they can later build on with the help of their peers and teachers. Because this background is so vitally important I believe that it is the most beneficial for the summer project that will guide the student on their quest for more knowledge is designed by the teacher who knows exactly what topics will be covered in their class and what would be in the utmost importance to get an early understanding on. During the summer before Freshmen year my English class required a summer assignment on the Odyssey be completed. At first I was bummed out because I did not want to spend my summer doing homework, however it proved to be wildly beneficial and I enjoyed it. The summer assignment was designed by my English teacher and asked us the look more into specific characters and stories that she knew we would have a test on shortly after returning to school. Because the I completedÂ the assignment that my teacher crafted with care, I was beyond prepared for our test on the Odyssey and all in class discussions on the matter.\n \n Teachers even within the same discipline can have drastically different teaching styles, which is another reason why I believe that summer assignments should be curated by the teacher. A summer assignment made by that teacher should provide a glimpse into that particular teacher's style and allows the student to see early on what their new teacher places emphasis on while grading. During a student's schooling career it is unlikely that they will ever encounter a teacher whos style is identical to another teacher that they have had which is why it is of the utmost importance that students are allowed the opportunity to get to know their knew teacher and what the teacher will expect of their class before they even step foot in their classroom. For example my Freshmen and Sophomore year history teachers both were amazing history teachers but my individual learning preferences meshed much better with one of them. The different styles of teaching work better for different students depending on how they best learn, but it is important for the student to get a glimpse of their new teacher through the summer assignment.\n \n Summer assignments should also reflect the rigor of their corresponding course while setting forth the expectations that the teacher will have for their students in the class. Students gaining a general idea on how hard a particular class will be is extremely valuable if done so over the summer because then that allows for time at the beginning of the school year for the student to potentially switch to a different difficulty level if so desired. Because the summer assignment could potentially determine if the student drops the class to move levels it is integralÂ that the assignment be as class to the demand and standard of the actual class as possible. For this reason I believe that the teacher would be able to give the student a better accurate impression of the rigor of their class than a fellow student could give their peer. For example a summer assignment for AP U.S. History would be a great way for the teacher to open their future students horizon on the course and give an idea on how much homework that should be expected, the requirements for analyticalÂ pieces of writing like a data based question, and the overall expectations of the class.\n \n Summer assignments are a great way to get students' brains moving over the long break and can be beneficial in many different ways. These benefits like increased background knowledge and exposure to new teaching styles are hinged upon weather or not the assignment is made by students or teachers. Summer assignments should be teacher designed because it shows the student the rigor of the course, enables students to gain a strong background on subjects that will be discussed during the year, and helps to expose students to the style of their new teacher.",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer, one of the greatest times in a high school students life. A chance to take a break from school and sit back and relax in the warm summer heat. There are many ways teachers try to find a way for students to be able to keep up some of the things they learned during the break, one of the ways is assigning projects, should these projects be teacher designed or student designed? In my opinion they should be student designed. There are many reasons why but there are three reasons that really stand out to me .Students will find a fun and inspiring way to make a project, students also know what its like to be a teenager in the summer and not only doing the project but designing the project will help the student learn.\n \n Firstly, students know what it's like to be a teenager in the summer. Just the thought of the warm sun, cool water and late nights gives me chills down my spine. Just the idea of summer gives everyone a light happy feeling in their stomachs. Summer is a time for freedom, and many students hate the idea of the freedom taken away by a project a teacher gave them, which makes them not want to do that project at all. If students were to make the project they would think about what they do in the summer and how the summer makes them feel. They would most likely design a project that kids would do because they have an idea of an teenage life in the summer.\n \n Secondly, Designing the project will also be beneficial for the students to learn. They will learn how to design something and also, while designing the project they will learn more about the information inside the project. The students that usually do better in classes are ones that when they get it and understand what to do, they then teach it to someone else in the class that is struggling on it more. That is basically the same concept for students giving the ability to design this summer project.\n \n Lastly, in my opinion I believe students are more creative than teachers, especially when they are given a teachers task. I believe that when designing the project, the students will make the project fun and inspiring along with educational. I believe that students will make a project so fun an interesting that in the summer when kids sit down and do their project they won't even realize they are doing an project. Earlier this year my teacher gave my class a project over Christmas break that students made the year before. She also gave us a project for over Thanksgiving break that she made. The difference between the two projects was unbelievable. The one over Christmas break I actually wanted to do, while the one over Thanksgiving break I did not want to do at all. The one over Christmas break was fun and I actually did that one to my full abilities, and learned quite a bit doing it . Other than the one over Thanksgiving break where I just half did it and barley learned anything. I also saw a diffrence of people turning in their project. The one over Christmas a majority of the class did it, while the one over Thanksgiving break just a few people did it.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that students designing the project over the summer will cause more productivity in the projects getting done, more students will keep up their education in the summer and students who get to design the project will learn so much just from designing it.",

      'Summer break, the most favored break out of them all, mainly because, it is the most extensive break of the school year, and there are a lot of activities to do, and places to see over the long summer break which everyone enjoys. Summer break is also a good way to forget about all the stressful things that happened during the school year, like having a lot of homework, and not being able to complete it on time, and other things. Over summer though, there is no homework, so nobody has to worry or stress about having to do it. However, some schools actually do give out homework over summer in the form of projects, and the reason for this is so students can continue learning even over their summer break, but should these projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Well, most projects during the school year are teacher designed already, but over summer they should probably be student-designed projects and the reason why is because, students can actually do something they are interested in for the project and not something that they most likely do not want to do.\n \n First of all, summer projects are a good way of ensuring that the students do learn something, but a student-designed project would ensure that the student would learn something that they would actually be interested in, too many times in school students are pushed to do something, and learn something, that they dont have any interest in. If the projects were student-designed, students might even want to do them over the summer. For example, if a student had to do a summer project that was a student-designed project for history class, and this student was heavily passionate about taking photos, they could do a picture collage of all the historical sites they visited over the summer, the student does what they are passionate about like taking photos, and the teacher gets his historical project or a project of any subject for that matter. Student-designed projects offer more choices on how to do the project than teacher-designed projects, they also offer more freedom and this is good because then the students will enjoy the project and get a good grade out of it rather than doing something they consider as "boring" or "not fun", and most importantly they will learn things during their break which is the whole purpose of summer projects whether they are student-designed or teacher-designed.\n \n Secondly, Though some may argue that with teacher-designedÂ projects, students will learn more and will actually do their project, it can also be argued that the students will learn either way, with any method, in fact students might even retain the things they learned better with the student-designed projects, than with the teacher designed-projects because they did something they were actually interested in. Also, since they are doing something that they want and not something that they need to do for the project, the student-designed projects are more likely to have students successfully complete them rather than the teacher-designed projects, though in both cases they might have the same amount of students who actually complete them, since the students know that it is for a grade. Another benefit of the student-designed option, is that they are less stressful since the students get a say in their projects, and they will have more options to chose from with what they want to do for that specific project. Student-designed projects are beneficial to both the student, and the teacher, and while the same can be said about teacher-desgined projects, the students would memorize and maybe even learn more things with student-designed projects, and it could also be a more fun and less stressful way of doing a project and learning.\n \n In conclusion, I stand by my opinion that students that have projects over summer break, should have student-designed projects rather than teacher-desgined projects because, the students can learn something they want to learn, in contrast to learning things that they arent interested in, and though most of that information is vital and nessecary to the student\'s future lives, there are better ways to ensure they learn those nessecary skills, and student-designed projects are one of those ways. I believe that those student-designed projects will lead to students achiving a better grade in class, learning the vital school information, and learn something that they desire to learn.',

      "There are some schools that require students to complete a summer project to assure they're learning while they're on break. Usually, the teachers design what they want their students to do. Some people disagree with the idea of summer projects being teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows creativity, benefits the teacher, and students are more likely to do it.\n \n When students are able to design their own projects, students get to be as creative as they want. Every student is different and have their own ideas. These ideas shouldn't be limited to a boring project that everyone else is doing. This also shows individuality. They're able to express who they are in their projects. This allows their classmates get to know them.\n \n These projects can be very beneficial to teachers. It also allows their teacher get to know them as a person. Teachers work with many students everyday, and new students every year. By making these projects student-designed, the teacher will know what type of kids they'll have. This also allows teachers to get to know them as a student.

      "Throughout the school year, students are overwhelmed with mandatory classes and time-consuming activities. Today's students are more stressed than ever as they tried to keep up with their advanced classes and heavy workload. This often leaves students having to pick between their extracurricular and their school work, leaving them very little time to just be kids. Summer gives students the opportunity to relax and enjoy the world, but for many students summer assignments interfere. Allowing students to design their own summer assignments enables them to learn about something they are interested in all while continuing to emphasize the importance of learning in their daily lives.\n \n Students are given very little opportunity to take classes that appeal to them or that will benefit them in their future careers. Most high schools have a certain number of mandatory classes that must be taken to graduate and grant students only one or two electives. Giving students the ability to pick their own summer project lets them get the chance to explore a topic of their interest. A self-chosen project would feel less like a stressful job and more of an adventure. This would evoke passion in students and teachers will see better work in return. Additionally, students should not be limited to pick between certain topics, they should be able to choose anything from science to sports, and anll that falls inbetween. Introducing their own passions through a student-selected activity may even bring the joy of learning back after a school year full of stress.\n \n Schools often placed students in a box and present them with one way to learn. Standardize tests and their GPA start to define kids and throughout the school year, kids begin to loose interest in school and count down the days till summer. There is love of learning has been abandoned and each class drags on. Schools have the responsibility to engage their students and prepare them for life, a student-chosen summer project is a step in that direction. Schools that have started this have seen increased participation in the summer projects and more students are willing to learn throughout the school year.\n \n Consequently, schools must maintain some rules for their summer projects. Education is the most powerful tool a person can have and should be treated with such importance. Learning should be incorporated into your everyday and should not be placed on the back-burner during summer break. Schools must enforce a level of complexity to the project to ensure that the projects are of equal effort. For example, a student can not call watching television their passion. It is important to acknowledge all types of interests but giving students free range on a summer assignment could result in laziness or incomplete work. However, students who treat this project as a last minute event is more of a reflection on the student than the project itself. Nevertheless, schools must present some authority in assigning the project while still maintaining the idea of enabling students to explore their interests.\n \n Allowing students to select their own summer project is both beneficial to the students and the school. Teachers have all year to assign their own projects and summer is the perfect time for it be the students turn to explore their own passions and learn about an unknown topic. Although, initially schools will have to place some rules on the project the opportunity to bring the joys of learning back to kids is something that can not be pass up.Â",

My third opinion is if the students designs they're own summer project they might pick a project that might not help them. The summer projects should be design from a teacher not a student because the students won't know what their doing.\n \n The first reason why is because, Teachers has been working with they're students all year long.

This way the students won't have the same problems next year.\n \n The second reason why is because, Teacher will already know what to do. Teachers has been assigning projects for years, They will know what project will benefit his/hers students. If a student designs the project it might not benefit most students or it might not make any sense for other students. Also a student doesn't have the same experience from a teacher that has been working with students for years.\n \n The last reason why is because, a student will not know whats the best project for them selfÂ or won't take it serous.

      "Have you ever received the most boring Summer assignment from a teacher and waited till the last week to do it? Many would answer yes. Summer projects are designed to allow for a child to continue to grow cognitively, while away from a continuous study at school. However, many fail to consider that kids are still on Summer break, resulting in fun activities rather than working on a project due 3 months away. In order for Summer projects to succeed, they should be student-designed to ensure engagement within the project, allow them to grow in a field of interest, and give the students an opportunity to express themselves.\n \n Keeping students engaged in a Summer project is critical to the success of the assignments. A studentÂ is more likely to spend more time on a project that they are interest in, rather than completing required tasks that they don't want to do. Enacting student-designed projects allows for them to voice what they are likely to do that will keep them engaged in a learning activity. This allows the students to feel control over their Summer, and how they may want to incorporate learning into a fun growing experience. While they may voice their thoughts, they will also have a better understanding on what exactly to do for their project ahead of time keeping them engaged in whatever they need to accomplish. Providing a platform for students to express their ideas, leads to engagement and a product that succeeds the purpose.\n \n For many students, their engagement in an activity comes from the topic, allowing them to have freedom as to what they create, helps them further their mind. This also allows for fun because they are more engaged based on their topic choice. Many people say that they are prone to doing better on an assignment involving a topic of interest because they care more about the product. Student's who care about a topic will give you a product that means something to them, expressing their creativity and effort that they put into an assignment. Lastly, these projects are designed to cognitively grow and maintain a child's mind over break. Learning about themselves is one of the most important ways of doing that; by allowing them to design their own project and have freedom as to what they want to do, you are allowing an opportunity for them to find out what they are interested in and understand more about themselves.\n \n Finally, Summer is defined in a kid's mind to be a time of enjoyment and relaxation after a dwelling school year. With these Summer projects they should be associated with a similar thought. Student's designing their own project will allow for a creative outlook and give them an opportunity to create a better project than a poster board. Creativity proves to be effective in allowing for more growth than ever about how you may want to present what you learned over a break. Also when allowing a student to express creativity you are creating opportunity for them to incorporate something unique into their assignment which will further their engagement and growth.\n \n In all, Summer projects would be more effective and beneficial to student's if they were designed by student's themselves based on an increase of interest, opportunity to grow in a field of interest, and ability to incorporate a personable and creative outlook. Student's will feel empowered and confident in their assignment by self-designing an opportunity to grow themselves. Overall the result and product will be more detailed and purposeful when engaging a student in something they enjoy while allowing growth in their self as well as their minds.Â",

      "Every summer, many students are sent home with work to to over their summer break. Not only are these projects often very labor intensive, but they are also put together by teachers, The students don't have a say in the formation of the projects. These summer projects should be designed by the students themselves because they know their brains better that anybody else, they will be more likely to complete something that they put together, and summer is supposed to be a relaxing time, so easygoing projects that are student-made could help keep students away from stress in the summer.\n \n Every student learns differently, so designing a project to fit their needs and their learning style would not only help them complete the project, but it would also help students learn more. For example, if one student in a class is a visual learner, and the other is an auditory learner, the visual learner will have an advantage on a project that is assigned ever summer and made out of poster board and pictures. This will also cause the visual learner to obtain information on the project more easily, while the auditory learner could gradually fall behind in school every summer. Even if a teacher took a poll to see what kind of learner each student thought themselves to be, there would not be one learning type that would be unanimous throughout a classroom or a school. This is a major obstacle that comes with distributing the same teacher-designed project to every student as a summer assignment.\n \n There are very few students around the globe who enjoy doing homework given to them by their teachers, but what if the students were the architects behind the masterpieces of homework and projects? Students, knowing that they put the powerpoint, poster, or worksheet together, might be more than motivated to complete the assignment. People may argue that a student being able to design their own assignment might not work out beautifully because they may know things that are usually not given to them on a normal worksheet. However, students will quickly realize that what is easiest for them is not enough, and they will need to challenge themselves throughout these assignments to make sure that they are ready for the school year that is to come. Also, students would not be given free reign to do anything that they please, teachers would provide guidelines and rubrics to make sure that students are incorporating the correct information and at the right difficulty.\n \n Every student looks forward to summer as a time to take a break from school, have fun with their family and other companions, and to simply relax. Assigning rugged and stressful projects for students to complete over their few months of relaxation could result in building stress and anxiety, which can lead to depression and things much worse. If students were to design their own projects and know exactly what they need to do and when they need to do it, they may not need to stress a great deal about the amount of time they have and about how much it will take away from their summer. This will ensure that high school students are still being high schoolers and having fun with friends and family. Some teachers could argue that they will stress about any project that they are assinged, but they have to understand that students know what they enjoy doing, and what they do not enjoy doing. Therefore, students could tailor their projects to be fun and stress free.\n \n Students should be allowed to be the lead architect on the glorious building that is their summer assignment in order to make sure that they are completing work that keeps them away from stress and learning in the way that their brain knows how to learn. If students were able to design their own summer projects, a mass change in the way scholars learn could be coming, and it would be for the better.",

More over, Should teachers or students design these projects? Many people argue summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed; however, no one thinks about a student/teacher-designed project.\n \n Projects made by students and teachers can cover the relevant topics with creative ideas such as: phone projects, video game projects, and sports projects. This can create diversity amoungst all projects and help the student haveÂ an exciting experience. Now-in-days Students spend their daily lives on their phones, assigning a project on their phones would make it easier for the student to navigate and be comfortable with the environment their in. For example, a teacher could create a class account on social media and post or request projects during the summer, and because students are always on their phone, they should be able to complete the projects assigned. Motivating a student to stay on track can be quite difficult if the material is boring or uninteresting. A student and teacher collaboration can grasp both sides of the spectrum and pull thoughts, ideas, and examples and put them all in one to make a great project idea.\n \n Throughout my junior year in high school i've done many projects and essays in most of my classes and they've all been teacher-designed. The most freedom i've probably gotten is just picking which assigned topic i'd like to write about or do research on but thats pretty much it, I'm very limited. For example, in my second period my teacher assigns many essays on politics or current events. Not everyone is interested in those topics so some of the students my class dont take the time to research and just copy and paste information found on websites. This makes students lazy and in the end they dont learn anything, they only thing they've learned is a bad habit. A recommendation i could make to my teacher is have more variety, more options, or even maybe a topic more interesting to provide to his students.\n \n Another great teacher of mine, Generic_Name, has the most variety and is willing to work with a student. Although he assigns teacher-designed essays, we have the freedom to pick our topics and what we get to write about. He helps morph your ideas into complex thoughts to satisfy the writer and the rubric. Furthermore, helping the student to think deeper and be interested in doing their essay. The teacher having some flexibility allows the student to enjoy what they're doing and finish their task.\n \n All in all, students and teachers can be affected greatly if projects were student/teacher-designed. A collaboration between students and teachers can create a connection leading to a greater outcome and success. Teacher-designed projects can also create a stressful environment for the students, and allowing student ideas to flow into teacher-designed projects creates a healthy environment for students minds. Students and teachers can build off each otherÂ and have a great relationshipÂ because, \"\n \n great minds think alike .",

      "During the summer break some students may forget all about what they've learned. Schools are requiring students to complete projects during the summer to help them keep learning. Students should be able to chose what they would like to do for their project.\n \n Students look forward to their summer break because they dont have to do anything. Well teachers want them to continue learning during their break. If the kids were able to choose what they want to do on the project, they would actually do it unlike if the teachers chose a boring project. Kids are embellish and like to do their own thing.\n \n Also they get a new teacher every year. Their new teacher could expect more than the old teacher or grade it differently.\n \n If the teacher chose the project, the students might not do it because its boring or lame. If the student chose what the project is about then it's easier for the teacher to grade it and the students would enjoy it more. All the students would have different projects so it could be like a science fair and they get to judge whose project is the best.\n \n Students throughÂ out all ages are creative. Some love to draw,write,and record. This generation is all about phones. They could make a documentaryÂ or even a YouTube video about whats going on in the world. Doing projects they get to chose may excite some students and make them want to do it. They could also do their project based off how their summer went.\n \n Kids love to be independent and cant wait to grow up. Teachers may be hard on students and give them projects they struggle with. The students should be able to have the choice to chose, since the schools are requiring students to complete summer projects.",

      "Have you ever thought to yourself about how summer projects affect students? Some schools have started to require students to complete a summer project, Should the projects be student-led or teacher-led? The following reasons are why I believe summer projects should be student-led: It would allow the students to broaden their topic range, It would make sharing the projects more enjoyable, and It would allow students to reflect on their summer.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to choose the topic of their project would allow the students to talk about everything they did over the summer. This allows students to choose anything they did, from taking a peaceful vacation to skydiving over Generic_City. Students would be able to adventure and begin an amazing life that has so many roads to follow. Many students would benefit from the projects and would have many stories to tell.\n \n Another reason students would enjoy self-led projects is because giving the students freedom to share their projects with other classmates. Sharing the projects would give students many things to talk abou when they come back to school and see eachother. Students by sharing could teach new things about eachother such as what their hobbies are. With students sharing their projects it forms new bonds and create new friendships between many unlikely people. Sharing projects would bring people together more and overall be great for everyone, it gives students necessary life skills such as: public speaking, communication skills, and essentially confidence.\n \n Allowing students to conduct their projects would be beneficial to students becuase they would have time to sit down and think about all they did. The project itself isn't really about the actual project, It's about students thinking and knowing they made pretty awesome memories over the summer. The projects shouldn't be about school work such as math or a history project. It should be about the students and helping them do their best to live their young lives to the fullest. In the end the students would be out in the world making memories with people in their community, they would be making a difference in the world they could travel and help with disaster relief, students could make a change in this world and the next.\n \n While some people may say that teacher-led projects could be best. I believe they are wrong, Nothing could make student mental and physical health go up other than to actually give students the freedom to complete a project and show they made a difference over the summer. Making the difference wouldnt have to end when summer ends students could make changes year-round. In theory students starting to develop their own projects would lead to students just wanting to make a change and go adventure.Â",

      "Summer break is a time we enjoy cause get to spend more time with friends and family. Some people think that taking a break won't do them harm at but you maybe allowing others to get ahead of you in life. The time you have on a break should be spent wisely not goofing around. During summer kids tend to study less which in return lowers brain activity which is why the should have a summer project to keep them busy. This summer project should be chosen by the students of the class room.\n \n Teachers think students can't handle certain situation but who better to chose what the students can handle then them selfÂ for this project. When students are given the option to pick their project they will feel much more motivated to accomplish this assignment if they can choose what it is going to be about. This motivation will cause the students to work harder for their grade and strengthen the skills they already know or new ones need for this assignment. The students could come up with this summer project together so that everybody will feel equally involved want to do their best. The standard for the project should be high so be won't be able to show up with a barelyÂ worked on assignment and pass. This assignment or project should build on skills that have been used through out the class.\n \n When kids have summer projects they could use it as a opportunity to build on skills need for a future career or maybe not so strong at like time management or mathematics. This extra time spent on the project will result in a positive change in grades and thinking. The brain is like a muscle the more you work it the stronger it gets so just like a muscle the less exercise you give it the more softer and weaker it is. There is more to just improving your work ethic and increasing brain productivity when it come to doing projects over the summer. When a kid is working on a project they are less likely to do something that can get them involved in dangerous or life threaten events.\n \n When kids have less time to do things they will ultimately value their time more and start to make better decisions. This will lead to better planning in the future and time spent doing something productive. They will also start to think about how this summer project be able to help them in their future career options or college and branch out in try learning new skills to accomplish these task in life. When letting a teacher pick the summer project kids may not feel as motivated to do it or see it as stupid but, the teacher will strengthen their skills in that subject.\n \n The project will lead to a better use of time over summer for most kids. This assignment will keep the kids working on their skills. This may even help kids see this project in a better view of why they have to do this. Their summers will be ten times more productive then they were before. Learning is a key foundation in life ,and the more you learn the more likely your chances of being successful.",

      "Have you ever been assigned a project over a long break? Summer projects are a good way to continue the learning from the school year into the long break, but if not done right, it can lead to the students not trying or learning anything new. It's not very conventional, but if you are assigned the right thing, then it can be beneficial. I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because the projects should be beneficial to the individual student; not to a whole class that has different learning capacities. The students projects would be designed for specifically what they need clarification on from the previous school year. This should help the student gain knowledge of the project subject to help them succeed in the future school year. For example, if a student didn't understand human geography but was assigned a project in math, than it wouldn't help them gain knowledge for their upcoming school year; however, if a student didn't understand human geography and was assigned a human geography project, then it would help them succeed in the future. If the students designed their own summer projects then there would be a greater effect than the whole class doing the same subject project.\n \n Students tend to learn better when they're the creator of their project and subject guidelines. Personally, I tend to work better by myself, on a subject that I need to improve my knowledge on. This gives me motivation to learn the subject where I lack knowledge, to help benefit me for my upcoming tests or even class. I asked multiple other classmates about their stance on this, and they also agree that working on something you enjoy learning about while working alone is way more beneficial than a standard summer project. It could be argued that some students don't learn when they don't have guidelines. The weakness in that is if students are given the opportunity to design their own project, then they will be able to retain the information more easily.\n \n Allowing students to design their own summer projects would increase the creativity of the project. This would improve the experience of the student and the teacher. This improves the experience of the student because it allows them to learn and expand thier knowledge on something they like instead of a forced subject. In addition, this improves the experience for the teacher because they get to learn new things too. In addition, they won't be grading the same project for every individual person. Students that design their summer projects have the opportunity to captivate their teachers attention with an astonishing amount of information.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative. Summer projects should reflect a students knowledge on a subject, not forced work. The students projects would be designed for specifically what they need clarification on from the previous school year. This should help the student gain knowledge of the project subject to help them succeed in the future school year.

      "As a young girl summer projects had always taunted me. I've always hated that the summer projects were so hard that I can only answer 2 questions out of the 50 question packet. These packets made me feel like I wasn't smart enough , even thoughÂ they were there to help me. And the fact that if I were to complete the packet teachers wouldn't ask for it and that bugged me so much. Although some may believe otherwise struggling students , My friend's experience , and my own experience proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Struggling students proves that summer projects should be student-designed. Summer projects are here to help us and keep us learning .When a student struggles in that subject area where the project was given these students would struggle and then become discouraged to continue making them feel small. Student-designed summer projects would target the areas they struggle in to help them succeed. Some people may say that these type of students will still struggle with or without student-designed work . In some cases this may be the case but student designed work will target trouble factors but teacher-designed will through a whole curriculum at you.\n \n My friend's experience also proves that student-designed projects are the way to go. In the summer of 2019 my friend Generic_Name was given an Algebra 2 summer project packet to complete. Knowing that math isn't her strong suitÂ she still attempted the summer assignment. As she went along the packet the questions were getting harder and harder for her to complete. She had never seen questions like this before so she got discouraged. Out of 100 math questions she only completed 10. She was beaten. How was she as a junior to remember the math curriculum from freshman year. So she tried to use online resources to help her but she still couldn't understand. The packet was never completed. Some people may say she shouldv'e gotten a tutor, but not a lot of people can afford a tutor to help them.\n \n Lastly my own experience is why summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. As I said earlier teacher-designed packets made me feel like I wasn't smart enough and that they so hard that I can answer only 2 questions out of the 50 question packet. Teacher-designed packets are meant to introduce you to the curriculum for the upcoming year for that subject area. So that means harder problems. But student-designed packets are targeting problems areas and are helpful and designed to the student personally which means more understanding and helpful. Most of the time content that is understanding and shaped for that specific student's learning is what is best for them. I know that if a curriculum was shaped for me and how I learn I would understand that subject way better. Some people may say that its too much work to shape a curriculum based off how the student learns and that the student would need to learn to adapt to it .But if you were to do that grades and testing scores would rise because students are doing better.\n \n This is really important. Adapting the way students learn could possibly change ones future. In the past learning was state designed. They thought they knew the most effective way of a students way of learning but ended up hurting us. Student-designed summer assignments will help us grow in our education and succeed. We can start taking action now. Teachers can be more understanding and states should lookk to students to see how they could change the learning that fits to their students. After allÂ we are the future of America.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

Some people believe that the teacher should be the one to design these summer projects. other people believe that the students should design their own summer project. Teachers should be the ones to design these summer projects because they are the ones who know what is going to help the students get prepared for the next school year.\n \n Teachers are much more responsible than their students which makes them better candidates for designing summer projects. Teachers are more mature than their students. Teachers know what the students are going to need for the future. Teachers would know what would be the best thing to do for their students. Teachers overall are best choice when debating weather or not they should be the ones to design summer projects.\n \n Some people may still argue that students should be the ones to create their own summer projects because of reasons like, \"It's their summer project, let them do what they want\", or, \"They should get to choose how they want to learn over the summer\". While their may be some ground behind these claims, giving free choice to students like this is like giving a car to a child. They don't know what they are doing and it's just going to hurt them. These students could also rig the system in their favor and make it so easy that they don't need to learn anything, therefor, making the point of the summer project entirely pointless.\n \n Ultimately the greatest and smartest choice to make in this situation would be to just let the professionals do their job so that the student get what they need. Students just need to do what they are given so that they may get the best outcome out of all of this.",

      "Now trust me I know projects are not exciting and having them in the summer sounds terrible, but what if I told you having summer projects could be fun. If you got to pick who designed your summer projects who would you pick: teacher-designed or student-designed? Having student-designed projects is so unique and a great way to make projects more interesting. How about we switch it up a bit and instead of teachers creating the projects students do. Making summer projects student-designed would make it stress free on students, give them freedom, and it would make learning fun.\n \n I'm currently a high school student, so trust me I know how stressful school projects can be. If students designed these summer projects all the stress would go away. You would get to do the project on your own time and you'd get to pick what you want to learn about. Students wouldn't make the projects super hard or long because it is summer break and that's their time to relax. A teacher would normally give you a rubric or a set of guidelines you have to follow, but now you get to make it how you want.\n \n The possibilities are so endless if students got to build summer projects. You'd be able to pick how you want to do things and you could really bring out your creative side. It's the students break, this is when they don't want to think about school, so they should be able to decide whats best for them. You wouldn't have a list of things you need to follow you would be able to do whatever you wanted to. This would be such a great opportunity for students to enjoy learning and make it interesting.\n \n I know I've definitely gotten a topic to research about and it wasn't interesting to me at all. Having to do a project on something you find boring won't give you the motivation you'd need to push through it. If students got to pick what they wanted to learn, they wouldn't mind having these projects during summer break. Finding something to learn about that really interests you would make the experience as a whole ten times better. Maybe you're doing a poster on something you learned about in history, you get to enjoy learning about it and make that poster however you want to.\n \n Student-designed summer projects overall sound like something that would satisfy every student. Having teacher-designed projects would most likely be more organized and efficient, but students would have more fun and enjoy learning if it was student designed. Lets make learning over summer break something everyone would enjoy while also being able to relax. In conclusion, letting students create their own summer projects would give them the break they deserve, but to also assure they are still learning.Â",

      "The concepts our public schools come up with are great and efficient! Schools like to push their students to succeed and to be educated. For this reason, some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure that they retain the material and information they learned during the school year; furthermore, these projects should be teacher-designed. The best reasons that support this claim are that these projects are, in fact, beneficial to a students education as they help them retain information and will help students study, these projects can offer an opportunity for students to earn extra credit the next school year, and because a teacher will know a students academics strengths and weaknesses, a student will not.\n \n Extra credit is something a student may need to graduate, it is something universities look at, and it can bolster a students grade. These teacher-designed summer projects are a great concept to introduce into schools as one of the countless opportunities for students to excel and succeed. A summer project would be a project grade, a grade that can massively improve a students grade. Following after that, their GPA would increase do the positive grade. This is great for students, which is why it is the first reason as to why teachers should design the summer projects rather than students design them.\n \n Secondly, if projects are designed by teachers, they can help teachers understand where their students level of understanding is at. A student completing the project is more than a grade as a teacher can see where a students weaknesses and strengths are. If a teacher can find the material a student does and does not understand, they can reinforce and reteach the student the material in a way that suits the student better. If a student designed their own project, they would not know how to, as they would not know their own weaknesses and strengths as much as a teacher will, making teacher-designed projects during the summer much more efficient.\n \n Thirdly, teacher-designed projects will help students study and retain information; summer vacation is about 2-3 months long, students can forget important information during that time. A project that focuses on the core subject a student was learning will keep the material, information and concepts fresh in that students mind. This is crucial to do, as if the student is unprepared the next school year, they will fall far behind. If a student designed their project to help study, they would make it easier on themselves by not including the material they don't understand so they can learn it. Nobody can learn what they already know, which is why students should not design their own projects and why teachers should design their projects.\n \n However, that's not to say that even with teacher-designed projects there aren't faults. Even with studying and completing a project during the summer, a student can still forget the material. A student may know their own weaknesses and strengths and could be working on their weaknesses. And a teacher may make the decision to not grade the projects at all. That's also including that some teachers may actually tell students to make the project themselves as that allows the student to truly look at what makes the subject difficult for them, it allows the student to learn about the subject, and it helps the student to help the teacher understand what made the subject difficult for them.\n \n In conclusion, its best teachers design summer projects. While students can do it to and learn for themselves, a teacher is more skilled in this area of education and would help a student more than hinder them. A teacher giving extra credit, a project that challenges the student to help them retain the information, and a project that helps the teacher understand a students strengthsÂ and weaknesses is vital to a students success. Therefore, why shouldn't, wouldn't, or can't schools allow teachers to design summer projects for students?",

    Essay:
      "The American school system is unfortunately still on the fall-late spring school schedule, leaving students their summer out of school. Although all students would likely agree that this off-time is beneficial, the majority of students experience a 'summer slide' where they lose knowlede they have gained in the past year, and get out of the habit of learning. As a remedy to this, especially in higher level grades, schools assign summer projects in order to help students maintain the mindset of learning. How these summer assignments should be designed is very important to how the students use their knowledge during their break. If students designed the project, they would likely find the projects more enjoyable, but risk not actually learning much in the process. On the other hand, teacher-designed assignments may cause students to lose interest and not work their hardest on their project. Therefore, I think that a teacher designed, but creative assignment, would be most beneficial to students' learning curve over the summer. By assigning something creative with educational merit, students would enjoy working during their free time, learn new things, and prevent losing knowledge they have gained while they are on their summer vacation.\n \n Having fun with assignments is an essential part in keeping young students interested in school, particularly when they are on a break. If a student is assigned something they find boring, they are less likely to try as hard as they would on a more creative assignment. Also, if the assignment is more open to interpretation, it helps students think more creatively. Students would be much more likely to complete, and better yet, enjoy assignments that they find creative and fun. Meanwhile, a student with a duller assingment would not put their entire effort into it, and would surely rather be enjoying their vacation. By making the assignment itself more enjoyable, students would be 10 times more interested and likely to enjoy it.\n \n Though the creativity of the assingment is paramount, the educational value of the assignment is just as important. By having teachers design summer projects, this assures that the students will gain or keep their educational mindset and knowledge throughout their summer vacation. It's important that teachers do the designing of the project in order to guarentee that students are actually learning something through completing this project. Teachers should, however, consider the input of students while they are designing it, in order to make it more enjoyable and interesting for them, not just a boring assignment.\n \n In order to make sure that students can actually enjoy their projects, leaving it open to some interpretation can help a diverse set of students come up with individual ideas for their assignment. This would make it more interesting for everyone involved, and would also prevent students from copying each others' work, as well as helping them nourish their creativeness while they are out of school.\n \n By making summer assignments creative, but still educational, teachers can prevent students from getting out of the educational mindset over their break, as well as help them enjoy their work as much as they enjoy their time out of school. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, but still have room for creative and original ideas that will help the students enjoy their work and their individuality as they complete their summer work.",

However, as I thought I would be free from the chains, I am held back once again as teachers began to assign tedious summer project. Tired and with my strong desires of a break, I waited till the last couple weeks of summer before starting on the time consuming project.Â Recently, an argument has risen about whether summer projects should be student deigned or teacher designed. People who believe that the projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects would increase the percentage of participation on these projects. Others, who believed that it should be teacher designed, argue back that the knowledge teachers have on the curriculum allows the projects to be truly designed for its main intention.Â Teachers should be designing these summer project because of their knowledge of the future curriculum and their understandingÂ of the mindset of students.\n \n Teachers are well equipped with the knowledge of the future curriculum, thus they have the ability to adjust their lesson plans to help assist their students for the upcoming years. Seen by many students, lessons or skills learned in the previous school year are used in the present school year. For example, math facts, such as addition and subtraction, are constantly being referred to in all math courses. Acknowledging this reality, teachers would try to shift their lesson plans around for the purpose of trying to strengthen their students ability to understand such skills. Similar theory is applied to the designing of summer projects. Teachers, with the knowledge of what is expected in the next couple courses of a students life, would be able to shape projects into helping the students prepare for the upcoming school year.\n \n Teachers' understanding of the mindset of typical students causes the summer projects to be unbiased. People who believed that the summer projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects will encourage for more participation, due to the fact that these projects will have a more simple design and be more easier to understand. However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects.\n \n Having a easier summer project not only doesn't shift the percentage of participation, but also causes a strain in the development or knowledge of the student over the summer. Almost all teachers have witnessed students who refuse to complete homework, thus, they understand that lowering the difficulty would not change participation. This observation causes the teachers to not design the projects in favor of student's emotions, but rather design the projects according to the theory of helping their students.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have understanding about future curriculum and understanding about the actions of a typical student. One of the main goals of a teacher is to assist students or help students succeed in life. Therefore, logically, everything a teacher does is to benefit the students. Teachers, unbiased about the emotions of a student, will challenge their students into achieving high goals. In their best efforts, teachers would try to assist their students in trying to acquire beneficial skills. Teachers understand that some students will try to challenge authority by refusing to complete assignment, instead of signing in defeat, they will persistent in their teaching methods because they understand that defeat wouldn't help the student. Thus, teachers should have the opportunity to design summer projects because they are guaranteed to have design projects that benefit students. Many successful businessmen, doctors, or scientists, credit their success to teachers. The profession of teachers have existed for many generations and have been known as the source of many successful people's success. Therefore, their ability to create a summer project should not be questioned.Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay:
      "There are many schools that require students to complete a summer project. Most of these projects are either student designed or teacher designed. However, these summer projects should be designed by students all of the time. The projects should be designed by students because they would show each students creativity and passion but also show their ability to work on something independently.\n \n First, the ability for students to design projects would allow them to express their creativity in unique ways. If each student designs a project there would be countless different creative and unique versions. For example, one student might make a movie for his project while another student creates a podcast. This creativity would not only make projects more interesting but students may also enjoy them more because of the creative freedom. On the other hand, if the project was teacher designed there would less variation and a lot of of the same boring and bland projects. Clearly, summer projects should be student designed so students can express their creativity.\n \n Secondly, if students designed their projects they would have the ability to do projects about something they're passionate about. If students did their projects on what they were interested in they would most likely do a lot better job and put more time into it. For example, a student who is interested in cars would put more effort into a project about cars rather than if a teacher assigned him a project about wildlife. In addition, this project about wildlife would probably end up not expressing creativity and lacking information because there would be no passion for the project. Also, the ability for a student to do research on a topic that interests them allows for them to learn about something that could be a potential career choice in the future. While researching a student may learn that the topic is not quite what they thought it was or may learn that it's something they wanna continue to gain more knowledge about and make a career of it one day. Obviously, summer projects should be student designed, so students can learn about their passions and be motivated to do a better job.\n \n Lastly, a student designed project would show their ability to work on something independently. If student designed more of the workload falls onto the student than the teacher. The ability to design and complete an entire project without any teacher help would take massive amounts of independent work skills. In addition, the ability to be independent is very important, and one day students will be out on their own without any teacher or adult to show them the way. This project has potential to teach students how to do things independently. However, if teacher designed the students would have everything laid out for them but that is nothing like the real world in, which a person will have to do everything on their own. All in all, the potential to learn how to do things independently is massive with a student designed project.\n \n Many schools have summer projects that must be completed over the break and some of these projects are teacher designed. Although, when teacher designed these projects lack creativity, interest from students, and independent work skills. Therefore, these summer projects should be student designed so that they are creative, interest the students, and teach students how work independently.Â Â",

    Essay:
      "Imagine going to the last day of the school year. Imagine the fun summer that is waiting for the span of about two months. Now... imagine enjoying the last week of the summer vacation, but then realizing there is a summer project assigned by one of the classes due on the first day back. Following a teacher's directions while doing a school project can be difficult some times, especially when the teacher did not give their email/contact information regarding on the project. Therefore, who is going to help explain the instructions? Projects should be fun to do, not tedious based on teacher's instructions. So why let their minds go to waste as the years go by, when they can explore the world through a more interactive, more attractive kind of way? Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows a creative aspect in specific students' minds, it can help them stay on top of the assignment at hand while being interested, and it helps the teachers themselves by looking at different ones from different people and viewing the topic in different perspectives.\n \n Creativity is where the mind of most people take a different turn on certain topics. Creativity should not be kept in a box, it should be someplace else: a wall, a canvas, paper, books, music- everywhere and anywhere it can and should be, as long as it is not crammed inside; sitting there as the dust falls on the area, leaving it gray. Although some students may say that they are not creative, or not that innovative- but they most certainly are, they just need a small extra push in the right route. The reason why they are so negative on being creative is because that little part of the brain labeled 'creativity' is covered in dust. Their minds are plagued by the dust, and they are not reaching their full potential of creativity. Creativity is how a person views the world through their eyes; not through their friends' eyes, or through their parents, or school, it is through their own. It is imperative that students really take a try at being creative because it opens their eyes to a world full of other possibilities. They will see the world in all of its colorful splendor. Homework assignments, classwork... all boring assignments when the teachers give specific instructions on how to do them. Not very creative, and not that very thought-provoking either. It bores the class being swamped with regular assignments. But, when a group project comes around, why is that subject the only one being touched on through creativity? That, is very limiting. Every assignment should have an option; an option that can give a better grade on creativity than a normal, typed up/written assignment because it is important to not keep the creativity stuck inside the students' minds. All while they are touching up on their creativity, they are more invested at the task assigned to them.\n \n Investing time, is time consuming. To be fair, it is supposed to help others be more organized, or to be more punctual, but how? Sure, the teachers can say that it is going to help them continue learning throughout the summer- that is filled with fun plans along with enjoying time socializing with others, but everyone knows that they are going to do it either the first week of summer or the week before it is due. No in-between. Summer is supposed to be enjoying, not filled with dread and anxiety of a school project. But, if a little creativity is sprinkled through the instructions, then students will be a little less stressed and anxious about finishing the project because they are the ones who are making the rules and the guidelines of the task. That, is more eye-opening than paperwork that relatively looks similar to parents' taxes and bills. Adults always tell the 'young ones' to do something that interests them more. Sports? Whichever appeals to their eyes and their physique and how much they can take. How many times has someone asked, \"what do you like?\" Countless of times. How many times have they actually answered with a straightforward answer? Sometimes. Being interested on assignments are important, because this gives students more elbow room to work with than a structurally four-by-four square box with a pencil, eraser and paper. It helps them work with an open mind, it helps them stress less and turn in the project on the first day back, brimming with confidence. Creativity is to be shown to others, including the teachers who assigned the task over the summer.\n \n Classes can either be a very hands-on type of experience or a very claustrophobic one. Teachers are somewhat under appreciated. They are either too strict or they are just simply \"fun\" to hang around- they can be boring and monotone or they can be interesting and colorful. Everyone has been through a lot of teachers, but when have they ever been through a teacher who was strict, yet fun at the same time? Very few have. It is like\n \n Goldilocks , when she tries each porridge, each chair, then each bed. Those teachers make everything \"just right\" for students. When assignments come around, every teacher is staring at the same black and white sheets of paper, but if they were to look at different ones- different styles of writing, different colors used, different methods tackling the subject, they would not have to strain over Times New Roman font text or illegible handwriting. Overall, it benefits the teachers by showing how the students viewed the assignments and how effective it was when it was assigned.\n \n Finally, students should have their summer projects based from their own rules because it helps them focus more, it helps them take a break from the regular classwork, and it helps teachers have a refresher to look at. It benefits everyone in the long run. It gives a sense of accomplishment because they did well on the summer assignment. A good grade to start off the school year, along with a good, fresh mood to start the year off. Find a colorful, more creative way to start the year off.",

    Essay:
      "Numerous schools nationwide require students to complete projects over summer break. These summer assignments are primarily used to maintain learning and knowledge through summer. Furthermore, said projects are likely teacher-designed; an upright design flaw . If. instead, the projects were student designed; students would be engaged in democratic teamwork, they'd likely actually complete their assignment, and doing so would take stress off both the teachers and students' backs alike.\n \n Most of the time in school, students are simply told what to do, how to do it (or not do it), and then graded upon their achievement or failure. Most students are hardly given a say in anything they have to do. However, in a student designed summer project, they'd be given an opportunity to practice having a voice and opinion. All the students would grow closer to one another as they come up with the best idea; something that's missed out on with teacher designed projects. Not only would students be closer, but they'd get to collaberate as individuals working towards a common goal. This is something that is seen in governments, so it'd be great for students to get experience with collaberation. Student led design would also be majorly inclusive, since they all want the same thing (an easier assignment). Regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, etc, students all have the same willingness to get a better project idea together.\n \n A lot of students wait till the last minute to even do their summer assignments, if at all. Student designed projects would change that. If the project is designed by them, they'd have a much greater interest in the topics chosen. Interest is actually the primary motivating factor towards completion, according to Princeton's 2012 study. With greater interest, comes greater enjoyment. Nobody would really enjoy a project they were assigned, but if they were there for the whole process it would be much more enjoyable. Students even may feel an obligation to complete their projects to a more satisfactory level, or all the design work would've been for nothing.\n \n A huge problem in todays education system is the level of stress held by students and teachers. A student designed assignment would allow a lot of unnecissary stress to eliviate, though. Teachers wouldn't worry about if the projects good, over completetion, or the stress of creating a project in the first place. Students, on the other hand, would be given the power to know and create what they have to do, which will allow a much greater understanding of the project once they begin. This is especially true for students who may start their assignments later in the summer. If the assignment was designed by students, they would better retain the knowledge and understanding of what's required of them to do. Although student designed projects wouldn't get rid of all school related stress, it'd definetely be a step in the right direction.\n \n There are many things that can be adapted in our education system, but something as simple as this would have nothing but a positive impact on everyone. A student designed project can introduce students to teamwork and divergant / convergant thought, reduce on overall stress, and push students to complete their assignments. Students should lead the way, since in just a few years those student's will become our teachers, politicians, and scientists; all people who must design and push the bar higher. Â Â",

      "How do you feel about students summer being teacher designed or student designed? I agree that student projects should be designed by themselves. Students will be able to have there own creative project rather than, having the same thing as there friends. Students wouldn't think that other people are cheating from there projects.\n \n In my opinion, I agree that students summer projects should be student designed.\n \n Firstly, Students summer projects should be based on students designed because of the creativity of students.\n \n In this generation students have a lotÂ of creative ideas and that It can be use in there classwork. Students doing projects that are student designed will give students to think about what they will do instead of being outside and doing the wrong thing. For example, Generic_Name has a project that he has to do over the summer but, his teacher says that It has to be In her order and that it has to be plain. When Generic_Name gets home he decidedÂ to go outside with his friends. since Generic_Name cannot be creative on his project he will not start on It.\n \n Next, I think students wouldn't protect there project from other students anymore If they have to do there own creative project. It Is more than 45% of students cheat In the U.S today, students will have more trust in their peers around them If they be able to use their creative mind. For instance, Generic_Name and Generic_Name are doing there projects but Generic_Name walks out to use the bathroom, Generic_Name meanwhile gets up and take pictures of Generic_Name project because, he forgot how there teacher told them how to do It. Since Generic_Name forgot how to do the project he had to cheat.\n \n Furthermore, I agree that students summer projects should be students designed but, If the project the teacher gives out Is by there designed It can help In many different ways. Teachers will be able to have lesser work while checking these projects If they are by there own designed. Teachers will be able to grade In a short amount of time because If the student follows the directions, the teacher wouldn't have to be frustrated on the grade.\n \n Finally, students should be able to designed there projects rather than having your teacher deciding what to do.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "We as people get dumb, it's true, over a period of time we get dumber. To counter-act this problem schools started to assign projects over the summer to keep student learning. When I was in high school we had a huge summer break project, thankfully in my case it was a group project, but what was interesting is that our teacher asked if we, the students, design the project or if the teachers do. Some may believe that it would be better to let the students design these, but it's better if the teachers do because you will get good practice, you dont have to do work designing it, and it will help you in the future.\n \n One reason why teachers should design these summer projects is because you would get good practice. After a long break I sometimes have trouble getting the mindset ready to learn again, I often don't pay attention after a break because I am still in that kind of mind set. If teachers assign these projects, with their ideas, it would help me get ready for the school year. It is better for the teachers to design these instead of the students because they hand out good hard working projects, if students made these I fear they would make it too easy so they can get it over and done with.\n \n One other reason why teachers should design summer projects is because, well so they have to make it and we don't. I am going to be honest, nobody likes to do a summer project, they may be helpful but they are boring, so why should students waste more time designing the projects, then have to do the actual thing. It would be better for the teachers to make these so students don't waste more working time designing these. If teachers made the project then the students can give their full attention into completing it, not creating it. For example, when I had to do a summer project, I had the luxury of focusing only working on the project; while my friend, who goes to a different school, had to design their own. He told me that it was harder because he worked hard designing it and got really tired just from designing.\n \n One final reason why teachers should design summer projects is that it will help you in the long run. For me, I was one of the top workers because in my job they require you to work at all times, even during your breaks. Thanks to school, with my teacher giving me a summer project, since they designed the project, it was a good hard working one made my an adult. This helped me practice doing projects over breaks so I was able to do wellÂ in the future. Again, if students made this they would most likely make the projects easy. If students made things easy for themselves, it wont help them in the future. If their future job required them to work all the time, they would struggle at first because they made it too easy for themselves and their job would want them to do adult level work.\n \n Some might say that letting the students design summer projects is the right option; however, it is better to let the teachers make them because you would get good practice, you don't have to waste time designing the project, and it will help you in the future.",

      "Students and teachers as well can all agree school tends to be very stressful. When summer comes along it gives everyone a opportunity to relax, put our stress from school aside, and just have fun during our break. On the other hand,not everyone gets to enjoy summer as much. Certain schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. The main debate is if these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed.\n \n Students young minds have so much creativity and potential to design their own project idea to make it a interesting and fun way of learning, but still being able to meet the requirements to get a good grade. Students designing their own projects lets them expand their knowledge to show what they already know, to create their project. A lot of students will dread having to complete a summer assignment. Some may feel it gets in the way of having time off from school,so designing it themselves will give them more freedom to make it not as boring by using their creativity to come up with a unique idea. Teachers also have a lot of stress going on and often have a lot of work to do with grading papers, this gives them time to relax by not having to worry about what to design for their students.\n \n Students can also help one another by sharing ideas and working together. They have the choice whether to make it a big design or a small design and have a variety of options to chose from. While working on their design they may also discover new things in the process from research and learn more. It's more excitement to the students to see what they come up with and theyll be more eager to show it off. Students can see this as a challenge to try and come up with a creative design and be competitive.\n \n On the other hand, it's understandable if some may feel that a teacher-designed assignment will be the better choice, given the fact that students just want to enjoy their summer break. Some students can fearÂ having to design their own assignment could possibly add more stress from having to come up with a worthyÂ project. To sum it all up a student-designed assignment would be a better fit for students and have more positive factors than having a teacher-designed assignment.Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Summer is what students look forward to every year. For most, there's no homework to worry about or any assignments/ projects to do. But, on the other hand, there are also some schools that require assigned projects during the summer for students so that they continue to learn during their break. For schools that do that, those summer projects should be student-designed and here's why.\n \n With having student-designed projects over the summer, it creates a balance so that students can both enjoy summer and so that they can also have enough time to do any work that needs to get done. For example, students go out and about their day by going to the pool or hanging out with their friends. But, once they get home they can spend those 20-30 minutes to complete parts of their project. That right there is the balance between summer and school. It should be able to fit/work for students. After all, these students do need a break and shouldn't be overwhelmed with work. It is their summer, they shouldn't be robbed out of it with a project.\n \n Now, some might say that during the summer they don't have enough time or that they're too busy with family to complete the whole project. And that's true, students are relatively busy over the summer with plans or vacations with family. So, it's understandable to think that some may not complete the whole project. For instance, a friend of mine travels to a different country every year over the whole summer. How would she be able to complete her project if it was teacher-designed? With making it student-designed it applies to students and how they'll manage their time to finish that project. Any student would be able to finish the student-designed project because, it won't be long. It'd be short but, enough so that students will still continue to learn enough from it.\n \n Let's say that these summer projects would be teacher-designed. The work load would not be fair for students. It would only apply to how the teachers would want and not the students. Teachers would expect them to finish that project regardless of the situation which isn't fair. Then, students would start to become stressed and overwhelmed because they don't have enough time to finish their work. Therefore, they can't enjoy their summer because all they'll end up doing is stressing instead of having fun. It won't be balanced enough for them to do both.\n \n In conclusion, these projects should be student-designed because in the end students are the ones who are doing them, not the teachers. Student-designed projects benefit both teachers and students in the long run. Teachers don't have that much to grade when they get back and they still educate their students at the same time. And as for students, they still have enough time to enjoy their summer and continue to learn at the same time because it was designed for them to.Â",

      "Should school summer projects be created by students or teachers?\n \n Imagine its the last day of school , everyone is excited to get out of school, but the teacher said there will be a summer project. Everyone would be upset and disapointed, but what if that teacher gave you a choice to create your own summer assignment? Although some people say summer assignments are more effective, actually summer assignments are more effective when created by students.\n \n Some people think summer assignments are better off in the hands of a teacher, because they believe teachers have more experience, and can provide the best preparation for the following year. For instance, you have a history teacher teaching world history, but towards the end of fourth quarter he gives you a large packet on US history to complete for a summer project. This shows that the specific teacher who was teaching world history, is trying to prepare the student the best he can, by providing him with a project with all the information he needs to know to succeed in a history class the following year.\n \n However, if students were given a choice to design their own summer projects, they would be able to work on topics they enjoy, which will change the mood on summer assignments forever. For instance, if a teacher decided to give summer assignments over the long break, she would give her students a big boring projects thats due in the fall. However, if that teacher gave the student a choice to create thier own project, it could be portrayed from their own personal interests, which would make the student much more excited to complete the project. Furthermore, if something interests you, you will be excited to do it, but if something is boring, than you are more likely to feel depressed about doing it, which would eventually lead to procrastination.\n \n On the other hand, if students were given a choice to create their own summer project, the rate of missing projects would decrease tremendously. For instance, a teacher gives everyone a project on world war one, but the people who enjoy wars and the event of world war one would do the project with excitement, while others would do it because they want good grades. However, if students created their own project, it would allow everyone the right to choose thier own topic. This would make everyone excited to do thier own project. This will also allow students to pick out thier particular interest, which will make them more likely to do the project leading to the downfall of missing assignments.\n \n Also, if students were given a choice to design their own summer project, it possibly could influence them and in the future they might consider going into a teaching major. For instance, if a student was designing a project, and had great interest in planning the project itself, it might give him an inspiration to become a teacher in the future. This not only will help the student plan his future, but it would also allow others to find their future as well. If all the students were allowed to plan their own summer project, there could be a possibility that at least one of the students enjoyed planning the project ultimately influencing them to become a teacher.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the choice to design their own summer projects, because of the benefits it provides. This would not only cause the rate of missing projects to decline, but it will also let students chose their topics for their projects, making the student excited to complete the assignment. It will also create a plan for students who enjoyed planning the project, ultimately influencing them to go into a teaching major.",

This is a great idea, but how shouldÂ this be executed? Should the projects be teacher or student designed? Giving the student the ability to create their project would encourage them to explore more in depth or maybe even new interests. Along with this this it would force the student to be creative, an otherwise lacking skill in Virginia school systems. On the other hand, having the projects be teacher made would make them more easy to asses. The summer projects should be student designed because, it allows the student to pursue their own interest, also it makes the student be creative; adversely, having them be teacher made would allow for the teacher to much easier asses the student.\n \n First of all, having student made summer projects would help the students find what interest them. This is an important step in piecing together your future. Me personally, a junior in high school, has no idea what field of work best interests me. Exposing these young minds to as many topics as possible could significantly help them choose an occupation to peruse. Having them create their own projects would help them deeper explore,or understand their interests. Therefore, student created projects would help spark interest.\n \n Also, giving them the freedom to design their project would force them to be creative. School seems to suck all the creativity right out of its students. From the never ending notes to the standards set by the state. There seems to be no room for creativity, or individualism. It always seems to be bland and without color.\n \n We as a community forget that not everyone is a textbook kind ofÂ learner. There is a lot that factors into the psychology of learning and many forget that. Having projects more open ended and student designed would shed some of this pressure, and allow for the students to be creative and do their best work. Also creativity is extremely important. The earth is a never ending cycle of creation. Who will be the next Steve Jobs or maybe carry out an even bigger legacy. creativity sparks change, it makes us advance as the human race. In conclusion, giving the students the task of designing their summer projects will let them be creative.\n \n Lastly, letting the students design their projects would make it harder for the teacher to asses the student. This is important to the teacher. The teacher needs to know who needs help and with what. They need to help make sure you are prepared for the real world. A good teacher is truly a miracle worker. They need some way of assessing students. But this is not the way. The students should have many more options in the way they learn, but that is what tests are for. Therefore, it is important to be able to asses theirÂ students, but designing their projects is going about it all wrong.\n \n To conclude, summer projects should be student designed, rather than teacher designed. It will help the student figure out their interest better. It could even interest them to learn at all. And it lets the students be creative and let their minds free from the joke that is our school system. It shows how being yourself and being creative can positively impact you, and could even spark new interests. Therefore, Students should design their own summer projects to show them their interests and to also allow them to be creative and learn in a way that appeals to them.Â",

    Essay:
      "If a school was to require a summer break they should allow the students to create their summer projects because it will be more creative, teachers just make useless busy work and the students are more likely to personally learn from the experience.\n \n Students being involved in their summer project will allow students to get creative and think for themselves. Summer projects get students in a negative state of mind because they would prefer to enjoy their break and hang out with friends. If they are given the creativity to make their own summer project they might collaborate with friends and make a really cool project with all the free time they have. If students were given their own opportunities to make fun projects with friends over the break they will create more interactive, and impressive work.\n \n If a teacher was to make an assignment over the break it would be super boring and most likely just busy work. If it were a math assignment it would just be a packet or some problems to get you back into the unit before summer starts. English teachers often just make kids read books that are super boring and lack their interest over the summer. Teachers tend to make work over the break pointless and when the students do work over the break it makes them hate the class before they've even started it. It also adds an extra level of stress when summer is supposed to be free time. Some kids come back to school and have a forty-five page packet due in math class by the first week of school. Teachers overall make school harder than it has to be by assigning pointless busy work over summer break.\n \n One way this could have a bad turnout if kids made their own projects due to the fact that they won't want design a creative and fun project. Some if not most kids will see that they have to make an assignment over the break, they'll buy a poster board,Â they'll copy and paste a few articles about a boring topic and glue them to the poster board. They won't put any effort into a summer project because they don't want to do work over their break. They find a project over the break to be very counter intuitiveÂ because they've just done work for nine months straight and do not want to keep doing work. Kids do not want to do a project over the break in the first place and if they see that it is easy and has no positive effect on their schooling they'll make it quick and easy and never worry about the project again.\n \n The final way a student made project will have a better outcome is they'll actually personally learn from the experience. If a student is given their own choice about a summer project in englsh class. They're more likely to pick a book of their interest and actually finish the book instead of just skim reading it, looking up a summary or even watching the movie if that is an option. If the student picks their own book of interest they'll read the whole thing, gain important information about the book and be ready to discuss it once school starts again. If the students have summer project in history and really like World War II but the teacher assigns them the Civil Rights movement they're more likely to not do the project. If they're allowed to pick their own topic and write a report about World War II like they're personally interested in they're gonna do the project and do it right. They'll gain from this personal experience and have a good time while doing it.\n \n Students' learning should not be done through busy work or packets with fifty pages. It should be done through personal interest and personal involvment. When a student learns a packet is the most boring and pointless thing a student can receive. Given their own choice on summer projects students are more likely to get involved, genuinely learn from the experience and not be handed premade expected projects where they have to follow a boring rubric to the tea and lack creativity.",

      "Some schools require studentsÂ to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning on their break. The question now is should those projects be teacher designed or student designed.? The most logical thing to do would be to have the teachers design the projects because they will be the ones grading the projects,their the the ones who know what we should and shouldn't know yet, and as long as students are working so should teachers.\n \n The benefit of having a teacher making a project for students instead of students making projects for students is that students would ether make it way to hard on themselves or way to easy. Students would need a teacher to hit that sweet spot for them so they only have to worry about doing there work. It would be easy for the teacher too because then everybody'sÂ project would be the same format for grading.\n \n Teachers have been doing there jobs for years now and have a general understanding of what knowledgeÂ students should retain over their breaks. This is why they should be making the projects not students. We would be getting so much more out of it if the teachers designed the projects.\n \n Many students get jobs in the summer because they cant during the school year due to the fact there at school all day, and the second they get out its hours on top of hours of homework. If we were to make students design their own projects and do them and have a normal break we would be asking the impossible from most students, this is why students would need teacher help.\n \n In conclusion students would absolutely need teachers to be the ones to design the summer projects because of their background in Teaching, education, grading, and assignment making talents. teachers also have summers off so they would have plenty of time for all of this.",

    Essay:
      "Would you want to spend the entire summer on a project that youre not getting a grade for, not enthusiastic about, and are never going to see again in your life? Well that is exactly how students feel about teacher-designed projects. It is important forÂ students to meet the teachers half-way in all classroom situations. It is the teacher's responsibility to set expectations and requirements, as well as help the students get things done. However, it is the student's responsibility to accept that help and actively participate in class. But, it can be hard to do that unless you care about the topic being presented. That being said, I believe that these summer projects should be designed and executed by the students. The teachers should lay out their expectations and the students should try to exceed them. I believe this because, in my experience, when teachers try to tell the students exactly what to do, they feel that the teachers don't trust them to make their own decisions. This is also a way to motivate the students to continue learning. If students could decide what they wanted to learn more about, and focus on that rather than what the teachers want, then they are likely to be more interested. Furthermore, allowing students to design their own projects, forces them to be creative and think outside of the box, thus developing skills that could be helpful in the future.\n \n One reason that student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects is that the former give students the opportunity to show what they care about.Â If students are given the opportunity to design their own projects, it is likely that they are going to pick a topic that they are enthusiastic or passionate about. When they do, they will want to continue to learn more about it. For example,Â My brother is not very interested in the typical things they teach in middle school. He would much rather be building model kits or learning more about the ever-growingÂ Star Wars universe and story line. But every year, at his middle school, they do this thing called a Passion Project, which allows students to pick any topic and complete a project on it --which they will present to their entire grade-- and every year my brother does it on machinery or weapons in the Star Wars universe. He puts a lot of time and effort into this project each year and the results are phenomenal, showing that with passion, you can accomplish anything to the best of your ability.\n \n The next reason that student-designed projects are better is that teachers will be able to trust students to make reasonable academic decisions.Â If teachers gave students the opportunity to show that they can be studious, then teachers would trust students to make their own decisions and get work done without being micro-managed.Â I realized this when I was assigned a history project in sophomore year. We were put into groups of two, and were assigned to different genocides throughout history that we had to research and create a poster on. When I was assigned the Rwandan Genocide I was excited to start this project. The Rwandan Genocide was something that I had done research on before and I was enthusiastic about spreading the information to those who had not heard of it yet. This resulted in the teacher trusting me and my partner do our own work without her having to ask about our progress very often. That poster ended up getting a 100% and was one of the best posters I had created because I was enthusiastic about the topic.\n \n Additionally, student-designed projects force the students to think about educational topics on their own, without adult guidance leading the whole process. Teaching yourself is a very important skill that you should have in the future.Â If students got into the habit of primarily relying on themselves, they are setting themselves up for success because every functioning adult needs self-reliance.Â Before someone grows up, they must first learn how to manage their own schedules, complete their own work, and rely on themselves rather than others to get things done. The best time to learn those things is as a teenager. If teachers are designing and managing students' projects, then what exactly is the student learning? In student-designed projects, the student is the one making all of the decisions that affect the project, which is why they can be beneficial to young teenagers. Students must learn and understand how to take their lives (and projects) into their own hands.\n \n To conclude, not only do student-designed projects motivate the students by allowing them to use their enthusiasm to fuel their education, but they also help students become more independent and self-reliant by teaching them how to design and manage a project on their own. Student-designed projects also help teachers form a trust with their students by allowing them to show that they can take control of their own academic life. These skills can be helpful throughout the coming school year, and life, as well.",

      "It is the last day of school, the only thing on your mind is your exciting vacation and the warm weather, the only time that you are free from teachers telling you to what to do and when to do it. When all of a sudden your teacher says that you have a long and tedious project that is due at the end of summer. As a response to this, I argue that students should be the ones designing these projects, in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience designing the project.\n \n Throughout the school year, projects that are assigned by teachers don't capture student's true capabilities and skills. However, if students designed their own projects, they could finally display their strengths, which would lead to an increase in motivation for perfecting the project. Furthermore, students have responsibilities and activities during the summer that may cause a low quality project to emerge if they don't have much motivation. For example, students who compete in the school science fair do very well because designing your own project increases motivation for yielding a higher quality project.\n \n I once heard, \"necessity is the mother of invention.\" This quote is indicating that when their is high demand for something, or if someone is wondering how or why something works, new inventions and innovations are made. When considering projects, the same rule applies; questioning what you are interested in yields innovation that have built this country since day one. For example, Bill Gates wouldn't have founded Microsoft is he didn't research and look into what he was interested in. This proves that when students create their own projects based on questioning and logic, their is a greater chance for success.\n \n During the school year, everything is designed by teachers: tests, projects and homework. In response to this, I raise an important question, how do you expect us to be the next generation of well rounded and intelligent people, when we have been told what to do and when to do it since day one? The only way to give students this freedom of choosing how to design the project without disrupting normal school schedule, is to assign it in the summer. Not only does this bolster self thinking and creativity, but also it utilizes the summer months, a long period of time, to think about and develop this project.\n \n In response to the question of giving students the right to design their own projects, I argue that in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience, the best choice is to give students this ability to design their own projects. In general, these skills will help students prepare for adult life, where they will need the specific skills that are full filedÂ through this project.",

      "Is giving students homework during their Summer Break a good thing? Does it allow them to retian information and hopefully use it for next year? But even better, should these students be even given the privelage of assigning their own homework? No,Its up to the teachers to give teacher-designed projects for the students because they know what to teach us ,how to teach us,and ultimately whats best for us,students can't be trusted to assign their own project,and teachers know what things we have to know for next year.\n \n Teachers are people we go to when we need to learn things. They give us the answers we're seeking for. When assigning projects,they don't just make it easy for you. They make it a challenge ,not just because they want to or because we think they don't like us. It's because they know what's best for us. They know what's best for us in a way that a parent knows what's best for their children. When I was younger my mom always made sure I hung out with the right group of people. She said \"son ,when you're older you'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.\"Now I wasn't really fond of this ,but it ended up helping me out in the future when she told me to stop hanging out with this group of certain people who always used to mess around in class and they got caught throwing fart bombs in class and the whole group got in trouble. I'm getting a little off track here, but the point im trying to make here is ,teachers know what's best for us. They know how to teach,what to teach,the best way to teach us ,and what is best to teach us.\n \n Its not every day that the teachers give us a chance to assign our own projects. This would be a once in a lifetime opportunity that the teachers are giving us. The ability to choose our own project. WOW! I wish we were mature enough to handle that responsability. But,the truth is we would make it as easy as possible. You may be thinking heck yea that sounds perfectly fine to me. But,in doing that you would defeat the whole point of doing the Summer project in the first place. Let's think,what\"s the whole point of doing this project. Is it because we have all that freetime during break that they want us doing something productive? Or because we have nothing better to do? Its to help prepare us for next year and what we might learn. I have to admit ,I forget pretty much everything I learn last year. Which is super bad because when I get into the next school year that information from last year that i forgot could be needed in the class for next year. Which it is why it's important that we make it a challenge and acyually know what we need to study. So that we can retain more information. That is why kids can't be trusted to assign their own project.\n \n The last and final reason why teachers should assigning our summer project is because they know what we need to learn for next year. Going into the new school year is really hard when we have to come in and learn things we've never seen before in our life. But, with teahcers assigning our projects,we could maybe get an idea of what we're learning. That would be extraordinarely helpful to kids who have a hard time learning because with projects being assigned to us ,we could finally study over break with information we'll be using next year. Giving us better grades ,and dont we all just love good grades. They boost our confidence up .And showing your parents your all \"A\" report card can be lifechanging. Ultimately this is why teachers should assign our projects over Summer Break.\n \n In teachers assigning our Summer Break projects ,we have a better opportunity at passing the coarses in the following school year,We have something to do over break,and it gives us extra brain work and hepls us grow our school brains. Allowing us to be succeseful and setting us up for greatness in the upcoming school year. Teachers know what we should study and how we should study in order to retain the information needed to be learned and revised.",

    Essay:
      "Summer is like a brainwash. Students seem to forget everything they learned in school that year over the summer. To try and combat this, many teachers assign summer projects so the students don't fall behind on any of their learning. Students are often upset by this, wanting their summer to be fun and stress free. Teacher designed projects are often long and tedious making them boring to do. The summer projects should be student-designed. Having the projects be student-designed allows for a greater range of creativity, more control over how the project is completed, and creates a better mindset for disgruntled students.\n \n Allowing for summer projects to be student designed makes for a greater range of creativity. A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations.\n \n Completion of the project is thought to be most important. Allowing students to control how the project is completed is much more student oriented. A student oriented project should be more fun and less stressful as to not add anything more on top of an already heavy workload. Letting students decide how the project is presented and what the rubric should entail makes the students not only happier, but less stressed as a result. If the students can control what they want to do in the project or how the final product should be, it could help immensely with the overall students happiness and create a stronger student community.\n \n The mindset for summer is just fun, fun, fun. Adding a summer project dampens that mindset. It becomes a burden for students to deal with. No one wants to do schoolwork over the summer, summer is the time for fun! Allowing students to create a student designed project would create an overall better mindset towards how summer project are viewed. I know that I don't want to do school work over the summer. Giant math packets, books to read, papers to write, it's all so tedious and I always end up pushing it off til August, where I'm then rushing to get it all done in time for the start of school. If I were to be given a project that I could control, it would already seem so much better because I would be in full control over what I did for the project or how I approached a problem I encountered with it. It's important to keep a healthy mindset in school so you don't burn yourself out. Summer is seen as a time to destress and have fun and creating a better mindset towards student project by making them student designed is extremely crucial to that.\n \n When I think of school projects, I think of teachers handing them out at the end of a quarter or towards the end of school to be completed over the summer. Projects are a way to either boost or bring down your grade, depending on how you do. Because of that effect on grades, important projects tend to stress students out. When students are given more control over a project it immediately takes stress off the student because they automatically control how their project is made and presented. Teacher designed projects are made to showcase how well teachers teach their students. If more students get a higher grade on a project, the credibility of that teacher goes up. They are viewed as a better teacher overall. While teacher designed projects might have more academic results, having projects be student-designed creates a wider range of creativity, control over how the project is executed, and makes a more postive mindset for students.",

      "Some schools require its students to complete summer assignments, this raises the question of whether these projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed? Which would be more beneficial to both the educator and the learner? Students would better benefit from completing an assignment structured by teachers because they have received an education on how to teach adolescents, understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-structured for many reasons, one of them being that the teachers have been educated on student learning. Before even being able to become an educator, teachers have to complete an education of their own; where they learn the most beneficial way to help another person understand something. Compared to an adolescent, who most likely isn't thinking the same way, it is clear that one will have much more success than the other in getting the lesson through. One is focused on how to get the point acrossÂ as efficiently as possible and the other simply doesn't have the same thought process. The vigorous work done to obtain a teaching degree also ensure that those who are taught under the educator are not put in a stressful situation, learn at a comfortable speed, and are challenged just enough. Proving that teacher-designed assignments guarantee not only that the individual is learning, but learning effectively.\n \n Another reason that proves why teacher-designed summer projects are more efficient is that the teacher better understands where a students is in their learning and where they should be by what time. For example, more experienced educators have seen quite a lot of different students with different learning patters and know how to manipulate that to the benefit of the student and themselves. This trait is most useful in a situation that the students in a class are in completely different areas in their understanding. The teacher is then able to build projects that are unique to each individual's strengths and weaknesses. Which consequently allows the class to collectively reach the same high level of understanding, all while working individually.\n \n It is impossible for a student to design an project about a topic that they dont' already know about. Teachers should be the one's structuring the summer assignment because they are able to give the learner an unknown topic that could even possibly interest them. A student-designed project serves no purpose in assuring that a student will continue learning, but only review materials that they have already learned. Giving teachers control over the project prompts the student to research unfamiliar topics and further educate themselves. This small, but important change in the project designer completely decides whether a student will go on with a solid understanding of the class or forget the only half of the material that they learned.\n \n Although one could argue that student-designed summer assignment have their own benefits the better option are teacher-designed assignments. These summer projects are better structured because the teachers have received and education on how to teach adolescents, they understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about. This structure is also beneficial because it doesn't allow the student to create anything that isn't challenging and even makes it easier on the teacher with grading. For these reasons, summer assignments should be designed by teachers and not the students.",

      "Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively.\n \n If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling. I would go onto a website that was used for teaching people from K-12th grade everything that they would need to know. I would do this from when I was taken out of school to the first year of middle school, and my knowledge and understanding of the subjects that we were learning was at the point were I wasn't the oddÂ ball in the class. With that part of the year and during the summer when not only was I able to catch up in subjects that I was a few grades lower in, but I was a level higher then everyone else for a while.\n \n With teachers designing the summer project then students don't have to worry about it as much because they don't have to waste the time deciding what to do for the project all summer. Not only would the students be given a benefit from using the knowledge given to them, but they also get to finish it in almost half the time that they would have needed if they were to choose the project as well. There are a lot of friends that I know who can't decide on a certain subject for a project until it is either the night before it is due or the day off. They are very stressed out when this happens which leads to them failing in other classes as the extra stress from that one class is distracting them from the others.\n \n Another benefit is that the student actually has to go out of their comfort zone, or they will stay in it, if the subject or the needed information is in a subject/ topic they like or dislike. Forcing a student to work on something that they don't understand is something that could help them understand it, and as they have to get a understanding before they can use it or they will not understand it and never get any better on the subject; making the student more creative in their methods for learning and for when they overcome harder challenges in life. For Example, they might get into a rut at a job that they have and it is getting difficult to keep going. Well if they are creative thinkers then an idea might pop into their head which could lead to them getting out of the rut and to a much happier life.\n \n In conclusion, then if a teacher either from the last year or the next year will be able to help the students understanding grow. Although, some people think that the teacher shouldn't be the one to design it, but in fact the student, because it gives them a free choice on what to do, they have more fun doing it as it might be a subject they are interested in, and they might be able to grow in their field of experiences that interests them. It still could lead to students not doing the summer project at all because they might not be able to decide until the very last moment or not at all. If a teacher or teachers design the summer project then their is a lower chance that the student will forget information from the last year. Along with, the project being a challenge that could benefit both the student and the future teachers in the long term, with the student having a better understanding of the subject and/or the concept.",

      "Should school required summer projects be designed by the teacher or the student? I say it should be designed by the student. If the student designs the project, it allows the student to show the teacher what they have learned. This could also help teach students good life skills for later in their lives. Having a teacher design the project, takes away the chance for a student to learn how to be independent. So, students should be in charge of designing their summer projects, because of life lessons they could learn.\n \n If the student does the designing for the project, they can show the teacher what they have learned in their classes. This will also allow the teacher to see what they need to work on more with their students. This being said, it also allows the student to understand what they need to focus on more when learning. If the teacher designs it, the student wouldn't be able to learn as much on what they know or don't know. Thus, it opens up ideas for students to do the project on, and understand why they couldn't do something because they weren't fully understanding one idea, or many.\n \n A great life lesson this summer project can teach the students is how to be independent, reliable, and responsible. It's a great way for the student to be ready for when they graduate school and need to learn how to plan for the future for themselves. If the teacher designs this project, they would be taking away the opportunity for the student to learn a great life skills. This being, students have a better chance of learning more from designing the project, then having their teacher designs it for them.\n \n Having a teacher design the project would not be as beneficial for the student as it would be if the students designed it. This is a chance for the students to learn how to work on time management. Being able to work on time management for the project allows the student to work on planing for when they should be at a milestone of the project. This allows the students to be more self-efficient for working. This helps them learn how to work on the project better and be able to complete the project knowing that they designed it, and worked on it without having someone tell them what to do. This will help build self-confidence in the students and have them be able to complete a task more efficient when they do it.\n \n Having students design their summer projects for school is a good idea. It has them showing their teacher what they have learned. Also have them learning life skills/lessons from this project. The students can also learn time management, and learn how to be more self-confident and more self-efficient. All of these lessons or skills help a student learn, and demonstrate to their teacher what good of a worker they are, when the student designs the project.",

    Essay:
      "Should teachers or students be the ones creating designing the summer projects?Â Summer projects are created to help the students better retain the information from the previous school year.Â On one hand the students might want to design the project based on what they want to do, and on the other hand the teacher might want to design the project to make sure that the students study what they are meant to. I say the teachers should be the ones that are in charge of designing the summer projects for students because, the the teachers could keep the curriculum well rounded, in the be much easier for the teachers and the students to follow the rubric while either grading or working, and if need be teachers could alter or personalize the projects to better suit an individuals or groups lack of knowledge of a specific unit.\n \n If teachers were the ones designing the summer projects than they could put a little bit of everything from the previous years curriculum. Students who already know one subject extremely well wouldn't be able to just do the entire summer project on that an forget the rest of it. Students would retain the information much better if the projects weren't focused on just one subject but all of them. They would recall the material as they worke on small portions of the units in the projects. Coming the next the students would be better prepared to continue learning new material.\n \n If teachers were to design the projects they would be able to creat a rubric. Students who had to work on the projects could then better follow exactly what they were supposed to complete and review. The project would be easier to finish if they had a rubric to check to see if they were on the right track. Once the summer project is due and turned in to the teacher, the grading process would be quicker and easier. The teacher could check off sections of the rubric to see if a student did a part correct or not. The grading would be done faster so the teacher could move on to more inmortant things like the current school year.\n \n Say a student was strugling in a couple subjects of the material from the previous year. A teacher could design the summer project to better help the student learn the information to move on the next school year. The teacher could even put different people into groups in order for the students to learn together and figure out the problems by themselves for better information retention.\n \n Teachers designing summer projects would help the summer projects stay well balanced in the information, easier for the both the students and the teachers, and better for peronalized learning for the students. Summer projects are meant for the students to learn and recall the material so why not give students the best learning experuence while doing it. For a project to be easier and much more helpful goes a long way in helping a student succeed. Isn't that what the summer project is all about?Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete projects during summer break. Teachers do this so that students don't become lazy when they return to school and it keeps their brains working. Doing projects during summer break will ensure that all students keep using their brains and don't just \"turn them off.\" Projects should be teacher-designed because the projects won't be off topic, and the criteria will be correct; even though, students will be more interested in the work if they could create it.\n \n First, the project won't be off topic if it's created by a teacher. The teachers know what students need to be taught before graduation and can make sure the project benefits the students. Doing this, students may get to graduate sooner if the projects cover what could be taught in a classroom. With the teachers creating the projects, they can ensure that the students are learning what needs to be learned and there are no mistakes.\n \n Secondly, all the criteria in the project will be correct. Teachers are more experienced in creating work for the students; therefore, the projects will be challenging enough to keep students brains working and it will all be correct. Students would have a hard time trying to come up with a project and having to create it all at the same time. It would be less challenging for the kids and less stressful for the teachers.\n \n However, with students making the projects this will ensure that the students will be more interested in the topics. Students will be more inclined to do the work if it's something they like and can choose. People would complete more work doing something they like. With that, teachers may see a rise in grades if students can complete something that is in their best interest.\n \n Lastly, projects should be teacher-designed because the projects won't be off topic, and the criteria will be correct; even though, students will be more interested in work if they could create it. If students have to do work during summer break, then they have to make sure that it is beneficial. Teachers should create them so that all the projects help each individual. Projects are insured that they're beneficial and helpful if a higher authority creates them.Â",

      "Students take their summer break to relax and have fun, but others will have a few projects to complete before school starts again. Many schools in the country will require students to complete summer projects, they want to ensure that students are still learning over break. I believe that these summer projects should be student designed because it allows them to be creative, they can pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like.\n \n Having students design their projects will allow them to be creative, many students would not enjoy the project as much if the teacher has a set design on how the project will be. Students would not be eager to do it and delay the assignment waiting till last minute to start it; allowing them to have full creative ability will produce incredible work. Students can express artistic ability with their work allowing them to draw pictures, use different mediums, lavish colors, and think of creative designs. Just giving them that freedom could make the assignment exciting instead of feeling like a chore they are forced to do.\n \n Students can pick topics they are interested in allowing them to enjoy the project. If the teacher assigns a topic students are not interested in, it would not be an enjoyable time. The students would not be motivated to do research on the topic, they would push off on the assignment, and be completely unaware of important facts in their topic. By allowing them to chose any topic it would make learning fun, a student can be fascinated by a topic but never had the opportunity to thoroughlyÂ research it and this would be the chance. The research they would do may mean a lot to them, it could be a future occupation they want to be helping them learn the requirements needed for specific facilities, schools, and how much money they would make. It could also allow for students to be informed on a topic they do not know much about and would like to be knowledgeable in a certain field. Having students chose would be an incredible opportunity to learn.\n \n Lastly, students are able to do the projects how they would like to do it. Having the teacher decide how the project will be set up may be underwhelming for students or difficult to set up. By allowing them to chose how to do their project will result in creative ideas and make the project less difficult. Some students may want to do something else than a regular PowerPoint, they could make a book filled with all the information needed and they can draw pictures. Maybe they want to do videography, they could film a music video or a short film with a script and actors. Also by allowing them to chose it could create less pressure for the students, there are many sites that have layouts and videos guiding them with their project. If they are not able to do it how the teacher wants it they cannot ask them for help they are over break and could not have the teacher's contact information.\n \n The summer projects are a great way to assure students are still learning over break but allowing the students to design their projects would be an incredible opportunity for them to be creative, pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like. I believe this would be a good opportunity for schools and students to keep learning even over their break and encourage them to always be knowledgeableÂ  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "I am very on board with the idea that student projects enhance learning throughout the summer , but should the student projects be chosen but the students or by teachers ?\n \n After extensive thought I believe they should be chosen by the students , but should have a firm rubrick and expectations on how to get full credit for completion of the project.\n \n The thought behind student projects is to help the children continue learning even throughout the summer, so you want to make the project something cool that will make all kids even with different intrest, intrested enough that they will want to complete the project. I feel like if the teachers pick what the project should be about there will still be students who are not intrested enough to even bother completing it and they will see a sharp decline in the amount of students willing to complete a student project.\n \n Now that being said i feel that there is a fine line between school appropriate projects and projects that are not. Students should not only be provided with a sheet that gives prompt ideas and lists what does meet project guidelines as well as a list of things that will result in a loss of points on the project. There are many things a student can come up with such as a photography journal with a paragraph beside each photograph explaining the significance of the Photo , or someone who loves astronomy completing a model solar system with why each planet is suitable or not suitable for life. Give them the option the express themselves through these projects not just throw something together because they want a grade.\n \n I can also see the other side where people say that it should be teacher chosen so that they can provide detailed expectations of how the project should be completed , but you have to see that in a class of twenty or thirty students not all students are intrested in the same things. It will make the student who is not intrested feel left out when they see other people so excited to complete a project that they are gonna wait until the last night of summer and throw something together because it is not something they like. Consider all of the different personality types ? You cant have a one size fits all project because there will always be someone who it does not actually fit .\n \n Thank you so much for allowing me to express my opinion in this paper. I am very aware that not everyone will have the same one as me but i do hope my argument made sense .",

      'Should summer projects be student-designed? In my opinion, yes; I feel as though summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to express their creativity and have the freedom to think outside the box, rather than be held back of their ideas and inner thoughts. On the other hand, teachers also feel as though that they should be allowed to give specific project topics or ideas to their students, instead of students creatively thinking for themselves due to a lack of performance in the classroom. Though, teachers believe summer projects should be designed through their ideas due to poor performance in the classroom, students should be given a chance to express themselves and the freedom to create their own projects.\n \n As a student, summer break is supposed to be a time to get away from school, classwork, homework, and a time to relax. However, in other schools; learning never stops. Due to schools wanting kids to learn during summer vacation, students are given summer projects to keep them focused. All students around different schools believe that having the chance to create things using their ideas will enhanceÂ their learning experience. Also, students feel as though that teachers are more in tune of what the students feel or want, rather than give them an assignment that doesn\'t appeal to them as much. Furthermore, I; myself as a student has had the chance to receive student-designed projects and to me, it\'s one of the greatest things not only for me, but for my classmates as well; it allows us to show our ability in what we know how to do and how well do we understand the topic we choose in exchange for a good grade.\n \n In other cases, there are teachers who believe that classroom performance can play a roll in students receiving teacher-designed projects during the summer. Some teachers disagree in allowing a class to behave poorly or set low expectations for each other and give them an assignment that will be "fun" or "enjoyable" to please students. Other teachers for instance, think that students need to challenge themselves more in class and not settle for a decent grade, instead; elevate their work ethic to a greater amount for the grade they worked for. However, teachers will also give assignments just based on lesson plans or things they truly believe is what needs to be focused on and assigned to the students.\n \n In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to have projects designed by them to see what they know, showcase their ability of creating a unique topic that\'s original, and allow teachers to see what students can do on their own, than seek guidance to have a plannedÂ project assigned to them.',

      "During the Summer students are not concerned about learningÂ , students are more focused on watching Netflix or going swimming with friends. In order to help with influencing students to continue learning throughout break, most schools assign students mandatory projects to work on during Summer break. Although some believe that Summer projects should be student - designed due to student- designed projects being easier. Others believe that Summer projects should be teacher - designed because, teachers are more professional when it comes to choosing classwork, students would become stressed out, and choosing assignments is not anyÂ student's responsibility. For instance, since Summer projects are not optional students would appreciate the projects being teacher- designed in order to feel more motivated to learn.\n \n For starters,Â teachers are more professional when it comes to choosing classwork , because teachers know that procrastinating is not an option when it comes to learning. If the projects were student- designed then students would most likely put the assignment off until last minute or just decide to complete the assignment without any effort. For example, students would not take the assignment as seriously because of the amount of work required in choosing an assignment. Students would most likely decide to sleep in or hangout with friends instead of doing research and picking a decent topic. If teachers designed the projects then students would have topics available to them instead of having to do extra research and work.\n \n Secondly school is stressful to begin with , and having to work on a project over the Summer is not something most students want to do. In order for students to feel less stressed out, teachers should make sure that they choose topics that would suit student's interests. Students would feel less stressed because they would have good examples for the projects. For example, a teacher could instead chose a less complicated topic such as a list of role- models from the past. When the list is handed to the students , the students would not have to worry about stressing about finding a certain topic. Students could just pick a person that seems interesting from the list then decide how many hours in a day they would spend researching that certain person.\n \n Lastly, choosing assignments is not the student's responsibility. Teachers are responsible for assigning students their classwork. When classwork is not optional students should not have to deal with extra work that is supposed to be a teacher's responsibility. For example, teachers assigning students to design the projects is unessecary and students would be less motivated to complete their projects sooner due to the amount of work. Teachers should be the ones to make sure student's have learned and when student's have more work than needed , students will least likely learn as much due to rushing through the projects.\n \n Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers are professional, students should not have to feel stressed during break, and teachers are responsible for choosing assignments. Teachers are responsible for helping students to learn until they are fully independent and have enough knowledge on their own. Â Â Â",

      "Summer is the best time of the year and when the final bell of the school year sounds everyone jumps for joy for the three month long break. Summer gives students a break from nine months of hard work, tests, projects, and homework. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. Summer projects should not have to be a punishment or torture; therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to pick a topic they want to learn about, it makes it that students are more interested and driven to do research and learn new information, and it also enhances students to show their creativeness.\n \n Student-designed projects allow for a student to choose any topic they want. If I had to do a summer project I would want to pick my own topic to learn about. I once had a summer assignment where the teacher gave us all the information and said to turn it in on the first day. The topic was not only boring, but it didnt make me learn because I ended up dropping out of the class due to the lack of interest in the subject. Students should be able to design a project based on a topic they want because it creates a better working environment when you do something you want to do versus being given something you dont want to do and told to do it. In result, all projects should be self chosen and not teacher chosen because of the drive to learn about something that entices an individual.\n \n Student-designed projects would increase the interest level of learning and result in more passion and drive to learn. Not only would students learn more, they would get better grades on these projects because they would be more passionate about it due to being interested in the subject. I play baseball, and I know for a fact that if someone said to complete a project on any sport you want to I would be more excited than if someone gave me a sport like soccer that I wasnt interested in. This would promote better research, resulting in better grades and a higher level of learning. Being interested and passionate about a topic would also enhance one's creativity o a project.\n \n Being creative on a project is a big part of most rubrics and in order to get a good grade one most show some sort of creativeness. Student-designed projects allow for the most amount of creativeness because you have free reign on what you want to do. Designs given by the teacher are structured and don'tÂ fully allow for the creator to show his or her way of expressing a topic through creative things like color, picture, words, etc. Student chosen projects provide a one-hundred percent option for anything you want to include.\n \n AlthoughÂ teacher-designed summer projects provide a structured layout and a related topic the class, they dont allow for students to be interested and driven in a subject of their choice and to have the ability to put anything they want to in their project. Summer is a time of rest and teacher-designed projects cause stress and anxiety; however, student-designed projects allow for a student to be calm knowing that they are doing something they want to do and not doing something they have to do. Student-designed projects benefits and enables students to open learning during the best three months of the year. Â Â Â",

      "Are students given enough freedom in school classrooms? Students attend school for approximately 180 days each school year. However, the work does not stop just because summer break begins. Teachers often assign specific projects to students at the end of each school year for them to complete by the time they go back to school in the fall. These projects can include reading a book, writing an essay, or completing worksheets. While some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more freedom, it is best for teachers to design these projects because they know what will benefit students the most and it is less inconvenient for teachers and students.\n \n Teachers only assign students work that they know will benefit the students. Students may view summer projects as useless, extra work, but teachers always have reasons for assigning assignments. Many teachers' reasons for assigning summer projects is to prepare students for the following school-year. A vast majority of schools offer advanced placement courses which are very challenging and rigorous classes. In order to give students an introduction to what the class is like, teachers often assign summer projects. This helps the students in the long-run because they are given exposure to the course ahead of time.\n \n Having student-designed projects is too much of a hassle for teachers and students. Adopting student-designed projects would require each individual student to brainstorm ideas for their summer project. Not only does it take even more time out of students' summer lives, but it also creates more work for teachers. If each student were to design their own project, teachers would have to grade each project using a different set of eyes. Each project would be unique, meaning teachers would not be able to use the same set of standards for all projects. Without having a standard list of requirement, students would not know if their project met the requirements and it would take teachers forever to grade the projects. Having one uniform assignment for all students would relieve much stress from teachers' and students' lives.\n \n Some may argue that student-designed projects give students more freedom. Each student is creative in their own way and some may say that students are not given enough opportunities to utilize their creativity in school. Allowing students to design their summer projectsÂ would make it more enjoyable while also still learning. However, students do not always do things that are in their best interest. Instead, they take the easy-way-out.\n \n Overall, it is in everyone's best interest to have teacher-designed summer projects. It creates less stress for teachers, and it prepares students for the next school year. Students are given freedom in the classroom in many other ways, and adding student-designed projects would make classrooms even less structured. Teacher-designed projects are beneficial to both teachers and students, and they should be used in all classrooms.",

      "School just got out and the students finally have time to relax. They realize there is school later in the year, but forget about that, it's summer. In order to keep the students mentally sharp for the upcoming school year, they are given medial and mundane tasks over the summer to make sure they can continue to perform at the top of their game. Students often complain about how boring the assignment is, and they have a point;the summer assignments are often way too specific or require an immense amount of creativity to put together coherently. The task of summer projects is to continue learning even when school is out and thus the job to design the summer assignment should be in the hands of the teachers.\n \n Although students would perform better if the summer assignment topic was something a little more relevant, the point is to learn and maintain a standard. If students could teach themselves, then there would be no purpose of going to school. A trend currently is the degradation of students and their worsening grades. If those same students were given the choice to either write a teacher's prompt or their own prompt, all of them would write a terrible paper. There would be no incentive to trying as the student can write about a topic that is nonsense and get away with it. Teachers direct and guide students to learning new things, and they set the standard for the years to come.\n \n Students are fed up with school at the end of year, and now they have the free time to do anything they so wish. Their brains are not in the growing mindset;instead, they are thinking about the next parties or road trips. A student designing an assignment in their head might sound good to them, but in reality, it tends to turn out very poorly structured or lazily written. Students cannot be held accountable to remember every single detail of a particular class to be able to design an assignment especially in the midst of their summer fun.\n \n The last reason that teachers should design summer assignments is grading them. They understand what the assignment should roughly be about. They know the differences of a terrible, average, or great paper. It would be impossible to fairly grade students if they all submit completely random and baseless papers that are not comparable to each other. The teacher should assign something that allows all the paper to have a consistent threat throughout the paper. Having all the students connected to a single topic helps prevent students from going off the rails on their assignment later on.\n \n Overall, those that can teach in school should be able to design something to teach outside of school. Education is not about the satisfaction the student can derive from it, but the brutal reality of how well they can understand. With more students failing, it is the teacher's job to raise the bar and help those students work to get there. Lowering the bar creates a positive feed cycle;students will become worse and worse as the amount of effort required plummets. Teachers should design the assignments that best suit their students strengths.",

      "Summer assignments are one of the aspects of summer break that students dread the most. It can make your Summer go from one hundred to zero really quickly, especially if it's late August and you just remembered it. Students dread it because it's so tedious and time consuming that it's less of a learning experience and more of a back breaking chore. Although, if they were made by students it would be a different story. Summer assignments should be assigned and designed by students and for students because otherwise they can be jarring and time consuming. Also if students were to make them, then it could touch more students on a personal level and have more creativity.\n \n Summer assignments can feel repetitive and boring when some teachers assign it, especially reading assignments. It often boils down to the same formula: Read or research a book or topic, write an essay, make a connection, and sometimes something interesting is thrown in if you're lucky. Students most likely dislike doing it because it gives them nothing but a dry and lifeless \"challenge\", headaches, and wasted time for a grade. Also, a lot of teachers mistake challenge for difficulty when they are two vastly different things. Something can be challenging and easy, which is what summerÂ assignmentsÂ should be. They aren't hard or challenging in any way, it's just annoying. Additionally, the books are often chosen for you instead of finding one yourself, and even that's a gamble because you don't know if you'll like the book or not. Which makes the connection part harder because you may not connect with a single character in the book.\n \n Students understand the pain and strife of other students, be itÂ hard work, strict teachers, tight deadlines, or all of the above. What they also have a better understanding in, is that students don't want to spend a month, sometimes two, of their break doing research on a topic they don't care that much about. As well as they don't want to read a book in it's entirety that they didn't choose. So naturally they'll bring far more practical and interactive ideas to the table. Such as having them read from a genre of their choosing, or maybe having them analyze a movie or poem, or just having them do a project on an issue that affects them. It'll keep the same purpose of the summer assignment, keeping you working and educated while you're out of school, while making the whole experience less painful and tedious to go through.\n \n Something that people might think when it comes to students making the assignments is they might make it too simple, thus making it ineffective. As well as the point of the boring books is to help students widen their vocabulary or show them . But, there are many ways to better someone's vocabulary than to thrust a four hundred plus page book onto them. Such as using a shorter book, maybe let them broaden it on their own fruition etc. Also, it is possible that there may be someone trying to help the others get out of jail free by giving them a low effort assignment. But, an easy way to fix that is to have a group of students rather than just one or a couple, then they could all vote and see which idea would benefit the most people. Furthermore, an easy assignment that students will enjoy and have fun with as they work is far better than a \"hard\" assignment that no one will enjoy.\n \n There's nothing wrong with the idea of summer assignments on paper, but in practice it falls way short. But students can provide other students with a fun and truly challenging way without the hassle of bogus material. Naturally, this seems like a far fetchedÂ idea, having students assign any kind of assignments, but it might not be so bad if we just give it a try. Who knows, maybe the students will feel more inclined to do their work if they weren't getting the same thing every year.",

Students lose their free timeÂ trying to figure out what to do and how to complete the work the teachers give to them, and we can't ask for help and get it like we would in school so most students struggle on trying to complete it the way the teachers want it done. I believe the students should come up with the project design because we can complete it faster, the work would be better to the teachers to look at cause it'll be different ideas from each student.\n \n Since they can complete the work their way it can give them more time to themselves, family, and friends instead of trying to think on how to finish the work. They can struggle on the same part since they out with family and constantly doing something and not giving them time to complete it. Since teachers usually be so strict on how to get the work done then it can cause stress on the students and could mess up their whole break trying to finish it or just make them not even want to do any of it. But the better the student can make the project for themselves the more work they can get done faster than a whole different design.\n \n Another thing is on how it can be better work cause of the different ideas. Plenty of families go on vacationÂ to different places with their kids or go to different places doing fun things, and since that could take up most of the time they can just do it based on what they have done that break. Some teachers want to hear about what their students did during that summer, and the different ideas from the students can make the teacher have something entertaining to read or see other than looking at the same thing over and over at the beginning of the year. The way the students think too can change how good the project turn out to be and can be something fun for the students to work on too and can change how their school year begin.\n \n If they schools allow students to design their own projects it can really turn out better on everybody and give them more time to enjoy their break and even though we could come up with it we can still learn new things while working on it, planning on how to work on it, or after completing it.

I believe school summer projects should be consistent and always be designed by a teacher because it creates an equal learning objective, strong motivation from a teacher, and help and guidance on making sure a project is done correctly.\n \n With student deigned projects, students often do not meet their set learning objective of their class. Some students gain the objective and learn,but some fail and do not meet the objective because they learn a different topic. Because of this, students should follow a teacher designed project to create an equal learning environment, ensuring all students learn the same learning material. Summer projects are meant to help students continue learning during a break, without a certain objective being designed by a teacher, students often will no achieve the meaning of a summer project.\n \n Over a long break, many students do not have strong motivation to complete and learn a project. Whether it is because a student is confused or doesn't have good management,Â Students often find themselves in need of greater help from teachers as a way to successfully learn from a project. In school, teachers are often seen as great influences in the classroom, ensuring greatness from each and every student. However, at home, students often are not kept at the same standards of learning. With teacher designed projects, this would create a vast way for students to become motivated and successful, in order to follow their teachers project.\n \n Help is often hard to find at home. Many students do not have great resources at home. For example, parents often cannot answer questions about a school project, due to their lack of knowledge of the classroom. With a teacher being the designer for a school summer project, students have a reliable resource for help on what to do. This guidance from a reliable resource makes summer project much easier for a student, as they would have a teacher to help them succeed in a set project.\n \n While teacher-designed projects have set rules and can be seen as useful, student-designed projects can also be seen as helpful, as they can give a student freedom on what to do and how to do it. Student-designed projects do not hold a student back from doing a project a certain way, as every student learns differently. However, I still believe all summer projects should be designed by a teacher to assure great continual learning during a break. Teacher-deigned projects create a strong learning objective, a great source of motivation, and strong help and guidance for all students to follow.Â",

    Essay:
      "When it comes to talking about choosing between a project over summer break, should it be where the student can choose their own design, or where the project is designed by the teacher.\n \n I think that if a school has a summer project it should be student-designed, so that the student will want to do the project over summer.\n \n When a student does something one does not like; one does not usually rememberÂ doing the project when one needs to present in class.\n \n If a student can have a choice of any subject to do a project as long as school appriorate over summer the one can enjoy and choose; also will make students more energetic to complete the project on time.\n \n Students should be able to design their own projects because the students will be able to express their feelings, emotions, and inner thoughts.\n \n When students usually start working a design made by them they start with how the feel in the moment and how they have felt in the past.\n \n The first thing that starts to show when a student is working on a design made by them is one's feelings towards the subject that the student's is working on.\n \n When someone expresses their feelings in this way one puts a lotÂ of effort into the project and will make the project really show and really speak.\n \n Mainly because it is a reflection of how the student's feelings are shown on the subject for the project.\n \n Also when a student tends to show one's feelings it tends to make the student work and be more positive and happy.\n \n The reason being the student is able to do something they like and not being forced to do something they do not like.\n \n When students are working on a design that is their choice and the student is working with one's feeling on a subject the students true emotions start to show.\n \n When it comes to the second thing, the student starts to add their emotion about the subject deep down and how their emotions are truly.\n \n When a student shows their emotions one wants to be heard in a positive way; if the student has a choice to design a project on a subject student's choice the student tends to be happier and is will to work on the project.\n \n Meaning the student is not upset when they are forced to do a project over break because they get to choose and show their own emotions on the subject that the student chooses.\n \n When it comes to choosing between a teacher most likely making the project based on book work, or the student enjoying summer doing a project that the student designed.\n \n Also the student would be able to work with either a friend, or a family member.\n \n When a student starts to show one's feelings and emotions towards a subject of the students choice, the student tends to start to show their true thoughts towards the subject by choice.\n \n The third thing that shows the most when a student designs their own project over summer it will show their true inner thought on the project that the student is designing.\n \n When a student starts to show their true inner thought on a project; one tends to be more vocal on the subject the designed because it is how they really feel deep down.\n \n Meaning when one starts to talk about their own thought; they talk in a more positive direction and try to be more friendly because the student wants someone to listen.\n \n Also when students are talking about their opinion; the students get a chance to express how they feel inside.\n \n Mainly because in today world students do not have a say on how the schools are run and the students should be able to choose their own design.\n \n When talking about student-designed projects and teacher-designed projects people needs to talk about both sides, teacher-designed projects can be fun and helpful to learn from also to teach with.\n \n When talking about teacher-designed projects, people need to also realize some students are not capableÂ enough to create their own design and needs a teacher-designed project instead of a student-designed project.\n \n When talking about projects designed by teachers for over summer; some of the projects are fun and exciting, but some are just book work and studying.\n \n Mainly because the students should be entertained by what they are learning and being able to learn something from the project.\n \n When mentioned a minute ago, teacher-designed projects can be helpful in the meaning of learning how to grow plants, or learning the chemical reaction in putting mentos and coca-cola.\n \n The reason being some students when they grow up want to be a gardener and some want to be scientists.\n \n The main thing is that students should be able to choose their own design for their projects during break because it is the students own time and they should be able to express their own feelings towards subjects they like.\n \n When it comes to talking about teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects, people have to remember that everyone should have a choice on the work they have to do during their own break.\n \n When a student makes a choice on what they have to do over break is based of how they feelings about the topic at the time.\n \n Also when a student works on their own design they tend to start putting more emotion into the design because they chose what they wanted to do.\n \n Mainly, but most of all, when a student works on a subject the students share their inner thoughts with the world.\n \n Students should be able and be capable to design their own projects and choose the subject so they can express how they really feel deep down about the subjects so they can talk about how they feel.\n \n When wondering which side to take both are good but there has to be a choice either teacher-designed projects over summer break, or student-designed projects over break.",

    Essay:
      "Do you believe if students designed their own summer projects, they would benefit from it ? Well 75 percent of students often slack when it comes to doing projects on their own spare time. Students tend to lose interest when it comes to school work, you can only imagine how it would feel for them to create a whole project! I believe summer projects should be designed by teachers, because some students are easily distracted,lazy, and careless. Teachers have a more experienced mindset than students,and are way more educated. With all the work these students have to do during summer, having to design a project would just be to overwhelming.\n \n Firstly, teachers are highly experienced when it comes to school projects. Having experience means a lot when you are a teacher, you would have the right amount of education needed for students. Teachers would know exactly how to set up a project and the right steps to require during the project. For example, some students do not know how to complete a project. The experience teachers have gained over the years would play its affects, and benefit the students rather he/she doing so themselves. Teachers would know exactly what to mention in their project to assure students will learn over the summer.\n \n Secondly, summer is a time for students to relax, get comfortable, and enjoy their break. Some students would already have tons of work to complete, having to design a project would just put the icing on the cake for them. At the end of the day students are just kids, after finishing two semesters of school they just need a time off. With a limited time to complete all these assignments, some students might not make the deadline. With all the work these students have to do during the summer; they would be extremely exhausted.\n \n Also, students often get distracted easily. Summer has a lot of distractions around,friends,electronics, and even sports. To many distractions can cause a student to be irresponsible. With no parental guidance around all the time, the thought of designing the project will probably slip the students mind. If teachers designed the project, they could remind the student and the parent ahead of time, and they would be able to complete it.\n \n In addition, some might argue and say if students complete assignments on their own; they would remember the information more. I disagree some students would complete a assignment not knowing anything going on about it. If a teacher designs a project, students would actually have to do some work, instead of writing anything down on a piece of paper and calling it a day. Students would have to remember what they learned and present it to the teacher, which assures they continued to learn throughout their break.\n \n In conclusion, summer is students break time. With everything going on during summer students might not find the time to design a project, but if teachers designed it for them, their would be a big load off their backs. It takes a lot of work to design a project. Students minds will already be overwhelmed of so much work they already have to complete. Why throw another assignment on them?Â",

      "If teachers set guidelines and standards for how they want their students projects to look, then their students would put more effort and energy into fulfilling those standards and guidelines. Student would be more efficient in order to accomplish what the project should be and what the project should actually look like to the teacher.\n \n However to some students it may be better to design a project based off of how they would want the project to look and how they want their project setup instead of what teacher would want. This would give the teacher the opportunity to see what the student is capable of doing on their own. This option would represent what the students have actually learned over their break. It also will reflect how the students take it upon themselves to show what they know in a creative way based off of the projects topic.\n \n However, student-designed projects would lead to some students not putting as much effort and creativity in their projects. Students will do the bare-minimum when they have the option to take it upon themselves to do an assignment for school. Some students may take it upon themselves to go above and beyond for their student-designed project. However some students may take advantage and use it as an opportunity to be lazy and unproductive on this assignment.\n \n Students would not have as much motivation if they have the option to take it upon themselves to create a project over their summer break. If this assignment was left up to students to design their own projects some would not take it as serious as should and some would. The students who won't take it as serious as they should would have an unorganized project or they just wouldn't do the project at all.\n \n A benefit of summer projects being teacher-designed would be the fact that all students had one layout or structure for how their projects are supposed to be. It would be easier for the teachers to grade and look over all projects efficiently. It would also be easier for the students to follow an assigned rubric or setup for a project. Instead of designing it on their own\n \n Teacher-designed project would be easier for students because they know what the teacher expects their project to be like in order to get a good grade on it. This will make the students projects way more neat and organized. Therefore summer break projects should be teacher-designed to be more efficient, organized, and helpful for both students and teachers",

      "Imagine the world if students didn't complete summer projects. Students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break that the school required. Summer projects is like a homework that is given to students during their break. Summer break is a two months break from school it is also the longest break that a student have. School is a place where a student can learn new things in order to get a diploma to have a job in the future. Schools shouldn't require students to complete summer projects during their break because students will be more lazy to go to school, no one will do it, and students will forget everything.\n \n Certainly, some people believe that schools should require students to complete summer projects because they don't do anything during their break. During summer break some students only play video games and sleep. Others may think that students needs to be prepared for the next school year. So that the students will be more advance and the topics that they're gonna learn wouldn't be hard for them. Still others may think that students needs to learn more new things during their break. These people are wrong.\n \n Schools shouldn't require students to complete summer project; students will be more lazy to go to school. Teenagers are already tired of school if school board made them do some summer projects they're giving them a reason why students doesn't like going to school. Do students like to go to school nor do students like to do homework. Homework is one of the main reason why students doesn't like going to school. Teachers make a hard homework. Giving students a project during summer break is too much work for them because they already done a lot of work during their school year. People need a break from everything. Youngsters don't have time for summer projects because they are working during summer break to save money for college. Summer break is the only time they can work for a long hours to save money and to help their family to pay their bills. Working for the long hours during school year will be hard for a students especially if they doesn't know how to multitask. Sometimes too much is bad for people's health; they can harm to a person emotionally and mentally. Emotionally because they will have no time for their families; mentally because they didn't have a chance to have a brain break that can lead them to depression.\n \n School Board shouldn't require students to do a summer project because no one will do it. Students are busy during summer break. Some students spend time with their family because they don't have time during their school year. During school year students are really busy especially those who are in colleges; summer break is the only time they can go home to their families. When students go home to their family most of them go on vacations. Vacation is what all people need to avoid depression from school. If schools give students a projects during their summer break, then students will not enjoy their vacation. Teenagers will feel more frustrated. Students got no time for their selves to relax and enjoy the peaceful environment unlike the school. The environment at school are really depressing and stressful. If school required students to do projects at home they will feel the exact same thing how they feel about school. People needs a break from school and everyone needs a rest.\n \n School shouldn't require students to do a project during their summer breaks because they will just forget everything they done. Students can finish their project for only just a week. People just want to finish their work without learning it. Finishing work without learning it doesn't make any sense because schools give students or teachers summer projects to get ready for the next school year. Students doesn't even used what they learned they just do it for the grade. Summer break is a very long break for a students if school give students a work to do they will just forget what they've learned. People do a lot of things during summer break. Going on a vacation is the first reason why students forget everything because that is their only time to relax were you can release all the things that makes a people stress. The thing that makes people stress are the test, homework,project,and school environment. School projects make people stress because students doesn't like doing a lot of work. Students always over think even tho it is just a simple problem. Over thinking is one of the bad habit that a person have because everyone does this.\n \n Schools shouldn't give students a projectÂ during summer break because no on will do it, students will forget everything, and they will be more lazy to go to school. If school didn't give students a projects during summer break, then students can save money and can relax their mind from school.",

    Essay:
      "Summer is a time period students dream about throughout the school year. It is the promise of complete freedom from the academic cycle they grow exhausted of over time. While summer project assignments may be dreaded by some to inhibit them during their months of freedom, these assignments have the long termÂ benefit of continuing to engage student minds. Teacher-designed summer projects guide students to continue learning effective content based on the educators' experience, and though more demanding than student-designed projects, ultimately prepares them for the future.\n \n Unlike students, who have no experience in teaching a course, teachers have the knowledge to assign projects that not only directly relate to the classwork, but specifically assist students in mentally preparing for the rigor and content of the coming year. Teachers have firsthand experience in assigning projects, as well as knowledge gained through formal training to receive their teaching certification. Specifically, they know how their class will be lead and therefore have the deepest understanding of what content would be most effectively to learn or review over the summer. The time students spend on teacher-designed summer projects would assist their position in the class even before the academic year has begun. Oppositely, student-designed projects have the potential issue of being mere busy work, meant to be simple to complete yet not informed by the actual course, and subsequently a poor use of students' time and effort. Teacher-designed summer projects are guaranteed to be effective in enhancing student learning, as they are lead by the educators themselves.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects have the educational advantage of being assigned directly by the leader of the course. This then gives students the advantage of getting to know their future teacher's expectations for the class and the content they are expected to know. This may lead to lessened student anxiety surrounding beginning a new school year by providing them with a sample of coursework. Summer projects may involve a rubric for scoring, as they often do for academic year assignments. This allows students to have teacher expectations written out for them so that they can mentally prepare for the coming year at their own pace. Summer projects designed by teachers may also mirror an assessment that will be given the first week or two of school. A practice test, for instance, gives students firsthand experience in what questions will be asked. This knowledge of the class, direct from the educator, provides students with concrete practice and will lower stress surrounding the unknown of the coming academic year.\n \n Summer projects designed by teachers are likely to be more intensive than student-driven projects. But this prepares students for the reality of their futures, in which they must independently weigh work, leisure, and socialization to reach a balance for contentment and success. Students and parents may be concerned about the potential inundation of schoolwork during the promised free period of summer break. Yet, the promise of months of vacation from work is not reflective of students' lives after graduation. In the workforce, much more often then not vacations are not guaranteed. Vacation days must be earned or built up over time, and the employee must additionally consider the effect of losing that time at their occupation. The working world, the adult world, does not slow in the summer. Teachers, understanding the scope of their courses, will tailor summer projects to be educationally effective, which likely will mean more intensive work, but work which will improve student performance in the coming year. While the project itself is not student-driven, students have control in how they plan to complete the assignment. Teacher-designed summer projects mirror the students' future careers, in which the work is assigned but they have the independence to balance work with choice activities.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects provide students with the opportunity to use time over the summer to efficiently prepare for the course and develop skills regarding balance of work and play. Student-designed projects would not reflect the content of the course adequately, and a student-designed system does not prepare students for their lives after graduation, in which they will be expected to manage work given to them by authorities and balance their other activities. Teacher-designed summer projects have the major benefit of preparing students in both the short term and long term.",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, it's a good way to keep students prepared for the knowledge they will be learning in their new classes. Teachers setting up their projects for their students is a much more organized decision than rather having the students design it themselves.\n \n Me being a student I find it easier for my teacher to post the directions online, its faster and just incase I need help on the assignment, I can ask one of my classmates who have the class or are planning on taking the class for extra help if needed. Teacher-designed projects are also easier for the teacher to understand, for example, during the summer I had two summer projects and both of them were created by my teachers, once they were turned in by majority of the students, they were quickly graded and in the grade book. Having the directions already sorted out saves you a lot of time and saves you a major headache because you'll already have somewhat of an idea of what the professor expects from their students, as well as it's easier for them because they'll already have known everything thats supposed to be done and could help you understand if you didn't meet the requirements.\n \n From a teachers prospective, it might be easier for them to come up with an idea for a project because you don't really see a lot of student-designed projects, usually professors have detailed instructions on what, and how to do an assignment. Throughout my high schoolÂ career, the only project I've ever had to construct myself would be an essay in an English class, other than that I've never been faced with an assignment that wasn't created by the teacher. It's a teachers job to make assignments for their students, how is a student supposed to learn if there isn't a set of well-planned directions for an assignment taught by the teacher?\n \n In conclusion, I feel as though teacher-designed projects are cleaner and understandable for their students, it saves time for both parties, and it allows students to get a brief preparation as to what they will be learning in the nearby future.Â",

      "The summer months are a key time for both students and teachers to regroup from the school year that just occurred, andÂ to prepare for the school year that is to come at the end of their short break. This time is important to both groups because it is a more care free period where they are not under the constant pressure school brings. This time can be very beneficialÂ for everyone to prepare for the next school year. Studies have shown that students who do not continue to do educational work over the summer months fall behind and lose the information they gained during the prior school year. The most ideal project is teacher-designed because a student will most likely not plan an assignment that is actually helpful or one thatÂ prepares them for the upcoming year. A teacher will be able to design one that prepares the students well for the upcoming curriculumÂ and helps them manage their time well over the summer months. A summer assignment is one that will not be necessarily a very difficult one but it will require time management and if done well, can be very beneficial for the students.\n \n After the long school year the last thing a student wants to do is more work. If a student was to design their own project it probably would not be helpful. A teacher is able to access what is necessary to learn before the class starts and they will be able to create a project that is nothing but beneficial. In my own past experiences the summer projects have never been very difficult but they have required a small amount of my time and energy. When these projects were spread out I was able to complete them well and they helped me. I have never had a project assigned to me over the summer months that was necessarily difficult and I have never received a large amount of them at the same time. It is usually only required by a few core classes and it is not difficult to complete them. The only thing they really require is the time. They need to e done in a timely manor and done to the best ability to prepare for the next year.\n \n Managing time is one of the most important, yet difficult portion of a summer project but it is also something that is very difficult. Not only is it important for that summer project but those time management skills carry over into the coming school year. A project that is designed by a student may not properly prepare you for the rigor of the curriculum that is to come or the amount of time that is necessary for the class. A teacher creating a project will be able to demonstrate how much time the student will need to put in for their class in the upcoming year. If a student is able to manage their time well during the summer months when there is always something better to do then they will be able to manage all of their classes and those course loads better. They will have a better idea of what they need to do to succeed in the next school year.\n \n The classes over the years have only gotten more difficult in my personal experience and before y freshman year none of my teachers assigned any work for me to complete during the summer. I did not know anything about them on the first day or what the courses would be like. It was frightening and looking back I wish at least one of my teachers had assigned some form of work for me to do so that I had some idea ofÂ what I was getting into. It was sort of like being thrown into the deep end of a pool before ever learning how to swim. Keeping my head above water wasn't tasking but I was unable to swim to where I wanted. it took a little bit of time before I was actually comfortable in my classes and having some summer work would have made it much easier to transition into those classes.\n \n When I was younger the idea of summer was much different then it is today, just like the school years have changed. When I was younger my parents were involved in most aspects of my life and knew what summer work I had to do. I was taught that in order to succeed, I would have to do the work and do it well. I would never be able to reach my goals if I did not get the necessary things done on time and summer work was no different. Now I know that summer work is a large possibility for my breaks and f it is assigned it should be done. it is being assigned for a reason therefore I should complete it.\n \n Honestly I do not trust myself enough to create a well thought out project for myself without cutting myself some slack. I would much rather have a teacher give me the assignment and complete it to the best of my abilities.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that all the assignments that I am given during the summer months are well done and should be designed by the teachers instead of the students doing it for themselves. In the past the summer assignments that I have been given have not been too difficult and I never really minded doing them. The teacher is the one who teaches the class and if they expect us to have prior knowledge of the class then they should be the ones designing it. It is not going to be harmful and there is plenty of time over the summer for it to be completed so I do believe that a project designed by teacher over the summer is more beneficialÂ then one that would be designed by a student.Â",

      "Who knows more, the teacher or the student? That's right, most of the time teachers know more than students with the exception of a few prodigies. Teachers are individuals meant to help teach and prepare students for life. A teacher can also help get their students ready for their class by making a summer assignment. These assignments are intended to help students familiarize themselves with the upcoming course they are about to partake in and to keep their young minds active during the break. Teachers have many years of experience and they fully understand their course and its materials. Therefore, homework given to students in the summer are more beneficial if they are made by the educators because teachers will include all necessary material the student needs to help prepare them for class; teachers will design the review so that it can be used by all students; additionally, teachers can build up or revise theirÂ reviewÂ based on feedback of former students\n \n Projects given over the summer are usually big assignments that students dread, however, digesting the contents of project can immensely benefit students because it introduces students to the information they are going to learn over the next year. Teachers who make summer assignments include the information they think is crucial for students to know before they enter the class. An example is an AP World History teacher making students memorize the locations of countries all around the world as a part of their summer assignment. By knowing locations of different countries, students can recall the general area and apply the location to the lesson they are learning about, like the capital of Constantinople and what countries surround it. Teachers may also assign vocabulary words for students to learn. The words in summer assignments are usefulÂ because when the specific vocabulary word appears in class, students who did the summer assignment will know the definition and won't get stuck, unlike those who didn't complete the review. Similarly, teachers insist that students are familiar with basic math concepts and the properties of exponents and multiplication before entering algebra 2. By knowing the information teachers ask for, studentsÂ willÂ work faster without having to pause and ask questions in class.\n \n When teachers make the summer assignment, they create it so that all students can understand, review, and gain knowledge by finishing it. Teachers focus on all students and their way of learning during the process of developing the work; They don't focus on one specific student because that would be unfair to other students. Yes, teachers making customized review for a specific student would help the student tremendously, but that would not accommodate others because it is specific to the one student. A student-designed project would include only the information the former student remembers. Sometimes students don't remember certain crucial topics they learn in class. Establishing the fact students don't remember the whole course, they will leave the topics out of the review which in turn could affect and hurt future students. This could also mean students will create a review based on their style of learning whether it be more artistic or more reading based. Professors and teachers help their students because they have the obligation of educating, unlike students whose jobs are not to make sure other students understand the course material. In short terms, teachers focus on their students and their collective education while students focus on themselves and their individual education.\n \n Over the years of teaching, teachers will be able to receive feedback from former students and revise or build up their review. Summer projects can be designed to focus on the topics that are harder for students as a whole to understand. Through the input of students, teachers will be able to detect the harder subject and include practice for the difficult topic in the summer assignment. Students may also suggest ways to make the review more fun or resourceful. Teachers will sort through and determine which methods of review are most abundant when it comes to the material by considering the students' recommendations. Trial and error over time will help teachers create the most effective summer assignment for students and in turn help both parties.\n \n Summer assignments created and designed by teachers will help students and teachers themselves inÂ the upcoming semester through the knowledge they have of their students and their learning habits. Teachers are there to help all their students and part of the way they help students is through the preparation for their upcoming course and through the review of essential skills for class. By helping their students with review, they complete a portion of their goal to make students successful in school and in life.Â",

      "When I was in 9th and 10th grade, I had to do summer projects all the time. Even though I didn't want to do them, they helped me for the next year so my brain stayed fresh. However, doing it under the teachers rule felt like working in a factory, and it also felt like we weren't learning as much as we were just doing the project. I think that summer projects should be student designed because, it helps with the student's creativity level, puts less stress on the teachers, and allows the student to learn the best way possible.\n \n When you learn, it's best to learn in a way that is fun and enjoyable to do. Student designed summer projects would help the student's creativity level. My friend Generic_Name and I were able to design our own projects in middle school and got A's all the time, because we made our projects different each time we did them. Creativity level is also key when you have to do projects for work when you get older. If you want to stand out from all the other projects people are doing, the only to get creative with your product.\n \n Another reason students should design their own projects is because it could put less stress on the teachers who assigned it. With all the work the kids are doing, and since some teachers are putting in more time to grade and organize summer assignments, they'll be able to let the students work and all they ave to do is grade the work. I always talk to my teachers on a personal level, and a lot of them say that making/coming up with projects are one of the hardest things to do as a teacher when you have other things on your plate. So students making their own projects would help with that stress which means that they can put more time into grading your project precisely.\n \n Lastly, another way student designed projects are a better choice than teacher designed projects is because they allow the student to learn the best way possible. I always thought personalized learning was helpful. It let students be their own teacher and learn how to find information about a topic efficiently, and students learn better if they are forced to find the answer themselves. So if we make our own projects, we can choose how to learn the material in the best way, shape, or form.\n \n So summer projects should definitely be designed by students to expand their creativity, let teachers grade with time and no stress, and better their learning experience. Not only will students have a great grade on their summer project, but these skills that they are learning and using now will be very useful in college and in the work force when they're older.",

    Essay:
      "Projects play a huge role in the world that we live in today. A great amount of these amazing advancement in many fields have been made due to project work. When working on a project at school, many students can learn to form an amazing bond with one another and they can also learn from the experience. A multitude of students forget about school completely during summer break, so having them work on something can help them stay informed on a certain topic. These projects during summer break should be student-designed because it will show the students creativity, it will assure the completance of the assingment, and it will allow the teacher to see what the student's capabilities are.\n \n Showing creativity can be a very difficult thing for many students. It is equivalent to pulling someone out of their comfort zone. In the show Victorious, the theater teacher notices that his students face difficulty in expressing their creativity. Furthermore, he decides to let them create their own act to present to the class. By doing this he notices that his students are acting more free spirited and being more creative. When a teacher allows their students to create their own projects, they will notice a change in the students behavior. The amount of creativity will rise. The spark in the students eyes will show it all.\n \n Whenever a teacher says that there is going to be a big project coming up, you can always see the fear in many people's eyes because they think that they are going to end up procrastinating and not finish the project. Adding on, a teacher-designed project can make an individual feel caged in because there is only a minimum amount of ideas that they are allowed to use. Last year, my chemistry teacher made us create our own projects on an experiment we did during class. I did my project on chromotagraphy, and I was very delighted to work on it because the experiment really interests me. Adding on, I was very joyful to share my ideas with my collegues. During the project, my teacher saw the work effort that many students put in; she also realized that a lot more students had actually completed the assignment.\n \n During the summer many students have no motivation to complete any tasks, so if you tell a student to complete a certain project they will most likely end up procrastinating until a couple days before the due date. Furthermore, the teacher will probably end up getting a lousy piece of work that someone put up in approximately two days. This will never allow the teacher to see what the student is capable of doing. In The Office, a Netflix series, Michael asks his collegues to come up with a plan to save the workplace because they were going bankrupt. By doing this, he begins to realize that his employees have an immense amount of capabilities. He also begins to see all of their efforts and the amount of work that they could put in on a certain task, which had never happened before. I think we can relate this to a school environment because if a teacher tries to capture the student in a box, then the student will always think it is okay to stay in the box. Some people may believe that a teacher-designed project is the fairest way to assist an assignment. However, many teachers get extremely lousy grading the same thing over and over again. I have seen my teachers take a great amount of time to grade even the smallest assignments because they get tired of seeing a repitition of work. Adding on, if everyone were to do a project on the same idea there would be no variation.\n \n Placing the student in a box and not allowing them to express their creativity should not be how a task is graded. Students should not be kept to a certain amount of ideas; rather, they should be able to show what they are capable of doing. By allowing students to design their own projects during summer break, the students can show off their creativity, complete the assignment, and allow the teachers to see the students capabilities. It would also make the teacher's lives immensely easier because they do not have to create a summer assignment for the students to complete. This is preparing the students for their future becaue they are not always going to have assistance on particular things, so it is a good thing to teach them to be independent now.Â  Â Â Â",

    Essay:
      "The mentioning of school projects over the summer may cause a few children to complain, but some schools require students to complete them. There are many different types of assignments that can be given, the large decision of who determines the projects must be made first. Students and teachers may both be able to create a summer project, but teachers are the better option. Teachers should design summer projects because they can provide better content, grading is simpler, and they are more prepared to give such assignments.\n \n Summer projects designed by teachers would be better for learning specific school-related content. Teachers who know the curriculum for their class can give projects over the summer that prepare students for the following school year.Â Student-designed projects would be less representative of actual class material and therefore be less beneficial for learning. For example, students will have a much harder time planning a trigonometry project over the summer than their future teacher for the class would, because they are not yet familiar with the subject; instead, the trigonometry teacher can provide one using their knowledge. Although new teachers may not be strong in the subject they plan to teach, projects could be created jointly among teachers in the same field. An assignment could even take advantage of collaboration among many teachers to create an assignment that reflects multiple subjects.\n \n Teachers should create summer projects because it would be simpler for grading purposes. It will be easier for teachers to grade projects they assign, because they created the content and know what to expect. Likewise, if students were to create their own projects over the summer, teachers may not be fully prepared to score what they are given. Children will likely find more problems with the grade they receive if they are given the freedom to design their own projects, because the requirements of the project could be debated. It is redundant for teachers to ask their students what they plan to complete over the summer and deal with all of them. If teachers were to create the project, there will be less confusion and the children can instead question the teachers to clarify concerns. Even if there is a rubric all students must follow for the assignment they create, it would be simpler for the teachers to design the whole project themselves.\n \n Teachers are better prepared to create a project over the summer when compared to students. A summer assignment will most likely be large and have many requirements. Teachers are tasked with assigning multiple projects every school year, so they are more able to make a better project. One of the desires of having a student-designed project may be to give students the possibility to use their own interests. However, not all students have the necessary skills to create their own project that also fulfills school requirements, and so this could just cause unneeded stress for some children. The school year itself will almost always consist of teachers giving an assignment, and students completing them. A teacher-designed project given over the summer will be better for everyone involved because of this.\n \n There are pros and cons to teachers determining the makeup of summer projects, but the positives greatly outnumber the negatives. The job requirement of a teacher is to provide students with the ability to learn, and to create a summer project themselves helps achieve that. All students do not possess the skills teachers have to give relevant content for a certain class or subject. The task of giving a summer project for students to complete should be given to teachers.",

      "Some schools require student to complete a project over their summer break to make sure they keep on learning. Should the projects be designed by the teacher or the students?. They should be teacher designed, It would make it more of a challenge to the students. Teachers just make things a little more challenging.\n \n It would be more of a challenge is first reason. If teachers decides on what a student has on he's or her project,it's most likely that it will be more of a challenge. Teachers can choose a subject the students know nothing about. That opens the students mind to learning something new. They will work harder, put more mind into it, and most importantly they are learning.\n \n If the students designed the project it would be too easy. Clearly students enjoy the breaks because they are out of school and hoping for no work. That's coming from a student like myself. If a student decided what he's or her project on it would be on a easy subject. Not only because we wanna have it easy, but also because we wanna rush it. Students wouldn't really learn anything if the project is on something they already know about. Also wouldn't be recieving very little to no new information, so are they really learning that way.\n \n Although other people may disagree, they can say it takes away from students creativity on the project. Students that have their project picked by the teacher may also have a possibilty of not doing it. They may not like the topic so they decide to go with their break and forget about the project. It's also a break for a reason they want time of from school; finally not in class learning. Students may also have their own intrest that may make him work really hard on a project.\n \n But in conclusion should the project be teacher or student designed?. It should be teacher designed, students just benefit more off it. They get their work done then they can decicide what to do with the rest of their summer. They will have the proper break that they been waiting for. But in conclusion there just more benefits in teacher-designed projects.",

      "Do you remember your last summer project? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric.\n \n Student designed projects could be great since they can make how difficult it is for them, but this is not a good idea. A teacher designed summer project is the way to go because the teachers can choose how challenging the projects are for their students. For example, students would try to make their projects very easy for them to complete so that they could do less work, but this would not allow them to learn very much. Teachers would make sure that the topic encourages the student to push themselves and use what they have learned throughÂ outÂ the school year to complete it. This way the students would not forget the material they have learned the past year and go into the next school year fresh and ready to go.\n \n Secondly, Teacher designed summer projects would be better because they can make the project teach new material. For instance, a math project could show the students how to use a new formula that will be needed for their next grade. In addition to using topics that they already know so that they won't be forgotten, the project could incorporate a new concept. In doing so, students could learn and use these new topics to help them smoothly transition into the new year.\n \n Finally, the last reason why summer projects should be teacher designed is because they can grade them on their own rubric. For example, if students create their own summer projects then it would be a bit more complicated to grade their projects. if the teacher creates the project, then they can make sure that it meets certain criteria that would be needed.\n \n In conlusion, Teacher designed summer projects would be far better than student designed summer projects because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric. To whom it may concern, I strongly suggest that summer projects be, and stay, teacher designed.Â",

    Essay:
      "It should come as no surprise that the secret to scholarly success is to stay one step ahead of the competition. Recognizing this, many schools have opted to assign summer course work to ensure their students start the next year strong. However, they often face the dilemma over whether these assignments should be designed by teachers or by the students themselves. Despite the possibility of kids slacking off, student-driven summer work will prepare students for a future in their chosen field and ease the stressful workloads of both teachers and students alike.\n \n The stress of a high school environment is all but increasing, and has been for decades. This trend has been documented extensively over the years, and all these studies sum up to high-schoolers, on average, being exhausted, overworked and overall unhappy on a daily basis. Teachers are not spared either, as they face the same struggles their students deal with day in and day out, often for no more than a substandard salary to say the least. Therefore, it makes sense for schools to do anything in their means to ease the burdens of a rigorous academic climate. One of the best ways to go about this would be to allot responsibilities of designing summer work from teachers to their students.\n \n Another advantage of this proposition is that students will be able to take control of their own educational futures. The thought and effort they put into their summer work will directly manifest itself in their scores. Those who perform poorly will score poorly, whereas those who take it seriously will reap the rewards. This is the best way for teachers to measure the academic integrity of a class, allowing them to hone in on students who need assistance the most over the coming school year. As an added benefit, students will be pushed to learn other essential skills such as time management and independence which will certainly come into play later on in their lives.\n \n Perhaps most important of all, students will have the opportunity to pursue an area of study of their choice. An individualized approach tailored for and by each student on their own is sure to make learning a more enjoyable and productive experience. In contrast, a standardized assignment designed to fulfill the needs and wants of each unique individual in a class at once amounts to nothing but stress, frustration and apathy towards what could have been an indispensable tool for students' future careers.\n \n The advantages of a student-driven summer project far outweigh the potential pitfalls of such a program.\n \n Those who would be inclined to laze their way out of assignments will find ways to avoid doing work no matter what, so why impede the success of the majority due to the inevitable actions of the few? Hopefully soon enough academic institutions will come to their senses and adopt such policies which provide unlimited benefit to all involved.",

The more students what to do the project the mare effort or thought will be put in to it. who better to make a project to keep students attention the the students themselves. Because while students are on break many do not have people to push them and make sure they are doing their work so it has to be a project that they would want to do on their own. and if a blunder is made the student can't say they didn't understand because the students designed the projects.

      "Teacher-designed or Student-designed Summer Assignments?\n \n Summer assignments are imperative for keeping students learning over their break, as well as keeping them active in their creativity. All classes should have some form of summer assignment. With that being said, some people may prefer to be given specific guidelines to follow, others may prefer to take matters into their own hands. Everyone has different learning habits and some are better than others. These assignments should be student- designed because you are more motivated and perform better when given space for creativity, there will be less procrastination, and theres more room for retaining information.\n \n Motivation can take a student a long way. Doing well on summer assignments is important so, it's also important to give students opportunities to be creative in their own way.\n \n Designing the project themselves gives them that drive to make a good project and present it to their teach with pride. Nothing is better than being inspired and excited to show your teacher what you've been working so hard on over the summer when school starts again in the fall. Students know whats best for them and will have a better project thats more personalized and expresses their thought process of said topic if they design their project. Teachers oftentimes struggle coming up with interactive projects that will get their students thinking. Giving them the freedom to create their own type of project is better than having students struggle to come up with ideas.\n \n Summer time is about having fun, but also preparing for the next school year and thats why we have summer projects. Many students dread summer assignments but they shouldn't have to. School assignments shouldn't be stressful, but many of them are. This is why many students procrastinate with their summer assignments because they have no interest in the work. Students tend to procrastinate for long periods of time, until the last few weeks of summer, or even the last few days before returning to school in the fall. From one perspective, if a student can do the project the way they prefer, they are likely not to put the project to the side. Giving students all the tools they need not to procrastinate is key to a well designed, well thought out project.\n \n Most students are just looking to get a passing grade for the work they did in the summer, however, actually learning from the project is important too. Designing their own project ensures they will learn a couple of things in the process. In my experience, I am more likely to learn something new and connect it to other things if I have a hand in the process of making it. This makes it more interesting for me and, in result, I get excited to learn new things. When teachers design assignments in general it may feel a little forced upon students and they simply won't learn as much in comparison to if they were to be apart of the creative process. The whole point of these projects is for students to learn something new or review something they learned the past school year so it's important these projects are designed in the students favor.\n \n Some may argue that teachers can design a better assignment than students because they know whats best; However, students are more motivated when given the space to be creative, being passionate from that motivation will decrease procrastination, and students will actually learn something if they design projects the way they like. Students are the future of the world and deserve the right education tools to succeed. All in all, students should have more say now a days in their assignments and more teachers should promote creative freedom in their classrooms to further motivate students.",

      "Little Generic_Name was assigned a summer project, he had to: attend a club over the summer, take pictures with the kids there, then write about what he liked the most about it. The project was teacher-designed and was due the first day of school. A few months went by and school was the very next day, little Generic_Name forgot all about the project and didn't do his assigned work so, he failed the project. Some people think summer work should be teacher-designed. I think summer work should be student-designed because, It's on your time, you can write about what you want, and you'll still have time to have fun during the summer.\n \n First of all, having a student-designed project is better because it's on your time you don't have to worry about not knowing if the project makes sense or even worry that you don't finish on time because your to busy at home. For example, Generic_Name was assigned summer work but always seemed to be busy doing chores and helping his mom around the house. Everytime Generic_Name went to do his work, his mom would call him to do his chores or help with his brother, he felt he was never going to get his work done. Having a student-designed project can prevent you from forgetting about the assigned work from your teacher because some teachers want you to actually go out your way and expect it to be typed up, emailed, and done in mid summer. When you can just write about something you once expierenced before and be done with it on your time.\n \n Secondly, having a student-designed project you can write about anything you want, anything you expierenced or ever done. You can take your time on it and not feel rushed by anyone. It's better having a sudent-designed project because if it was towards the end of summer you can make up something or think of a memory that happened during mid summer or towards the begining of summer. For example, Generic_Name didn't start her summer project that was due when she came back to school, she had a few days before school started. She rememered taking pictures on a special night with her friends and family while sitting at a bonfire and decided to write about that, her pictures were already ready. She realized it was easier having work assigned for herself and not from a teacher or assistant.\n \n Last, while having student-designed work you can do your project and still have fun during the summer. You can do it right when you get home from the last day of school and have the full summer ahead of you or even wait right before school starts and do your project. Having summer work that was assigned from your teacher can be hard because they want you to do certain stuff like: visit the museum and write about it, go to the beach and collect seashells, or even go camping and take pictures of the wild. When you can just write about a special event that happend or even just write about what happend during your day at home or at the pool.\n \n Some people think having teacher-designed work is much easier than having student-designed work. I think having student-designed work is easier and quicker than having to write out something you don't know to much about or doing work that doesn't interest you. Teachers assign work that they want you to do, summer is about fun and it should be up to the student wether what he/she want to write about. That's why I think student-designed work is better than teacher-designed work.\n \n Having student-designed can later affect those in the future because the same thing we do may happen to them later on in life. Some people think teacher-designed work is easier however, they're wrong because teachers or assistants expect you to go out your way to write about something. Some kids dont go outside or some can be allergic to the pollen during the summer and decideds to stay inside. While having student assigned work you can talk about something you've done last summer or somthing that happend during the spring and write about it. You can write about anything that happened to you, you can do it on your own time and still have fun during the summer. Having student-designed work is much more easier than having teacher-designed work. Â Â Â",

When students are presented with a project that allows them to be creative they are then truly enabled to produce great work.

Summer is not a time students want to be engulfed by yet another project given by their teacher, but having a productive outlet for students to be creative will bring about great results.\n \n Being assigned a topic you are not interested in brings about dread, a sense of wasted time, and many other negative emotions; which will likely only produce work lacking its full potential. When a student is given the choice to produce work that interest them the students true potential is often seen. Choosing a topic independently makes your work more interesting, knowing you are the only person working on it. Having a teacher assign you a project feels more like just another paper to you and the teacher than your work does knowing you are producing creative, meaningful, and worth-while work. Feeling that reassurance that you are creating unique work makes a project feel more like an enrichment to your education rather than just another dreadful assignment.\n \n Many people are held back from expressing their full creativity because they simply are not interested in the project they are given in such a way for it to resonate with them on a creative level. However, having students select their own project eliminates that problem. Working on something that you have no interest in verses something that you want to put your effort and time into creates two completely different results. Spending your energy on something you actually want to work on is bound to have much more pleasing results than something you are not very interested in. Having this option also gets rid of any doubt you are potential doing your assignment incorrectly.\n \n The point of a summer project is to keep your mind engaged while you are out of the classroom setting. However, you may still need help and have questions about your assignment in summer where you do not have readily access to someone who can answer your questions. Being assigned a specific project is bound to bring about stress on whether or not you are doing it correctly. With a project that allows you to choose and be more creative with your assignment you have the ability to shape your ideas around how you think they should be done and not have the stress of a projects guidelines and curriculum.\n \n Some may say students are bound to select a topic that they can easily brush off without much thought but, many students seek for somewhere to unleash their creativity and have it seen in a positive productive way. Having a student-designed project is a great opportunity for many learners and educators to bring their own lives and preferences into learning. Projects should be based more upon personal learning and preference rather than curriculum and rubrics.Â",

      "Summer projects are not as fun as they sound, Although, being able to design your own sounds interesting. As the school year ends, students expect an endless summer with adventures and tons of trips, however, a project must be due in the beginning of the next school year. Teachers begin to brainstorm ideas and assignments for the next school year as well. Allowing the students to design their own projects would make their summer a lot more interesting than it sounds. If the students designed their own summer projects it would make the students' summer more about creativity, it would allow the teacher to observe the students' mindset, and benefit the teacher to create a lesson comparing different perspectives.\n \n The one thing every student has in common is the enjoyment of summer break. A one-to-two month period of no school, heavy sunshine, fun trips, long vacations, and valuable memories. Students expect to have fun and enjoy their summer break away from school. Allowing the students to design their projects would let the student now be more creative and will allow their brain to think more in depth about the project than when a teacher designs it. Their summer will be educational and entertaining.\n \n In the first few weeks of school, teachers tend to struggle to get to know their students. If the student designed their projects, it will benefit them because they will be able to observe how their student thinks in different scenarios. They will save more time not only getting to know the student but grading as well, instead ofÂ multipleÂ \"get to know you\" packets that they create every year. It will decrease the stress of getting to know the students they have that year.\n \n When the new school year approaches, students expect to write about themselves and hear about the class criteria and behaviors. A quick lesson can be taught based on the projects the students designed. It would behoove the teacher to do a quick lecture about the assignment and why it was given. It becomes a great team building exercise as well by comparing the projects and explaining the goal of the assignment.\n \n Overall, students designing their projects would not only benefit themselves but the teachers as well to learn about each other and the subject. Designing a project is not easy, having summer experiences can help with that. It would allow the student to embrace their creativity and think outside the box. It would also be helpful for the teachers to observe more on their students' mindset. Lastly, it would help the students and teachers' communication in education based on their overall observation.",

      "In America, the summer break is the longest break students will have. It is usually three months, June, July, and August. In this time frame, most students do not keep with with outside, extracurricular class so, it is a period of no learning. As a result, students forget most of what they have learned in the previous years. A direct effect is some schools requiring students to complete summer projects. A question arises if these summer projects should be either teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, it allows for freedom, allows for creativity, and the student is more likely to place more effort.\n \n Summer projects should be student based because it allows for more freedom. When a project is assigned by a teacher, a student may not put the effort they are capable of because the project bores the student. To solve this, the projects should be determined by the student. This allows for more freedom to choose and the student has an urge to complete because they had chose it. This may also take off a burden for the teacher, who has to develop a project for the class. If a students has the freedom to chose their project, they will be more likely to complete it.\n \n Student-designed summer projects allows for creativity. Students are allowed to chose their projects on whatever they like. Whether it be math, science, english, history, or any other subject the student is interested in. As a result of this, the students are allowed to direct the project in whichever way they wish. This direction will make the student more interested in their project, as it is one of their interests. When students are interested in a certain topic, they will be more likely to complete it faster and put more effort into it. Student-designed projects will have more effort placed into it.\n \n Lastly, if summer projects are student-designed, the student will be more likely to place more effort. Alongside grades, this gives the student an added incentive. If students design their own project, since it will be their interest, they will be more likely to complete. There are several students who place minimal effort, or no effort at all in projects, especially if the topic does not interest them. This can be solved if the project were student-designed. Summer projects, in which were designed by the students, will have a higher chance of being completed and having more effort placed into them.\n \n Critics may argue, saying students will abuse this and make the project as simple as possible. Although this may happen, it is the teacher's job to provide guidelines on the project. Such as how many slides, if it is a presentation, or words, if it is an essay, or minutes, if it is a speech. The teachers will be in control of the format of the project. This disallows the student to simplify the project.\n \n To conclude, schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed, because it allows for freedom, allows for creativity, and there is more effort in the project.Â",

      "Summer break is a time for everyone to decompress and relax after a long school year. Projects over break are stressful, especially teacher-designed ones. Breaks should be spent having fun and spending time with family/friends. Students work their butts of enough during the year and shouldnt have to do that over summer. Summer projects should be student-designed because it'llÂ give students a chance to make the project chill, it will allow more independence for the students, and it will have a better chance of making the students summer adventurous.\n \n The one thing students ask of the most would be a laid back summer. Because of all the stress they endure during the year, students want a bit of time to reflect and relax. If students make their own projects they could make it very simple. Most may think of that as taking a shortcut through life, but in reality they do enough work as it is in school. If teachers made the projects, chances are they'd want to challenge the students a lot. When projects are teacher-designed students are less likely to complete it. To add on students wouldn't want to ruin their schedule with a boring project that their teacher designed; they'd want their project to be less time consuming during break.\n \n One key factor for students is a sense of independence. Students are growing older and majority of them want to do tasks on their own. Doing their own projects would give them that freedom. The project could also be a way for them to boost their confidence in what they are capable of doing. It would be a great way for them to see how being independent with certain things is like. Student-designed projects may be a way for students to teach themselves responsibility. It would give them a greater aspect of being able to deal with time management skills. Furthermore they wouldn't be relying on their teachers for specific things such as: making a due date, setting up the project, making specific directions, etc.\n \n Most students enjoy exploring over summer; and what better way to do it than through a project. Student-designed projects would allow students to create it however they want. Even if it's a group project or even one where they'd need to actually go somewhere. Teachers wouldn't make it all that interesting, they'd just add a few things to make it \"fun\" but not to where a student would get excited. If students want more time with friends and family, they could add things into the project to make that happen. Teachers are known as the \"fun killers\", so students would get the chance to take matters into their own hands and fix that.\n \n Overall people may think teacher-designed projects are better because of teachers \"knowing what they are doing\", but that is not always true. It is good to let students take over sometimes. It is also a great way for teachers to see the potential for their students. Student- designed projects can show one's creativity and imagination. Teachers don't always get to see that side of students during the year. To conclude it all students should be able to design their own projects to attain their independence, add some adventure to their break, and gain a relaxing summer break.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "In order to keep students minds refreshed and thinking, it is crucial for them to learn even when away from school. During summer many students forget about their studies which is why some schools require summer projects. These projects ensure that the students are learning new material over break. In order to make the kids more interested, these projects should be student-designed. If these projects were student-designed they wouldÂ help students develop new skills, learn topics their interested in, and make students more motivated to learn.\n \n Students would develop many new skills if their summer projects were designed by them. The students would develop responsibility in the sense that they have to hold themselves accountable and actually do their job of creating the project. Most students are used to their teachers assigning them projects so this would also force them to get out of their comfort zone and do something their not used to. If the projects were student-designed it would also teach the students time management skills since they would have to create and complete their own project by the end of the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects also let students research topics that they are interested in. When teachers assign projects the students are forced to learn certain material but letting them design their own project gives them the freedom to learn about different topics. Even though the students are learning about the topics they have chosen, they are still learning new information and keeping their brain working. The students may even do more leaning than if a teacher had assigned the project because they are actually interested and wanting to learn.\n \n Having summer projects be student-designed would also make the kids more motivated to learn. If the students are able to pick their own topic and control what they are learning about they will be more motivated to complete the project. Letting the students have choices on their project makes it a lotÂ easier and interesting for them resulting in them being motivated to finish it.\n \n Student-designed projects would assure the students continue learning on their break. It would teach them many useful skills and prepare them for doing large tasks on their own. Some may argue student-designed projects give kids too much freedom but student-designed projects allows the students to enjoy their summer while also learning new information. The project keeps the student thinking and using his/her knowledge which should be all that matters. Student-designed projects keeps students motivated and interested in learning.",

    Essay:
      "Teachers work much harder than students do. They make lesson plans, attend countless meetings, and grade their student's assignments. Why would they want to work harder than already do? Summer assignments are not meant to be gruelingÂ tasks for the student or the teacher; simply, they overview materials pertinent to the class so that during the school year, teachers won't have to spend time going over fundamental concepts and students won't have to spend time relearning old topics. If teachers were to assign summer projects, they would give a solid foundation for the curriculum of the class, teachers could be of help to students who don't understand, and it would make both the student and the teacher's school year easier.\n \n Knowing and teaching a curriculum to a class is the basis of a teacher's job. Because of their experience with students and knowledge of the school system, a good teacher is in the best position to divvy summer assignments to an upcoming class. For example, accelerated math classes require a strong grasp of basic concepts. Going into calculus, being proficient in algebra, trig identities, properties of logarithms, and knowing graphs are a few of the many fundamental concepts that are frequently applied before doing any actual calculus. The average student would not go out of their way remember what they learned so many years ago. If a teacher is trying to teach their students new mathematical concepts and they don't have these basics, then the students will fail to understand. Because a teacher would have access to the proper prerequisites, a teacher-designed summer assignment would include the most integral topics required to be successful in their course.\n \n Even with Google and countless online videos and articles, the most efficient way to learn would be one on one with a professional. A virtual lesson cannot give a student the same feedback that a teacher can. For example, in Latin classes, noun and verb endings can be memorized as easily as the alphabet. However, identifying how those endings relate to all the different grammatical constructions can be difficult. Google Translate cannot explain why certain endings change the meaning of a verb or a noun, its algorithm only spits out an inaccurate and basic translation with no regard to context. A readily available teacher could review the whole translation in context, go over any confusion of grammatical concepts, then supplement their explanation with some credible resources for the student to use. Unlike school, the teacher will not always be there to help, but they wouldn't set their students up for failure either. With enough guidance, students can learn on their own and teachers will consequently recognize how their different students will learn best during the school year.\n \n Being a teacher requires so much patience towards their students, co-workers, and higher ups. They can really only attempt to control the student aspect. Dealing with student and parent complaints would be so detrimental to a teacher's morale, so why would they make assignments that their students mostly dislike? Not only that, but grading challenging and dynamic assignments would be so tiring and time consuming. After break, that simple summer assignment puts a letter in the grade bookÂ and, if done correctly, makes the students feel accomplished and primed for learning. Now that the students are equipped with a basic understanding of the class and the teacher has begun to understand the learning patterns of their students, the school year is set up to be smooth and successful.\n \n Even though students might complain or question at their teacher's methods towards learning, they are professionals and know what they are doing. A teacher should want their students to be as successful as their potential allows, so the teacher-designed summer assignments would be reasonably challenging and include the most important topics with regards to the subject. If properly executed, teacher-designed summer assignments are best suited to set up an easy and enjoyable school year.Â",

      "Some teachers always told me \" you can never stop learning\".\n \n You can really never stop learning, and teachers know that. Thats why teachers should design summer projects, to help a student be above what they were the following year,and help them have a jump start when they go into the next year by helping them retain information and having them explore into the subject they are going to learn the next year. Its good to remember that the key to learning is to never stop learning, and teacher know that the best.\n \n Some teachers like to give assignments to students over the summer to help them retain any information that can help them in their next year if school. English teacher usually let students pick a book and they have to write a essay or give a presentation about the book. Other teachers might have you explore what you are going to learn next year and make you do a project on the subject you are going into next year to see if it can give you a jump start in your subject. With this jump start you will be above other students who were not given a summer project by their teacher, assuring that you will succeed in your subject.\n \n Teachers will normally give the student all summer to finish their project. This is more than enough time to do a project especially during summer break because you have more time during the day. During the school year teachers give a time period to finish a project and it is usually a lotÂ shorter than 2 months. Students should have no excuse to not be able to finish a summer project assigned by their teacher. With having 2 months to do an assignment you can break it up in parts and do it throughout the whole break to help you even more o retain information.\n \n Coming back to school with a fresh memory is the key to succeed. It will help you go back to school already feeling refreshed with everything you need to know. If a student were to design a project to do over the summer they would make it about stuff they are already good at or mastered, When a teacher designs it, it's to help you learn something you will need for the next year. When teachers design these projects its to help students and some students don't really understand. They think it's just a teacher giving them work to do over the break they are not supposed to have work during, but its designed to help them learn.\n \n Giving a summer assignment is a way to never stop learning. I believe teachers should design the projects students do because they usually know what students need to know for the up-coming year. Teacher like to assign summer projects so students can continue learning even after their long summer break. This isn't a bad idea, after all, they give the students around 2 months to finish the project depending on how long their break is. This will help students retain some information that can help them in their up-coming school year so they can have a fresh memory coming back. If students were to design a school project they would usually take advantage and not give themselves a good enough project to help them retain information.",

    Essay:
      "School projects offer students with the chance to a more engaging and creative way of learning through their own forms of research, application, and presentation of what they are learning about in school. During school, projects are often based off of particular subjects of study in different classes, such as making shapes with parabola equation graphs in Algebra II or a poster of the effects of the Battle of Generic_City in WWII in AP World History. Although projects during the school year offer a new path of more in depth learning for many students, summer projects outside of school can offer new skills, learning, and engagement beyond the classroom and can sharpen students' minds for the next school year ahead of them. Summer projects should not only act as a new form of learning, but should also act as a freeway for students' creativity, passions, and interests to travel through their work. Summer projects should be student-driven and designed in order to keep the student engaged and interested in what they are doing, to allow them the freedom of summer vacation, and to increase the value of what they learned to them and their intellectual development.\n \n During the summer, students have more time to focus on what they enjoy and are engaged in. From traveling to sports, students have way more interest in things they enjoy doing in the summer rather than teacher-designed school activities and projects, things that they have experienced throughout the whole school year prior. Students should have the opportunity to learn about something that they are interested in in order to keep them engaged and do their best work on the summer project. Although basic guidelines should be given by teachers of broad knowledge of instructions to give the student a framework, students should be able to pick a topic and media that will keep them motivated to complete the project to the best of their ability. For example, if a student is interested in the environmental issues facing the Amazon Rainforest, the summer should be an opportunity for them to show their interest in that particular subject while also learning valuable lessons of accountability and new learning for a school grade.\n \n Summer is also a time for students to have freedom from the walls of their school building and to experience new and exciting things. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed: students should have the opportunity to learn through ways that they love and are engaged in, allowing them freedom to grow and learn through their own motivations. If summer projects for students were teacher-designed, already handing students a topic, media, and specific guidelines, a student would loose the value of summer freedom and the break from school-designed activities and projects. This could lead the student to become less engaged, less responsible, and less-likely to do their best work, due to being confined by teacher-given provisions. Students already experience this throughout an entire school year and should be able to have freedom in what they focus their summer work on. This will not only enable them to be interested and passionate about what they are doing, but also will allow them to have the freedom that they have all been craving throughout the school during the summer months of vacation.\n \n Finally, students should be able to choose their summer project in order to increase the value of what they learned to themselves and their intellectual development. Often when a student is given a project or activity by a teacher of something that they are not as interested in, students become less likely to actually retain what they are learning and are not able to grow as freely or nearly as much. In comparison, when students are given the opportunityÂ to pick their topic of study and focus along with how they are going to complete the project, students will be able to value what they are learning so much more because of their passion and interest in the subject. This allows for students to grow intellectually during the months away from school while also letting them focus on a topic or media that they love.\n \n Summer projects can be extremely beneficial to students and their learning outside of the classroom while also giving the student a way to express their passions and interests. This is necessary for a student to stay engaged, learn with value, and to do their work to the best of their ability. This not only allows a student to continue to learn during the summer months, but also gives a student the freedom to learn new knowledge of topics that they are interested in and enjoy. Â Â Â  Â",

      "Imagine, your school requiring you to do teacher designed projects while your on summer break. School's want to make sure their students are still learning during their time off, but is this the right way to do it? I think the students should be able to pick what type of project they want to do because, it will be something they are interested about.\n \n If students are told to do a project about something they have no interest in, they either wont complete it, or will do a bad job on it. EspeciallyÂ without the teacher being right there to answer any questions they might have about the assignment. Students that get to choose their project will have more drive to want to do it, because its something they are interested in. They won't look at it as an assignment but as a learning experience for them to learn more about what they already enjoy.\n \n It also gives students the ability to imagine and be creative when it comes to making the project for their self. Students will be more hands on and exited to do something that they get to pick oppose to a teacher rubric they would have to follow to complete the assignment. Also they might get bored and loose motivation throughout the teacher designed project. If students design their own projects it makes them put more thought behind it and use more creativity.\n \n Students may not like the idea of doing schoolwork over their break, but if they get to choose what they do they might be more intrigued by the assignment. Although it might be harder for some students to come up with their own ideas, in the long run it will be more fun for them. Learning about something you are interested in, is a lot easier oppose to learning about something you dont care about. Getting students engaged in the assignment is the main point of making them complete one.\n \n If students are engaged in learning more about something they enjoy, the knowledge about the topic will most likely stay in their mind better than something they either dont want to write about or dont know anything about. Furthermore if a student has a question on the assignment or doesnt know how to do something who are they supposed to ask when its summer and they are at home? Another reason why students should be able to pick their project is because, if its something they arent interested in they arent going to want to spend their time off doing it. Teacher designed projects are never going to get done over summer break, but let the student pick the project and you have a better chance to see a completed project.\n \n I feel like students should definitelyÂ be able to pick their project based on how students are with assigned work they dont want to do. It gives a great learning experience and teaches independence for students who might need other life skills before they graduate high school. It not only teaches the studentsÂ responsibilityÂ to have the project done but it teaches a lot more because they have to start from scratch and use their own ideas. Its a part of maturity to understand tasks and jobs that have to be complete. Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Do you want to make teaching fun, let your students decide their own summer projects!\n \n As schools want their students to continue learning during their break, its important that students have a interest on their education so, that they will be able to succeed in their desired careers. Studies show that students are more able to focus in their school work,when their involved and participating. The student's break is their time to relax, recharge and rejuvenate for the upcoming school year, which should allow them to have a say in their summer projects. The summer projects, schools require students to complete should be student-designed because, it allows them to be creative, open-minded, responsible and to have the ability to retain information easier.\n \n Having student-designed projects will allow students to feel more independent and create relationships with others by letting themselvesÂ be put in charge. As a student, I feel more encouraged to put effort in school assignments by working with other students and getting use to leadership skills as what we need in the future to succeed. Student-designed projects will solely be up to students who get to choose interesting project ideas which will be fun to think of creative ways to display our ideas. As we demonstrate open-mindness through the projects, students would feel more comfortable in their topic they maybe struggling in. For example, If a student was lacking outdoor skills they could start gardening, little by little each week to start feeling more comfortable and benefiting the community while they do so. Students may have the most interesting project ideas which make the teaching process easier.\n \n In my experience of being a student, I've noticed that when students are in charge of summer projects, it tends to raise participation in class and help retain information easier. Class clowns become more interested and encouraged in learning new topics. Students that tend to take school more seriously strengthens their passion on their goal. Students will be more engaged in their upcoming classes, as they already built that skill through their summer projects. When I was in middle school, we had to complete a summer project that ensured that we were benefiting the community, most students decided to go to a food bank, go to homeless shelters, volunteer at hospitals, supplying stray dogs and many more. I chose to construct a food drive and give out food donations to the homeless people and stray animals in my neighborhood ; many people in my neighborhood found my idea to be helpful. My neighbors and family friends decided to join me which became a success, we raised over $3,000 in food products which were animal-friendly and safe for the homeless people and animals.\n \n Although, others may argue that having teacher-designed projects will reduce cheating in classes and give students a preview of what to expect from the class when students are enrolled in the fall. Teachers can get ahead start to see who's struggling, can assist them throughout the year and plan accordingly. Teacher-designed projects could help the class become ahead in their lessons in the fall. Depending on your teacher, you may be subjected to bias positions and issues for your projects. For example, my freshman year we were assigned a summer project which was a biased, teacher-designed and the teacher assigned us a position on the issue and had to come up ways to support our argument. Personally, I didn't agree with the position I got but, had to improvise and it made me feel like my opinion didn't matter; I was hiding behind this position my teacher gave me; especially since the issue was about my identity and how my ancestors were treated in the past. I didn't want to support the pros on slavery because, it was degrading to me and most students felt that way. Allowing teacher-designed projects doesn't establish a trusting relationship, making most students feel excluded.\n \n The summer projects, schools require students to complete should be student-designed because, it allows them to be creative, open-minded, responsible and to have the ability to retain information easier. Teachers can get to know students and learn their interests and goals. It should be the teacher's priority to maintain a good relationship with students and to help them reach their goals. Students can learn more about themselves during the process and discover new passions. Giving students the opportunity to design their own project ensures that they are learning over their break, but in a more effective and fun way. Students will be able to remember topics they've learned with their projects because of all the fun they had to construct it. Having a student perspective on a project is beneficial to teachers because student-designed projects may help the teacher learn as well.",

      "Many students are assigned projects over the summer that are to be given to the teacher upon return to school. There is an ongoing debate over students summer projects being student-designed. Those who disagree state that students will be set up for failure and that they will not have enough work on their project, but this is not true. Although some may disagree student-designed summer projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed summer projects.\n \n There are many reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. When doing a school project you normally have guidelines, but if students design it themselves they will not have guidelines. The only thing about not having guidelines is that it must be appropriate for school. When teachers assign summer projects your stuck inside a box, but when you create your own project you can be more creative and think outside the box. The more creative you are the better chance you have of passing. Many teachers assign boring projects like reading a book and writing an essay, but if a student designs it you will have better topic choices, you can do it according to your knowledge.\n \n There are further reasons why summer projects should not be teacher-designed. Students can come up with many ideas; what you got out of the school year, your school environment, and what you learned that school year. Many students like to be able to get their point across or express how they feel. Freedom of expression is very important and very beneficial when students come up with their own project. Even though summer projects are tiring it gives you a chance to be different. Being different play a big role going through school. You can show how different you are through a simple summer project.\n \n Although some may disagree, student-designed summer projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed summer projects.

Those who disagree with summer projects being student-designed state that, students will be set up for failure, and that they will not have enough work on their project but this is not true. This topic is important because some of the students are stuck to doing one thing how the teacher wants them to do it. Many students want to be able to express themselves and come up with their own ideas. Having students do a project that they designed will be much more entertaining and will give them a chance to step outside the box and be different.Â",

      "Teachers usually believe they know whats best for their students, since from a time long past they were students too, but that is not necessarily true. Its been a long time since teachers roamed the halls of high schoolÂ or middle school, and things have changed. This is why students need to be the ones designing summer projects since students are the ones doing them, the stress of students and the balance between work and fun.\n \n This next bit is simple, since students are the ones doing the projects they should be the ones to design it. Although during the school year teachers design most if not all homework that comes the students way, that homework is not on the same scale as a summer project. With a summer project you are givenÂ the whole summer to finish the project and since it is on such a large scale and affecting so much time, students should be the ones designing the projects. Students being the ones to complete the projects is not the only reason.\n \n Stress is a fickle thing; not enough of it and nothing will get done, but if theres to much your whole life can fall apart. Students and teachers experience different kinds of stress. Students stress about turning things in on time or being on their best behavior. While teachers stress about being nice to students, while still giving discipline. When a student is expected to complete such a large project such as a summer one, they get stressed. Yet if the student is able to be the one who designs and creates the project, it can have no stress involved. Stress is an important part of why students should be the ones designing summer projects but expectations put into place by the teacher play a part aswell.\n \n Expectations play quite the role these days, they cause people to flourish or dissapoint. Dissapointment is what will happen to those few students who never go above and beyond, but stay average if teachers design these projects. Students have many things to worry about during the school year, but during the summer theres not as many. Which is why something as small as this project can cause extreme harm to a student with a project designed by a teacher that requires them to go 100% and their only capable of 80%. This is why students need to design projects, so that everyone can get the score their expectations they believe.\n \n Expectations, stress levels and students doing the projects, are all reasons why students should be the ones to design summer projects and not teachers. Summer is a time of clarity for students and teachers alike, they dont have to worr about grades or waking up early to go to school and it should stay that why. All in all students and teachers both have their own strengths and weakness, but one of a students stregths is their ability to design summer projects.",

      "In Koea, there is a old saying that says \"Don't catch the fish for the kids, but teach them how to catch it.\" It means challenging itself is the only way to improve and it is better for people to learn for themselves instead of getting help on everything from other people. Some schools reuquire summer project for students during the break. Some teachers design the projects for their students, but some let their students to design them. Hoever, the summer projects should be student-designed for students' creativity and remembering the content.\n \n First, the summer projects should be student-designed because it helps the students to improve their creativity. When students design their own unique project, they have to come up with personal idea to imply on the project. Since they need their own idea, students have to think more about the theme, content, type of project, and all the things that they might want to put in the project. This process helps the students to think a lot deeper than teachers giving specific directions which helps to improve their creativity.\n \n Second, the summer projects should be student-designed becuase it helps the students to remember the learnings. When students design their own project, they need to remember and understand what they have learned during the school year well enough to evaluate into a project. It requires them to think about the contents for a long time and go through the notes or text books for informations. This process helps the students to reorganize the informations in their brain which eventually allows them to have longer memory on the learnings.\n \n However, even though student-designed summer projects help students to improve creativity and remember the content, there might be people who does not agree with this statement. Some might say that it takes too much time and effort to design the projects themselves and summer break is the time for the students to rest, spend time with their own family members and friends, and use their effort on extracurricular activities. However, they can arrange their schedule to make time for the projects and they can decide whether to make the project big or small. Other may argue that students might have hard time doing the project since it is not instructed. However, it is true that people improve and grow when they challenge themselves. It is better to have challenge for the students, which is the self-designed project. Also, since the students can design the project, they can design it to their own aility.\n \n Since it helps the students to improve their creativity and helps them to remember the lessons better, the summer projects should be student-designed. Challenging themselves is the only way for them to improve and have more experience. It is the better way of learning. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "As a high school student, school is very stressful to me. A big part of that stress has to do with big projects and tests that we have to do and take during school. The summer is our time to get off of school and take a break from learning but that would make it so much harder to get back to our normal routines when school rolls around again. Summer projects are the answer! The only thing wrong with them is that they don't engage the students because we aren't in the mood to do boring school work during our summer vacation. School projects done in the summer should be student-designed to increase willingness to participate, make students think creativley, and give the teachers a break from doing extra work over the summer.\n \n If summer projects were student-designed, students would be more willing to participate. When a teacher designs a project, students usually become bored and annoyed, while also dreading to do the work. If a student designed their own project, the work would be less boring and more fun. This would increase the students willingness to participate by giving them a project that they designed to fit to their likings.\n \n Student-designed summer projects would not only make the students use their brain when they are doing the project, but also make them use their brain while they are making it. The making of the project is a project in itself. This will force students to think creativley and use their minds. They will also be pushed into creating something they actually think is interesting as they will be the ones participating in it.\n \n Teachers, especially in high school, do so much planning throughout the year. If students took the time to design a project that would not only benefit the students, but it would give the teachers a break over their summer. All teachers would have to do is approve their students project and grade it. This would make add another pro to the column for student-designed projects as it would not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well.\n \n Student-designed summer projects have an overall benefit from teachers to students. They make students want to actually do the work, make the teachers life easier, and make the students use a more creative side of them. Although no student would like to do school work on their summer vacation, this is the best most efficient way to make them want to do it. Students will no longer start to dread projects if this is how they will be assigned. Student-designed summer projects are the best way to make this process easiest for everyone involved!",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. I think that these projects should be designed by the teacher. One reason why is because if the student are told to design it they are more than likely to not even do it. My second reason why is because some students might not know how to design their project. Reason three is that some students may design it themselves and make it so easy that they finish it in no time at all.\n \n One reason why I believe the summer project should be designed by the teacher is because; if the students are told to design it they are more than likely to not even do it. So what is the point in telling someone to do something knowing that they are not even going to do it. Some of the students are going to be lazy and when they are told to design and complete a project they are going to say to themselves, \"thats to much work.\" If the teacher designs the project and all they have to do is complete it the students are more likely to do the project. Some students are not going to do it weather the teacher designs it or they have to design it, however more students will do the project if they do not have to design it themselves.\n \n Reason two why is because some students might not know how to design their project. The students head might flow with so many ideas that they do not know which to pick. The student may not even know what the teacher means by design the project. The student may not be able to think of anyway to design the project. Or more simply put the student may not have the means to be able to design, nor make it.\n \n Reason three is that some students may design it themselves and make it so easy that they finish it in no time at all. I f the student gets to design the project they would figure out a way to make it so easy that they may finish it in a matter of days. If the student finishes the project in days how is the student going to continue learning for the rest of the summer. Even if the student doesn't make it easy on him/her self they still may finish quickly, however if the teacher designs the project he/she can make it more difficult for those who are smarter than some of the others. If the students get the project designed specifically for them it would take them more time which means they continue to learn all summer.\n \n Those are my three reasons why I believe that the teacher should design the summer project and not the students. Reason one was because if the students are told to design the summer project they are more than likely not even going to do it at all. Reason two was because some students might know how to design their project. Reason three was because some students may design it to where it's so easy they finish it in no time at all.Â Â",

      "Why is making summer projects student-designed a good option? If teachers created the summer projects, students willÂ not apply it to real life situations if possible, and will also may find no interest in the type of project they are being forced into completing. If summer assignments are student-designed, more students would take an interest and be willing to complete it.\n \n If the summer assignments are student-designed, then they may be more creative based. Students who are able to use creativity may enjoy completing the summer assignment, because they have the ability to use their interests to complete the assignment. For example, if a student needs to complete an assignment on aerodynamics for a science class, and they are interested in how planes work, they could go to an airport, or watch a movie on them. This would work as a student based project because,Â the student has an interest in airplanes so he would be able to apply his interests to the project assigned. He could find the formula that applies to making planes fly. Another example may be if a student needs to complete a science project on how photosynthesis works.Â This would work as a student based project because, if the student has an interest in art, they could use their drawing capabilities to their advantage and draw the process of photosynthesis out.Â Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can use creativity.\n \n If the summer assignments are student-designed, students will be able to brainstorm how they think is best fit to present and/or complete a project.Â An example of this is if a student is assigned a project from math to find the dimensions of anything, and explain why it is able to stand with those dimensions, they could choose whatever they see fit.Â This would work as a student based project because, the student has the ability to choose the item of his choice to find the dimensions of after brainstorming what his choice was.Â Another example of this may be for an art class, where the student is given multiple options to choose from as to what they wish to draw for the assignment.Â This would work as a student-designed project because, the student has the ability to choose what they want to select, and the assignment is not being forced upon them.Â Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can have the ability to choose from multiple options as to how they want to complete their project.\n \n Some people may disagree with this opinion. They may say that students need to be told how to do their assignment because otherwise it won't get done.Â But, if students are given the chance, those people can be proven wrong. Schools should have student-designed summer assignments because, they are independent.Â An example of this is when a student sees that chores need to be done at home and does them.Â This is an example because, the student is doing the chores without being told to by a parent or guardian.Â Another example of this is if a student takes to notice that it is almost time for dinner at their home, and their parents or guardians are running late from work, they begin to prepare dinner so that it is ready when their parents or guardians return home.\n \n When students have the ability to improve on their, creativity, independence and brainstorming skills, it can help them prepare for what the real world will throw at them.\n \n It will not only help them explore their strengths and weaknesses, but also help prepare them for when they graduate from college and get a job.Â Schools should make the summer assignments student-designed because, it will help improve their creativity, independence, and independent thinking skills (brainstorming skills).Â In conclusion, students should have the chance to complete student-designed summer assignments rather than teacher-designed.",

    Essay:
      "How would you like to do a boring project on your summer break? Doesn't sound fun, does it? Schools believe that during the summer students need to actively learn. They ensure students continue learning by giving them summer projects. The matter at hand is; whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. It is the students project, so why shouldn't it be designed by them? In most cases, teacher-designed projects are very detailed and include many parts, the teachers expect too much from the students. A student-designed project can ensure interest in the project, teacher-designed projects become boring and there's a lack of interest. During summer break many students will go on vacations or visit family, having the students design the projects assigned can allow them to take into account the time they have available.\n \n Teacher-designed projects are very intricate and the teachers expect too much from the students. Teachers have high standards. High standards can be good during the school year but for a summer project this can become very stressful. There are a plethoraÂ of components to a teacher-designed project, research, citations, outlines, rough drafts, and countless more. These projects force students to push themselves. Many might argue that its good for students to push themselves, but it is summer break after all and students have been pushing themselves for about ten months. These students are tired and adding stress to their vacation is cruel.\n \n Doing a project you're uninterested in can be very bland and boring. Teachers don't think about how uninteresting a topic or project can be to a student. Not having interest in a topic can be very detrimental to a students grade and the effort they put into the project. The same reaction can come from a boring class, students will start to loose focus, dread doing the work, or not put in any effort. I've personally experienced doing a project I had no interest in. I subconsciously procrastinated which lead to turning it in very late. I could not focus on the task and was drowning in work by the time it was due. If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in. This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new.\n \n Summer break is commonly associated with spending time with family and going on vacations. This is the case for most students. Giving students a long, details, mandated project is time consuming and takes away from their vacation. As a child of a divorced couple, my summers are filling with traveling to see my dad and spending time with him. I've personally experience having a summer project that I had to take time out of seeing my Father to do, which was upsetting because I only see him once a year. It's students like me who would love the chance to design their summer projects. Given the chance to design their summer project students can ensure for themselves that it will not take away from their own plans and it will encourage them to finish it in a more timely manner.\n \n Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation. These projects should be designed by the students. The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards. Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing. Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects. Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students. Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best. Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family. Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time. Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier. Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessaryÂ stress.",

      "Summer projects, even though most kids disagree with these being assigned in the summer, are a great way to make sure kids keep being productive and expanding their knowledge throughout the summer. That makes them very important since most kids detach themselves from school related activities in the summer and making students have a project done by the beginning of the school year, will make sure they are ready to come to school, be productive, and learn. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will make the student have more fun and expand their creativity while also assuringÂ the best results.\n \n Summer is about being able to do whatever and have fun. While some students believe that big summer projects could take away from the fun, making them student- designed will ensure that students make them based on things that they enjoy. Also, having students design their projects will make them really think and be creative. When grading these projects, teachers should partially grade them off of creativity. These types of projects can be truly amazing because they can show how creative kids can be when given time and a choice and show what great things they are capable of.\n \n Kids always do better when they are inspired and have the choice to do things their way. People are able to show their best when they are inspired and enjoy what they are doing. A great example of this can be seen in the workplace in the way that people that don't enjoy what they do for a living do not normally give the best results. This always applies to every one.\n \n Even though student-designed projects are great, teacher-designed projects are more predictable and easier to grade. If teachers design the projects, then most students will do similar things unlike with student-designed projects. If every student does something different, then the grading system for them will be a lot more complex making it a lot more difficult on the teachers.\n \n Although student-designed projects are unpredictable and more diverse. They promote all the good things about learning and make sure that they are making the best out of their summers. The positives completely outweigh the negatives since you are able to see the great potential all kids contain if they work on things that they are passionate about.Â  Â Â Â",

      "One time Generic_Name was in summer school and his teacher assigned him a project. He raised his hand and asked the teacher if the project was supposed to be student-designed or teacher-designed. The teacher said it will be teacher-designed because he thinks the students will slack off. Student-designed projects are to help students tell others about themselves. Student-designed projects help students and teachers to a greater good.\n \n Although some believe the summer projects should be teacher-designed because students do not have to come up with their own ideas, others believe the summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want, it allows teachers to learn more about the students, and it allows students to be themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want, it allows teachers to learn more about the students, and it allows students to be themselves.\n \n First, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want. For example, students will become more interested in the project if it is about what they want. Therefore, they will put more effort and more time into the project because they get to express themselves. If the students came up with the project idea then it is axiomatic they will complete the project. The project ideas the students choose directly reflects upon them, which means there is a higher chance they will be entitled to completing it. Furthermore, a student-designed project creates a sense of freedom in the students mind. To add to, if students get freedom on projects, then their academics will most likelyÂ skyrocket. In summary, student-designed summer projects encourage students to complete it with hard workÂ and perseverance.\n \n Second, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the teachers to learn more about the students. These projects give off a sense of how the teachers should treat the students. For example, if the student does poorly on the project and is very weak in presenting, then the teacher should know what to do. The teacher should gather the information and come to a conclusion which states that the student needs help. However, if a student does a really emotional and heart touchingÂ project then the teacher should get involved. The teachers should try and communicate with the students and sympathize towards them, and maybe even take it a little easy on them since they are going through a tough time. If a student presents a project which is reflecting on their past and the obstacles they overcame, then the teacher should ask questions. In other words, they should try and learn more about the students past, so the teachers will have an understanding of how they can help the students in the future. To put it all together, student-designed summer projects should be a way for the teachers to truly learn and understand about how the students are where they are.\n \n Third, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the students to be themselves. For example, students should feel free about doing a project. They should not have to be held to a standard which they might never get to. Teachers should rather help the students get to the standard rather than just telling the students they have to get there. In projects, students should be able to talk about whatever they choose to. They should not have to be limited to one project idea. To add to, limiting what students have to do a project is how their grades start to drop. One of the most important thing a student should be able to do on a student-designed summer project is to express their feelings and talk about what their heart tells them to do. The whole point of a student-designed project should be to help students talk about what is bothering them instead of limiting them to one idea. In one idea, student-designed summer projects should be a way for students to be unique and different in a world where everyone is trying to be like each other.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are a way for students to express their deepest feelings and their wildest dreams. If summer projects are student-designed, then teachers will know how each student should be taught. Students should confront their teachers and tell them why their summer projects should be student-designed.Â",

      'For a better student performance and development, I think teachers should design summer projects, to assure we still learning while we are out of school. Teachers always have clear objectives and they know everything that might support our learning process. I think that teachers have also the biggest background knowledge that we will need, I mention that because teachers always will be there to support us in whatever we need and to see our performance as a students. An adult person always would see things different than us, In this case teachers are the best persons that will evaluate what we have, or what we have to work on because of the knowledge that they have already mastered.\n \n Teachers always have clear objectives an they also know on which part of our school development we are on, and what elseÂ do we need to success. It seems like projects are not necessary, but for sure they are; because the knowledge that we acquire from those projects is not only helping us just while we are at school, if not that it is the key to success. However, teachers knows what we need to work on, and we just pick whatever is faster and easier to make without taking care of the knowledge that we are not acquiring, just because we want to spent time watching our cell phones playing video games or simply doing something non-related to the school.\n \n I feel that teachers have the biggest knowledge and experience than anybody because of their journey. And a clear example of experienced people is Mrs.Â Generic_Name, my English teacher is a woman full of experience, that is why I respect her so much and also try to do everything well as she do. She have something special that motivates me to put my best effort on learn everything I do day by day, because I know that experienced people always tells everyone the right and if they ask someone to do not do something is because it already happened to him/her and they know the consequences of doing that.\n \n Sometimes when a teacher or just someone else told us that something is wrong in our work, being honest before we analyze and find our mistake we get mad at them, but all that they want is to let us know where do we need to keep on practicing to success. Having a teacher design projects would be better to review what we need and not what we want, and then when someone revises our work have all the requirements that they asked for instead of we making our own project without requirements and when someone revise this we are just going to invent thousands of excuses about why did not made it well.\n \n I believe that having a teacher design projects is a better option for us to continue learning because we all still learning day by day, but we have to place on practice what we already know until we mastered that.

      "Students look forward to summer time in order to relieve the stress of the school year.\n \n Many students enjoy the summer break between transitioning into a new grade, however students dread the summer project that comes along with the break. Students are assigned summer assignments that are designed by teachers to keep students minds working, however it serves no purpose to students inÂ their daily life. Consequently, students are forced to do summer projects that are irrelevant and do little to teach them anything. Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity, teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences, and students are more likely to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity. For example, when my brother was assigned an open ended science project, he decided to build an exploding volcano with fossils hidden inside. He was not a fan of book work, and he had felt his teacher had finally given the students a chance to make something exciting that would surprise the whole school. As evidenced by the example, my brother wanted to show his creative side and give his classmates an interesting show that would excite the class about science. By the teacher letting him design his own project he was able to come up with an idea that would excite people and a display others would enjoy watching.Â When students are given the chance to be creative in school they take the opportunity because they want to associate school subjects with fun and show off their creative skills.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be student designed because teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences. For example, if a student designs a project on how height affects a persons ability to play basketball the teacher is now aware that student has an interest in basketball.\n \n By allowing students to design their own project the teacher is able to learn about each students likes and dislikes and what they are interested in. This in turn allows the teacher to make lessons more relevant to what the students prefer and allows the students to connect the subjects to their interests. Teachers are also seen as friends to the students because the teacher expresses interest in the students lives. This also promotes high grades in the class and students are able to have a good connection and relationship with the teacher. By allowing students to design their own summer projects it could lead the teacher forming healthy relationships with students to promote a healthy learning environment.\n \n Lastly, summer project should be student designed because students are more likely to complete the project. For example, my friend was assigned a history time lineÂ by one of her teachers and decided she was not going to do it, however her English teacher told them to create a project on any book of her choice and she finished it all in one day. As evidenced by this example, students are more driven to complete a task when it is a task of their choice and everything is determined on their terms. Students are rarely ever given an option on how to complete a project, so when given a chance to have complete control over how they do an assignment they jump at the opportunity because for once they are able to determine and decide what they want to do without the guidelines of anyone else. Additionally, students are able to convey their ideasÂ across in their own way which makes them happy because they only have to answer to themselves and everything is done their way. Students choose not to complete work when other people assign it with stipulations, however when everything is their choice they have no problem completing a project because it becomes a way to express themselves.\n \n Many people may say teachers get paid to create projects and assignments, however allowing students to design their own summer projects allows teachers to get to know students, students are more likely to complete the project, and allows students to be creative. It can be difficult to help promoteÂ learning over summer break, however by getting students engaged in the choice of projects it can be fun for the student and teacher. Students today are more creative than ever and it is important to help kids remain creative throughout their lives so new inventions and discoveries are made. School holds the foundation of the future and it is important to nurture the future leaders of the world. Students are the key to the future and innovation and it is crucial people let them have control and feel important.Â",

Some students do like to read and write instead of experienceÂ it and their friend should know that. Many student are looking for jobs in the summer break so they can make some cash and get experienceÂ for the future when they get a job. ExperienceÂ something can be totally different than reading about it like diving, traveling, and playing sport. Some things are better to experienceÂ than reading.\n \n Some people may say teacher should design the summer break project, however; summer project should be student-designed because it is their time, they know what a better design for them, and some students like toÂ experienceÂ the real worldÂ insteadÂ of doing project. Some students get depressed because of school and sometimes leaving them to do design their project may help them get better.",

      "Projects over summer break should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed so it provides a challenge, provides a glimpse of how the class will be taught, and if complications were to occur the certain individual can contact the teacher.\n \n If students designed the summer projects they would make it easy for them to complete. The projects should require hard work and effort, as opposed to little effort if designed by a student. The project wouldnt be preposterous, just hard enough so that a challenge is provided.\n \n Students can become accustomed to his or her teaching methods. Also, it helps parents know what to do if later on during the year the student is having complications. Scholars can better prepare themselves ahead of time if they're confused about the methods.\n \n Teachers can easily contact the student. In addition to that, the student can also contact the teacher if they have further questions or problems. If this was student-designed it'll be hard for the professor to reach the particular student or group.\n \n Over the summer, teachers believe that students will forget information that they just learned during the school year. So due to that matter, debates over if projects should be assigned during summer break are still controversial till this day. summer projects will make teens become more responsible and make them manage their time wisely. On the other hand, they'll come into school on top of that particular subject.",

      "I think that the summer project should be student-designed. A big reason as to why it should be student-designed is the students should beÂ able to understand the project without needing help from the students teacher. They won't have their teachers at home. If the project was teacher-designed it most likely would'nt make sense to a majorityÂ amount of the students. Regardless either its student-designed or teacher-designed they should beÂ able to learn something from it.\n \n Teachers assign projects for classes that they know they're going to needÂ to remember certain material. My freshman history teacher had assigned a packet for a class I was taking the next year (AP human geography). Not many students had done it due to the fact that it was very complex and very teacher-designed. There was a lack of motivation because, students didnt find much interest. Most teachers dont think that,that effects a students work effort. Having a student-designed project makes students understand it more, have motivation to do it, and also, have it complete on time.\n \n Everything students have done throughout the whole year had been teacher-designed, having one project during their summer student-designed would really motivate them to do their best and take their time onto doing their best. As a student I say this because,to me this is true. I feel most motivatedÂ when I can connect to my school work. Its our project we will spend the most time withÂ it, why not make it ourÂ own? Most students dont want to do school work during summer break, I mean who wouldÂ ? but if there is no way of stopping the work fromÂ coming why not let it be a time to learn for ourselves and it the project be in our hands fully.\n \n I think summer projects should be student-designed, give us our chance to make school work outside of school our own.",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning durning their break. To be certain, students are continuesly learning some schools support the idea of projects assigned durning the students summer break. Those who agree with this idea believe that summer projects will help student for the year to come. Others who disagree beileve summer break should not be invaided by school work. For summer projects to be effective it should be teacher-designed because the teacher is an experts, knows student limites, and knows if the students will put forth effort into the project.\n \n For teachers to have to ablilty to teach a specific class they require a certain degree level in that subject, making that teacher an expert. For example if an earth science teacher were to assign a summer project on the earth's layers that teacher could take a complicated subject, and explain it in a simple way for students to understand. From talking about the earths core elements to how our earth looks the way it does today. These difficult topics for students to understand can be simplified because the teacher is an expert on those lessons. Now summer projects can be better understand when the teacher explains the topic in the correct way.\n \n Through out the year teachers learn to how their students best learn and understand a topic. Meaning the teacher will know how much of a work load his or her students can take. Having this in mind the teacher will be able to prolong or shorten the students summer project to their ability. Students stress over many small unmeaningful things. A teacher having that in mind will cut back or lengthen the amount of work students will be required to do through out the summer. So students can still be able to enjoy and relax durning summer break.\n \n While knowing students limits with how much work his or hers students can undertake, the teacher will also now if the students will care enough to put effort into their summer project. Again teachers know how their students will behave with the amount of work given over the summer, and if the student will put effort into their project. Given the fact that it is summer and students will want to get the project done and over with the student best efforts will not be put in. So with that in mind the teacher will have to in a extra credit or a prize to make sure the student will try their best and complete the summer project.\n \n Inconclusion having a teacher-designed summer project will help students learn in the best way possible because of their ability to simplify complicated topics. Lessen or increase the amount of work the students will be required to do by knowing their knowloge capability. And lastly knowing the amount of effort a student will put forth into the project. By giving to student a prize or extra credit for completeing the project with the students best effort. That is why summer project should be teacher-designed. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Requiring students a summer project to extend their academic progression is extremely intelligent, however should the summer project be teacher- designed or student- designed. For me this is simple, letting students design their project would give them control of their summer the way they desire, could become an amazing social experience, and give a chance to show their creativity.\n \n To begin with, the summer is basically one of the only times student get a break from school and no student wants to have to work during it, but allowing them to design their own project gives them the opportunity to work out how and what their going to do and can provide them a much more manageableÂ schedule. Allowing them to fit in any other activities they wanted to indulged in that summer. Such as, summer camps, road trips, internships, etc. Then both parties are happy and fulfilled with what happened that summer.\n \n Secondly, depending on how the students go about the design of their project it could become an extremely fun social experience. Especially when interacting with peers on what topic their going to do, coming together to making groups and working on the project over break, showing each other designs, and giving opinions on each others topics. This could become very fun and memorable experience for these young adults and impact them for the rest of their lives.\n \n furthermore, as educational as school is it lacks one major and crucial thing, creativity. schools can be extremely bad when it comes to providing a platform to express yourself on, but giving students the ability to design their own project can incorporate their style in whatever way they choose. Instead of force feeding them a topic they have no interested in, inevitably causing reluctant behavior towards the project. Being in tune with your creative side creates a entrepreneurs mindset, allowing you to think outside box getting you away from common thinking.\n \n In Conclusion, allowing students to design their own project can come with many benefits. Providing them the freedom needed to enjoy the summer, independent thinking, social skill, and most importantly creativity. And all these life skills from giving the task of one simple project. Â",

      "Firstly a teacher or a student to design a summer project. Most students would say to let them design it. But with this generation the smartest choice would be to let the teacher do it. Because they're the ones with the experience with making these projects. If they told me to sit down and make a project I wouldn'tÂ even know where to begin. Like kids these days barely know how to tie their own shoe. One expects them to do a whole project for them to do in the summer.\n \n Teachers literally learned how to teach, how to make test/projects, how to make it make sense and not be all over the place, also how to make it fun for the student. Teachers study for how many years four or five for what to let a student do their job and make their own project. The student isn't learning anything from making his own project. The only real thing they would learn is how to put a project together. But if I had to do it I wouldn't even learn that I would try to make the project simple for me so I wouldn't have to do a lot of work.\n \n Also kids these days have gotten really lazy, for example, my little sister in the summer she doesn't do anything but be on her phone and in bed all day. I couldn't imagine her doing a project in the summer nor lessÂ make one. A student wouldn't make the project difficult they would make it as easy as possible. They would probably make themselvesÂ just draw a picture of what they did in the summer. Students don't want to learn in the summer that's their time off when they get a break. No student that I know wants to do any work in the summer and most kids I know wouldn't even do it.\n \n I remember getting a project in the summer when I was in the sixth grade. The teacher also made it and to be honest it was a large project but it help. The next year when we reviewed when we came back from summer I wasn't lost I still remembered a lot of information because of that project. But if a student had made it he wouldn't even know what to put on it. I would've been screwed because I would've done a project a kid made that didn't even know what we learned about that year. Teachers just knows what to put it together and how to organize it and that helps a lot.\n \n If they just let teachers do it and make the projects students would learn more then if a student made it. We also always get those kids that don't do it either way. Just let the teachers do their job and make it they have more experience then a kid thatÂ is justÂ always on their phone. The student also has a better chance of actually learning if the teacher makes it, then if the student made it themselves. In the end of the day the program just wants to make kids learn and get the information they need. So just the the professionals do it.Â",

      "Some schools think that students should keep learning over the summer. I think that the project should be student designed. If we are doing the project we should be able to design it to. Think if the does the design and we don't know it we can't ask because it's summer. Now let me tell you how it would be better if we designed the project instead of the teachers.\n \n If the students design the project it could be more understanding for them. Which is a big help for them and so they an get a higher grade. We could do more research on what we know and we can put down some facts that the internet doesn't know. Like if a basketball player plays a certain amount of games the internet would know but they wouldn't know their play style that the teacher or internet didn't know. The internet doesn't know everything and neither does the teacher so you should design the project yourself.\n \n Say if the teacher designed the project and you have to look up research on the subject it might not have all the truth on the internet. The teacher may know may know more than the internet about the project which makes it unfair to the student. Thats why the student should be designing the project thats why the students should design the project. Like if the BET awards was coming on televisionÂ the teacher may know when its coming on but you could know who the special guest coming on the show. The teacher could not know that but thats why you could inform them on that when the project is done.\n \n The teacher knows you likes shoes so the teacher asigns you a project about shoes. So you go to do your research about some shoes you have so you look them up and it doesnt say their limited edition. So you have to tell your teacher the shoes aren't regular shoes and your teacher says yes they are and you say no their not. You show your teacher that their limited edition basket ball shoes and you corrected your teacher so the teacher gets mad and gives you a lower grade on the project when you got a 100 for the project. Therefore you should design your own project so the teacher doesnt get mad if you correct them on something.\n \n So you just learned that you should design you own projects. So you can look up the right fatcs on your project instead of listening to the internet or teachers. Or tell your teachers whats going to happen on a certain show and spoil it for them. Or tell them how a certain player plays the basketball game when they play as hard as they can against the hardest team. Or get a bad grade because of correcting the teahcer on a type of shoes that are limited edition. Moral of the story students should design their own projects.Â",

      "A project over the summer is a great idea for students to continue to learn. On the other hand, allowing teachers to decide on what students should create isn't the best idea. In the summertime, students love to have fun, create new things, and discover. Leaving the project up to them could challenge their creativity and work ethic. It's not only fun for students, but fun for teachers to see what the students bring back.\n \n During my fifth grade science fair, we were allowed to conduct any experiment we wanted. I decided to blow bubbles and see which gum brand made the biggest bubble. This was fun to do because it was what I thought that made it a successful project. In my opinion, I became proud of myself for taking initiative for completing the assignment on my own.\n \n In addition, when it was time to present my own work I didn't have any problems. I knew what I was talking about and it gave me confidence in front of the class. Sharing all the information I was articulate and when answering questions I was assertive. My teacher was surprised with the quality of my lab and she knew I had put lots of time and effort into this.\n \n Nevertheless, In a teachers perspective of giving a controlled project to students is necessary. They don't always see where things could go wrong. A student could be confused about instructions and do the project completely wrong. Some might feel like it's boring and a waste of time. Giving the student the freedom to illustrate and present their own idea is the most creative way to learn.\n \n Therefore, students designing their own project ideas surpass teachers. Making it fun to learn instead of what might feel like a burden. Teachers determine effort and creativity for the most part. It's up to students to demonstrate correctly.

      "Learning is an experienece that will follow you where ever you go. A key element of learning is the ablity to retain the information. The three months that students are given during the summer break shouldn't be completely wasted. It is easy to sit back and forget everything you've dedicated your nine months in school to. This is why a teacher-designed summer project is crucial. These summer projects help student's retain the information and get them ready for their classes next year. Summer projects should always be teacher designed that way the information is effective and reliable. A student designed project won't be as effective as a teacher designed project due to the their excitement towards summer break. Student's will always find an easy way out of things and that is why a teacher is there, to maintain authority and educate! I believe that mandatory summer projects should always be teacher designed so that student's get the best and effective education.\n \n Summer break is definetly a time for students to relax and find peace from school. That dosen't mean that you should forget school completely until the first day comes around. Many students struggle on the first semester because they are not mentally and physically prepared. Summer projects are sort of like the student's wake up call for the soon to come school year. Proper preparation is important for anything, especially if it reflects on your future. Starting your high school year strong is fundamental to maintaning your grades throughout the school year. An effective summer project can help get to you ready for your classes and keep the ball rolling. A teacher designed project will help prepare you for the school year but will also balance the \"fun\" part of it. A student-designed project will be more fun and then actual learning. A teacher can effectivly design a project that can balance both the fun and the learning part so that student's can get the best of both worlds. Nevertheless, if your required to do a summer project, it might as well be helpful to your learning. At the end of the day, it's about mind over matter.\n \n Many students don't realize how important high school actually is to your future. I mean, they are still young and need guidence. Which is why they shouldn't design the project that they ultimately have to complete. Students only come into class for a grade and not actually to learn. Student's will take any chance they have to improve their grade. This is why a student-designed project is not the best benificial to their own good. Kids precieve school as somewhere they have to be and that's completely normal. No one actually wants to go out and learn, which is why teachers are there to help. They teach and educate students while keeping an engaging enviorment. Teacher's have been students once and know what they have to do to balance fun with work. Summer should be a time for relaxation and preperation.\n \n Many will argue that if students are required to do an assignment then why can't they design it? I mean, they are required to be at school! Plus, this is their break time so aren't they entitled to it? This all stems down to what is best for the students. If it were up to the students, they wouldn't even put a summer assignment! Or homework for that case. At the end of the day, its benificial to the students and will only help them. Teacher can find the balance between fun and work, where as students would be all fun and no work. Summer projects should be a refresher and a tool to prepare! Not an easy grade.\n \n In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are far more benificial to students then student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects are proper and will help prepare students for next year. Teacher's were students once and know how to properly balance the project for the best of both worlds. Student's don't know what's best for them and lack expierence. The essential part about learning is to retain and use the information to benifet you. Teacher's want to see the best for them and see them suceed. Education will be apart of everyone's life and they have to learn to accept it. Your grades will impact your future and should be taken seriously. Proper preparation will help keep students to maintan good grades. At the end of the day, it comes down to hard work and hard work brings results.",

      "The summer is a time for students to enjoy a break from schoolwork. Most students spend their time on vacation or relaxing. Summer projects may impede on students' time to relax, and they may take away their freedom. It is the students' break, so they may want to decide what projects they have to do. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the students to do projects they are interested in and that work with their summer schedule.\n \n Student-designed projects will interest students more than teacher-designed projects. Many students don't want to do anything school related over the summer. By assigning them projects, they have to take time to do something they don't want to do. However, if the projects were student-designed, they would be more likely to complete them since they designed them themselves. These projects would make the students use their creativity, which would lead to more of them expressing their interests. They will be much more motivated to do a project that interests them than a project made and given to them by a teacher.\n \n Many students travel and have plans over the summer. Consequently, they may not have time to do teacher-designed projects. If the students designed their own projects, they would be able to design them to fit their schedule. With this flexibility, students will stress less about finding time for the project. Therefor, students will produce better projects because they aren't stressed. This flexibility allows students to do their best and get the most out of doing school work in the summer.\n \n Many people think that the freedom of student-designed projects will allow students to be lazy and off topic. However, this freedom gives the students the opportunity to turn schoolwork into something that interests them, thus motivating them to do well. The summer is a break for students to relax and not worry about school. School projects take away from that, but the student-designed projects give more flexibility than those made by teachers. Therefor, summer projects should be student-designed in order to grab students' interest and not impede on their break.",

      "The youth are the leaders of tomorrow. This is often said by older individuals regarding the upcoming generation. As a leader, one often has to make many decisions and develop designs for numerous events and plans. In order to prepare the youth for this role, they should be given assignments that allow them to design and solve situations. School is one of the various places where the youth can practice this skill. Summer projects assigned to student should be student-designed because project would be of high quality,Â students will better retain the information that they learn and the students are motivated to complete the project.\n \n The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is due to the fact that the completed projects would be of high quality. Students will invest copious amounts of time and effort in order to complete the project that they have designed. This was seen with chemistry students, at Generic_School, who designed their own lab involving a unit taught in class. Those students spent an extended amount of time investing and researching information that they needed to conduct the lab that they designed. The students also spent hours in lab, running through numerous trials and collecting data. The dedication that theses students possesÂ displays the lengths the students may go to, so they can complete their self designed project. The large amount of effort and time that students put into their project results in high quality work because students have a deep understanding of the topic and strong application which is illustrated in their project. Schools should assign student-designed summer projects as the completed project would be of high quality.\n \n The second reason that schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed is because students will better retain the information that they learn. When students are given the power to design their own project, they are more attentive to the information that they are gathering. This was seen with history students, at Generic_School, who conducted research and wrote a paper on a social group during World War II. When going through sources and evaluatingÂ them, students paid close attention to the dates and originÂ of the sources. This was helpful for students as it prevented them from wasting time on sources that were not beneficial for their paper. Students were also able to have deep conversations with each other about the various socials groups using the information that they had learned online. Assigning student-designed projects for the summer should be done because students will better retain the information that they learn.\n \n The final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students would be more motivated to complete the project. When giving students the freedom to design a project that they will be working on for almost three months, empowerment is often felt by students as they believe that they are respected and trusted enough to develop a project based off of their own design. This empowerment causes students to have more desire to complete the project, and theÂ projects will be completed to high level of satisfaction.Â This can also be seen when a parent tells their child to make a meal for dinner. The child feels empowered since they have the freedom to create whatever dish they like; the empowerment that the child feels motivates the child to complete the task to a high satisfaction level. Student-designed the summer projects would also result in eagerness from the students. Since students have the ability to design their project, they would be more inclined to create a design that is interesting to them. This interest would make students eager as they will want to see the results of their plans.\n \n Student-designed summer projects should be assigned by schools because students' motivation to complete the project would increase.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects would be less time consuming for students;however, teacher-designed projects would not prepare students for the upcoming school. During the school year, students are often required to create their own essay, lab design and presentation by teachers for a grade. Students completing a design that they have created will allow them to practice skills that teachers will require during the school year.\n \n Overall, summer projects assigned by schools should be student-designed because the completed projects would be of high quality, students will better retain the information that they learn and students would be more motivated to complete the project. These reasons should encourage schools that assign summer project to allow the projects to be student-designed.",

      "Although frowned upon student, summer work, more specifically summer projects are a great way to assure students continue learning during their break and to prevent any halts in their learning process. To maximize the potential gains, these summer projects should be student-designed, as doing so would enable students to be more creative, allow students to focus on what they need to improve, and it would increase student initiative and interest.\n \n Firstly, student-designed summer projects are a great way to enable student creativity. By giving students the option to design and come up with their project (which is, of course, in relation to the class/course), it gives them an opportunity to use their creative minds which they rarely get to use due to the general school structure. In life, it's usually the most creative and unique things that are recognized and viewed highly. For example, in a school science fair, rather than the cliche volcano winning, first place would usually go to something more unique or creative. The same idea can be applied outside of school. For example, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk is most well known not just for these companies, but for the incredibly unique and more creative way he manages and runs the businesses, and the way he conducts himself as a businessmen. Through his creative personality, Elon Musk has managed to expand his businesses and appeal to the more casual audience as a fun, regular guy.\n \n In addition to allowing creativity, student-designed projects would allow students to focus on their weaknesses, or in areas they have interest in but previously didn't have the opportunity to delve into. By allowing students to have more control over their projects, it can help students focus on their weaknesses, thus allowing for greater improvement and preparedness heading into the school year. In addition to this, such a project could allow a student to kick startÂ or advance a certain interest, which could prove instrumental to their future. Most people somewhat figure out what they want to do in life by the time they finish school anyways, but having a flexible summer project, especially with the amount of time you would have to research and work on it, could really help with that decision. In addition to finding interests, student-designed projects can also help students identify what they aren't interested, or what their strengths are. Through extensive research and work, students can figure out their strengths and work to them, or find what doesn't interest them and make sure to stay away in order to avoid a future situation where they end up in a class or even job that doesn't enable them to try and work hard.\n \n Finally, by allowing students to have more control and design their projects, it would increase student interest and initiative for the topic at hand. As a student, I have personally found, that while student-designed projects may take longer, they have generally allowed me to connect more with the class and find aspects about the course that interest me. These sorts of projects have also allowed me to take more initiative in my class, by making me think more critically and spend more time coming up with what to do. For example, I once had a project where we had to look at a certain global issue, but we could choose to look from whatever perspective we wanted. After hours of thinking and trying to find an interesting perspective, I came upon an article discussing the view of economists, and, obviously, the way they thought that situation would impact the economy. As one thing lead to another, I ended up thoroughly researching a multitude of different resources and I learned a lot about economics. It was from that one project where I realized how interesting economics is to me, as it just seems to make sense and can be easily applied to the world. This project has resulted in me being in an AP economics class today. There are many others that have had their interests derive from one small moment, and a student-designed project provides a great chance for students to take intiative and find an interest that could lead on to be a great part of their lives.\n \n In summary, while teachers are the experts and know how to get students to learn, directing the project to students by making summer projects student-designed would be more beneficial to students individually. By enabling them to be creative, focus on their interests and weaknesses, and by increasing student initiative, student-designed projects are the best way to assure students get the most out of summer projects.",

      "Summer vacation is often regarded as the most ejoyable time a student can have in year. Although many students enjoy this time, the content they learned at school can be lost in the festvities. To ensure this does not happen, schools should hand out a required summer assignment of the students' choosing. By letting the students choose, they will be more interested in the topic of the project, more inclined to further study the topic they chose beyond the requirements of the projects and said project will decrease the probability of a student forgetting the material learned during the school year.\n \n Students are far more likely to complete an assignment to the best of their ability if they are interested in what they're doing. The usual projects assigned by teachers are often boring and can be done well enough for a good grade in around an hour of solid work. However, if the student is passionate about the project they will go above and beyond in order to inform their teachers and peers about the topic they have chosen. Students who pick their own project get to show off what they know and what they've learned which is a huge incentive in and of itself.\n \n Students that pick their topic may get so interested in what they're doing that they dive into deeper thought about the subject, a useful learning experience that can be beneficial in all walks of life, or do more research for the joy of doing it rather than for the grade. This will enrich the students education with learning strategies and techniques not often taught at school. It will also persuade them to fall in love with the joy of learning new things and, as a result, their educational performance will drastically increase. In addition students could find a passion in what they're researching providing a goal for the student which will also increase academic performance. For example, I found what I'd like to major in at college through a project I got to choose. It also provided me with an opportunity to think outside the box, something i rarely get the chance to do at school.\n \n Student forgetting information is an issue all schools face. The first month of school is often spent doing review which wastes time in the long run. If students did just one project over the long break, they are less likely to forget what they learned the previous year. The project would have certain guidlines that would touch on each of the core subjects, namely: science, math, language arts and history. By doing this, students will apply the skills learned in the classroom to something their interested in.\n \n In conclusion, students who pick their projects are more likely to acquire new, useful learning skills outside of the classrom, retain the information learned at school and finally, fully apply themselves in an effort to show off their knowledge and spread their passion.Â",

    Essay:
      "How would you feel if you had to complete school work over the summer? Well, I believe you'd say the same as I would school work over the summer is beyond boring. What if you were able to complete your school work in a creative way? Some schools now require their students to complete summer projects to advance their learning. This is beneficial overall to help the students not forget material they learned that they will need the next upcoming school year. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so that students are still advancing their knowledge on subjects they've learned in school, also, so there is no debate over grades since all students would have the same topic and rubric, and lastly, because there's no question on if it relates to their school work.\n \n Teacher-desgined projects have requirements needed to be meet in order to advance the students knowledge in topics specific to what they have learned in their class. While it recaps what you have already learned, this gives you an opportunity to go deeper and explore the topic more. For example, Generic_Name is in Psychology class, her teacher Mrs. Generic_Name provided a project to be completed over the summer about the frontal lobe of the brain. Generic_Name not only has already learned about the brain and the frontal lobe, but now she has a chance to research and understand the frontal lobe at a more advanced point of view. Teacher-designed projects have more of an advantage towards students learning so they learn about a topic in class, but also on their own.\n \n Grades is an important part of every student's life. Teacher-designed projects allow for teachers to provide a rubric or guideline sheet on how they will grade the project so there are no questions for why you recieved a low grade on the assignment. Some teachers will leave feedback on their rubric sheets as to why you did bad, but you can't always rely on that so it's important that the student understands all the requirements and what the teacher is looking for. Teacher-designed projects give the student a chance to stick up for what the teacher told them because they have what they told them to do on paper or on a computer.\n \n Risks related to school could be very rewarding or detramental to the student. Would you want to take the risk of having a teacher tell you your project isn't relevant to what your learning or have learned? With teacher-designed projects there is little to no risk on if the topic relates to your school work or not. Teachers give you a specific topic if it's a teacher-designed project. Overall, the risk of the topic not being relevant would be detramental to a students grades.\n \n Student-designed projects allows a chance for the students to take advantage and call anything they do over the summer their project. Also, they have the risk of a debate over the way you grade the student because there are no guidelines or rubrics. Student-designed projects take many risks that could cause many different problems. Overall, teacher-desgined projects are the best route to take when it comes to summer projects.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Many people believe that projects should be teacher-designed but i do not. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.\n \n First, more students will be into it. If a student does a project on their favorite movie, superhero, celebrity, etc. they will have more fun doing that. Let's say a teacher told their students to do a project on Abraham Lincoln, the students probably wouldn't be very happy about that. However, if a teacherÂ told their students to do a project on their favorite TV show, then I'm sure that students would actually be excited about it.\n \n Secondly, students can have fun while learning. If they did a project on their favorite movie, they could watch that movie and tell the class and teacher about all the funny, happy, and sad moments. You could also learn a lotÂ of history by doing a project on your favorite movie, because you'll have to learn about the history on why they made the movie.\n \n Third, they don't have to be forced into dong a boring project a teacher chooses. Nobody ever wants to write a paper on history and wars. If the students got to choose about what their project could be on it would be a lotÂ better and easier to get a student to actually do it. If you tell a student to do a project on World War 1, chances are they won't do it, or they will put it off until the last minute. A student could actually be excited to do a project if they got to choose what it was about.\n \n In conclusion,Â Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.Â",

      "Kobe Bryant is known for his signature jump shot, the Fade-away. It's unique, it's effective, and it's his style. In the classroom, every student dreads the word \"project\". Projects are meant to test comprehension on a given topic. The problem with teacher-designed projects is that they are boring and predictable. The teacher-designed projects also have specific guidelines, which doesn't allow students to expand their thinking and express their knowledge in a way they would like to. Summer school projects should be student-designed because it allows students to show their own creativity, the students would put in effort with something they are passionate about, and teacher-led projects are too basic.\n \n Lamar Jackson and LeBron James strive in their respective sports for one reason, their style. If every athlete were to shoot the basketball the same way, or throw the football the same way, then there would be no point in watching the games! These sporting events are exciting because every athlete has their own style of play. The same could be said in the classroom. If every student in a class presented a slide showÂ or an essay for their project, I bet the teacher would fall asleep in an instant! Student-designed projects gives the opportunity for the students to really show their creativity and understanding in a way that is special to them. For example, a student who has musical talent could write a song about their project, or an athlete could make a game for their project. The options are endless! The purpose of a project is to test the students' knowledge on a given subject, so why not let them do it their way?\n \n Imagine sitting through a class where every single student presented with a slide show; It's so simple that a baby could make the same project. Teacher-designed projects don't give the opportunity for students to really show how well they understand the topic. Repetition in the classroom is very toxic. Having the same boring project guideline for every student doesn't engage the students in any way at all. The student-designed projects show diversity and creativity; on the other hand, teacher-designed projects are extremely dull and unoriginal. The teacher-designed projects have such a strict rubric that makes the students roll their eyes. The biggest flaw of it all is that the students are only trying to satisfy the teacher, rather than trying to fully comprehend the subject.\n \n When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. In the classroom, students would put in a tremendousÂ amount of effort if they were given the chance to do a project in their own way. Whenever I get a project assigned, I tell myself that I will start working on it the next day. If I were able to put my own twist on a project, I might be able to finish the whole assignment in one day!\n \n The way Carlos Santana strums a guitar is iconic and infamous; no other living creature can imitate his style. In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting. A teacher-designed project is a vanilla ice cream cone, while a student-designed project is an ice cream cone with nuts, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.Â",

    Essay:
      "Summer, as known throughout the whole world, is for relaxation. Now when it comes to students, summer is a school free zone, mentally and physically. Though some teachers believe it is a smart idea to give the students projects or summer reading so they wouldn't forget some of the school work and already have a review over the summer when they come back. That is always expected when schools start back, though not all the students that were assigned to do the assignments did them because they either didn't understand the task correctly or they just wanted to enjoy summer and not think about any school work. That causes both the students and the teachers to be irritated and dissapointed. However, that could be changed by just one small upgrade.\n \n For years, school systems and teachers have been assigning students lessons that they will either never use in the real life or lessons the students don't understand or don't want to learn because the topics don't interest them. Many studies have shown the peak of the students grades is when they are being taught about modern day conflicts or societies, or just topics that interest them. That shows the students want to learn about what relates to them or something they actually want to learn about. Also, some students want to actually earn their grade. As surprising as it is, students want to do their work, because they want to be happy when they get the \"A\" and say that they deserved it because they worked hard on the assignment. Though not all of them can do that because not all of them might understand the assignment. Here, is where the upgrading comes in handy.\n \n School systems need to find new ways of education and renew all of the \"traditional\" ways of teaching. The systems need to understand that these generations are becoming more complicated to teach because of all the new modern trends and technologies. It is becoming easier for the students to understand the lessons from their peers and not the teachers, because it is becoming more difficult each day for the teachers to connect with their students. That is usually either because of social distractions or lack of good communication between the teacher and their students. Though if the teachers and the systems started renovating and thinking about new ways such as: letting the students choose their own topics of what they want to do for summer projects. They can just start from the summer projects, start it off small and see how much of an effect that will make and if it comes out with a pretty positive effect then take action during the actual school months.\n \n Every student does not wish or even want to keep having bad grades in school. Especially because of minor things or because they think they are not smart enough to succeed like their peers. Taking effect in letting students choose what they want to do for their summr projects will make a huge imapct on how the students will learn when they go back to school. That will also affect how the school systems view students learning and will see that it's the best choice to start upgrading their teaching system to the more modern ways. Students will want to actually do their assingments because they will know what they are do it and actually understand it. They will even enjoy what they are doing because they know they will do good because they worked hard on what they are doing.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Students may be assigned projects from their instructors over summer break. This task can be rather frustrating, time consuming, and confusing when made by a teacher. Students have different lives with different perspectives from one another and their teacher. Students may even have a better understanding when a fellow student-peer explains rather than a teacher. Summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed.\n \n If students were to design a summer project, they'd think of the best way to relate to others and compromise to obtain the best connection with others. Students know that others think differently and go to various locations over break, however; it wouldn't exclude them from the assignment, but rather work toward their schedule as planned and give them a topic for a project. This would mean students don't have to consume lots of time researching, won't haveÂ trouble completing the assignment, and have fun on break with this student made project that reflects back on, \"Your Summer Vacation\", for example.\n \n Each students see things different from each other and teachers as well. Teachers can be one sided and assign things based off what they think is best for their students, furthermore; this may not be true because students don't think or see like teachers. Students have a huge variety of different perspective on things. So, a project created by students would fit better because of all the ideas sparked up would come together and be at everyone's benefit and not just one specific person. Teachers tend to confuse students with the way they word things at times, where as students have a better understanding of one another and all there different ideas they brainstorm as well. Also, students may have more in common rather than with their teachers because they're more likely influenced by the same stuff that's around their age group like things such as: music, television, social media, and/ or video games.\n \n Many different times there has been students who fail to complete projects assigned by their instructors because of how overwhelming the directions were or how hard it was to process. Students will want the best understanding for each other because we know what's difficult and what is moderate work. Teachers sometimes expect students to do things they can't do on a project; if a student were to design a project, it would get straight to the point and tell you exactly what you need to do in order to complete the task correctly and not wrong while being away from school during the summer. Students also understand that they may even would want to work in a group, especially if there away for break so they can help each otherÂ out possibly, but teachers only allow it to to be one person where it may be more challenging without the help of them being at school. Students on break don't want to have to spend their time working on stuff for school, that's why if students made a project, it would educate but not interfere with their freedom,so everybody wins, both teachers and students.\n \n Overall, students don't look toward to doing summer projects, they'd rather go places and have fun with friends and family. However; the task might as well be a fun, student-organized project that is planned to help gain knowledge during break. The results of this would be that students are still learning while they enjoy themselves and not stressing over not being able to understanding what there doing. With the addition of the help from their parents too, students would put in a format where anyone who reads the instructions, knows exactly what to do. Student-designed projects would be the best way for students to learn over summer.Â",

      "Throughout our school career's projects are often assigned to extend learning during the summer break. Summer projects are more often created by teachers. These projects are rather extensive due to the months that are given to complete it. Those who may opposeÂ state that it is the teachers job to create these summer assignments and they are able to bring more structureÂ to the project. Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true.\n \n Students creating their own summer projects can benefit them as students. Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed. After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next. Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students. Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work. Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project. Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again. Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass. Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions. If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year. Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them. Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning.\n \n Through creating their own assignments, students are able to build qualities that are helpful in a work environment. The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticismÂ can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that isÂ helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with schoolÂ assignments this skill can be applied to any work place.\n \n Summer projects can help extend learning outside of school during summer break. Through students creating their own summer project there is a better understanding of the project but also an excitement to complete it. Having created their project a sense of control over students learning can be gained which is often lost throughout the school year. Those who oppose may state that teachers should create summer projects because they have more experience than students and that teachers are able to introduce new topics to students. Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning.",

    Essay:
      "Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?\n \n During summer break some schools require teachers to give out summer projects to assure that students continue to learn while on vacation. Even though students may not enjoy getting it done, it gives the teacher feedback on how well you are learning in the summertime. These projects are either teacher-designed or student designed. While teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages, summer projects need to be student-designed so that it is less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster.\n \n When projects are teacher-designed, teachers will usually design them as more difficult to do so that it can give their students a challenge to do better. This technique is often done by teachers but what they do not realize is that when teachers design projects that are more challenging it is much harder on the student to understand, let alone get the project done. On the other hand, some students may be out of the country the whole summer so giving them teacher-designed projects that are challenging will give them a harder time for them to learn or get the assignment done.\n \n In the past I have had a very hard time getting most of my projects done because of lack of motivation and because of the way teachers design certain projects. If students are the ones to design it, it will increase the amount of students who do the project because they are the ones who are designing it. In addition making it much more easier for them to understand and get the project done. If summer projects are student-designed, students will not have to use the excuse of not getting the project done because they \"didn't understand it\", instead their will be no excuse because they are the ones who to designed it, not the teacher.\n \n Most students work a lot faster than others because of lack of understanding. Although teachers may not even realize it, they design these projects in ways in which students will often have a hard time with having at least some progress done because they simply do not know where to begin. When the student is the one who is able to design it, it allows them to have the opportunity to decide what to include and what not to, so that it makes their learning easier. In addition, having summer projects be student-designed allows them to work twice as faster than using teacher-designed projects because the student is the one that knows what they have to include.\n \n In conclusion teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages but all projects need to be student-designed because at the end of the day the student is the one who is learning. All projects should be student-designed for these reasons: less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster. Summer projects that are student-designed instead of teacher-designed ensures that the student is more likely to succeed. In addition teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages but all projects need to be student-designed because at the end of the day the student is the one who is learning. Â",

      "Schools across the country have been implementing a method that ensures that students continue learning during their break, this method is: Summer projects. Summer projects are usually teacher-designed and inconvenientÂ for a majority of students over the summer. There has been a great debate whether or not summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, I personally think they should be designed by students.\n \n Often times when students are assigned summer projects they are incapable of completing them due to vacations or other activities. Students should design summer projects because they know what they are capable of completing. Some students have jobs, sports, or volunteering, which do not give them ample time to compete their summer projects. In eighth grade, I was tasked with a summer assignment, but I couldn't complete it because half of the time I either did not have internet connection or I was too busy exploring new places. If I had designed my own summer project that year, I would have been able to complete it due to the fact that I know my own schedule and capabilities\n \n If summer projects are student-designed it would be more enjoyable for students. Students know what methods bore them and what methods do not; students can omit the methods that bore them and replace them with a more interactive methods. On the contrary, teachers are more experienced with creating projects, can ensure students are learning what is required, and know exactly what curriculumÂ should be in summer projects.\n \n Student-designed summer projects give students more incentive to complete them; they are more interactive and cater to students. Student-designed summer projects would be flexible and easier to comprehend for students. Ask yourself, would you want to plan your summer or let a project plan it for you?",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students should design these projects to let the teacher see how creative students can be. Also to show the diffrent ways students can use their mind to comlete the project in the course of the their break. In some cases students will not want to do any work over their break, but if these students can design the assignment and do what ever project they want to do they will be willing to do the work. Furthermore, students being able to design a project for the course of summer break will help students learn how to complete a task they assign themelves and will help students be able to set goals and accomplish them in the future.\n \n This form of learning can assist students in being creative and opening up the mind to new things. Those qualitys help expand the information you know and can benefit you in the long run. These things form a intellegent mind thats why I feel its a need to try and do new things to learn. For example, there was a time when I was told by a teacher to try a new method in reading that I come up with because she said thats something to make you remember what youve just learned ,and ever since then I have always been open to new things and ideas when it comes to coming up with a new way of learning. Therefore, I always try to incourage others to do the same because its something that strenghtings you, opens the mind, and makes you a smarter individual.\n \n Using your mind in diffrent ways stimulates students brains and Creates new pathways for information to be shared. This is a way to get a better understanding of ways you can look at certain situations as a student. For instance, you might not like the way things are going in class but if you were to sit and think of better ways to handle the problem it will show you that thinking in diffrent ways can make a problem a blessing you just have to be willing to put forth the effort. trying is better than not trying and that can make a big diffrence in your life and how you live it. It takes being diverse on how you think to become a great student.\n \n Students creating their own project for their summer break is one of the best things you can get a student to do because they have to think and use diffrent ideas to complete a assignment that they choose. Its important to understand the importance of this because it will give them something to do to remember what they learned from school in the past year while they are on summer break, so they can't forget any information that is needed for years to come. Also will be alot easier for them to accomplish things in the future due to working in the summer nights through school and this will highly benefit the students and their future. Thats the reason I think this will be beneficial to anyone who attempts.\n \n Another reason is that it will prepare the students for a heavy work load in years to come. For example, being in highschool and later going on to college is not just a walk in the park its hard days and long nights to accomplish something bigger. Students doing this at a young age will have them ready for the highschool and college lifestyle. Also will give them something they can never loose and thats the dicipline you get from doing obstacles like this because it keeps you from getting distracted and helps you focus harder on the project and they all starts with you aswell so its the dicipline you aquire from doing things like that.\n \n In conclusion, students are required to design their own project they are to complete over the course of summer and create it by themselves. I agree with this because it can give the students important qualities that they only can get from doing something like a self made project and can benefit them for their future. Doing certain things in life are only to help you learn and grow and doing a project like this will help you be able to multitask and do things a different way then you see everyone else doing. Therefore students designing their own projects can help and benefit them to be a better individuals in the future.

    Essay:
      "Studies have proven that schools that assign projects and assignments for their students to work on over the summer have seen a much higher success rate in the upcoming school year than if they didn't assign anything. To students, summer projects are not their ideal way to spend their summer and they often procrastinate until the end of the school year. Some projects may be really fun and interesting, but others may be thick packets of mindless busy work that can really take the fun out of summer vacation. Although teachers are around students all of the time, they still have some blind spots as to how they learn the best and what will encourage them to get their work done. If the summer projects that the students are assigned were to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed, there would be a much higher completion rate, less blame on the teacher for the project, and the projects would be better suited to match the students knowledge on the subject.\n \n To start, student-designed summer projects would lead to a higher completion rate. The students would feel more compelled to complete their projects knowing that they were the ones to design it. There's something different about doing something someone else made and is forcing you to do rather than something you took the time to make that you know you will understand when you work on it. For example, you work at a business with a group of people and you were all individually assigned to create a plan of how the company would take on a new project. After you all have presented your separate ideas you've worked really hard on, your boss chooses this other guy's plan over yours. For the next few months, you now have to work on his plan with him controlling everything are doing, which is miserable. If your plan was the one to be chosen, you would have a much better attitude towards working on this plan because you were the one to design it. This scenario works the same with students and teachers. Students don't like being given work during the time that they're supposed to not worry about school, especially when they have no control over the matter. This is the first reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n To add, if summer projects were student-designed, students would be a lot less upset at their teachers for giving them work over the summer. When they go to start working on their projects, they will know what to be expecting, so they won't be blindsided with difficult curriculum that they will spend hours trying to figure out while they are resenting their teachers for making them that stressed over the summer. If they are the ones to design it, they cannot blame their teachers for anything, and they most likely won't find a reason to blame anyone. It would definitely be a good idea to have the teachers set a general level of information they have to know for the upcoming school year so that they don't have the students designing their summer projects with information they already learned in previous years. This way, the teachers will be happy because the students are learning the information they want them to learn, and the students will also be happy because they had control over how they got to complete their work.\n \n Lastly, student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to design the curriculum given to them in a way that they can understand and complete the assignment to their best ability. Some teachers can tend to over estimate their students ability and knowledge of a subject, so only the students can truly know their own ability and know what will help them be able to understand the material the most. At the end of the day, the goal of the summer assignment is to keep students learning during their break and give them an introduction into what they will be learning about in their next school year. Allowing the students to design the projects will most likely achieve this goal better than if a teacher were to design it. For example, math is one of the subjects that students tend to struggle with the most, and giving them an assignment with material on it that they are unfamiliar with because it's something they will learn next school year is not beneficial, especially if they do not have a teacher with them to ask questions. If the student designs it, they will be able to take the topics given to them by their teachers and include links to websites such as Khan Academy to help themselves with it over the summer. Overall, students know what works best for them and they are the ones completing the work, so the least the school can do for them is allow them to design their own summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects are beneficial to students in their preparation for the upcoming school year; however, giving the students the opportunity to design their projects will lead to more success over the teacher-designed projects. Students being more likely to complete something they designed, taking away the blame students would normally put on teachers, and students knowing their own ability and knowledge are three out of the many reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Ultimately, it would be ideal for both students and teachers to work together on designing the projects so that the students know what the teacher is looking for and the teachers can understand what the students are able to do; however, the students should have more control of the projects because they are the ones completing the projects, and it is their future that is being affected.Â",

And the students would know more of what the others would like vs what teachers would think the students would like.

Students would be more understanding about it vs a teacher. Students would make the projects or schedulingÂ of the projects way more conventÂ for students. And the students would know when would be a right time to have projects depending on the other students. Sometimes students have reasons or excuses to not being capable of going or doing a project. Other students would accept it vs a teacher not accepting it.\n \n Then lastly, students would know how to make things easy or hard for other students because students would know the other students better. The students will mostly know other students strengths and weaknesses better than a teacher would. They would be more capable of relating to the others whether or not something would be easy or hard. And they would know whether or not something should be challenging or way more challenging. Its like the if the students think its capable of being done then the other students that the project is for should be capable of doing it or would want to do it.\n \n Others may say that schools that require students to complete summer projects should be teacher design due to the teachers having more experience with creating summer projects. The teachers would be more capable of actually making sure the projects happen. And would be more capable of having the students do something in the unfamilar. But there others that say summer projects should be student-design because students would know how to make the projects fun for other students, students would be more understanding when or not projects should be done, and students would know what and where the projects should be hard.Â",

    Essay:
      "A start to a new beginning. Last summer a group of friends and I, started a summer program. A program where kids can learn different things, different ways to do things, and of course have fun. We built things such as, wooden boats, wooden hats, and wooden cars. We showed them different ways to do project. For fun we took the kids swimming, hiking, and fishing. At the end my friends and I got great feedback from the kids and their parents. With my friends and I taking on such as big program like that, showed me that any child could do whatever they wanted to, if they put their mind to it. That is why I think it is a great idea for students to design; because, they could come up with fun things to do, could be able to show others what they are able to do without a teacher's help, and they would already know what people their age like to talk about and work on.\n \n First, most students have great imaginations. That can cause them to come up with great, fun, and differentÂ things to do. Such as using 3D objects, using liquids, and maybe even using things from nature. Those different things can really get someone attention.\n \n Second, there may be someone that is trying their best to show everyone what they can do. Designing a project can be great way to prove themselves. That way when they finish designing, they are able to show everyone. That student would be able to call themselves a great independent worker.\n \n Third, when students are let out for the summer; they do not want to do thing involving school work. Having a student design the project can make sure it is on something that would make them want to work on something related to school. It will be something different for the kids. They will be doing something instructive, as their summer goes by.\n \n In conclusion, student designed would be the best choice. Some people might say teacher design would be best but I disagree. I beg you to consider my opinion.Â",

      "School projects are required for students at certain schools to complete over the summer to prove that they are still learning over their break. The summer projects should be student designed, because they are not in school at the time. If the teachers want to assign a project to the students for a period that they are not enrolled in the school system, they can atleast throw the ball into the students court on where to take it from there. As long as the student sticks to the theme of the project. A project to show you're learning something like the one in this case, can be taken through many different routes.\n \n Summer is a school vacation. When most schools let out for the break, they don't hold the students accountable for any school work. Unless say you were participating in home school, which would be a different story. Although this school inparticular has a different prespective by wanting the reassurance that their students are not brain-washed throughout the next couple months off. Assigning a simple tasks to show your teacher that you have really learned something, is not bad when student-designed, as long as kept within appropriate boundaries. When you get assigned something, with the choice to choose where you go from there, you will result in a better outcome. Learning something that you are curious, or excited about will give you a whole different experience. When something intrests you, you gain motivation.\n \n If the teachers had chose to design a project for the students, it would most likley be a clique. Im thinking thick stacks of paper you have to read through, by following up questions and writting. There is already enough of that work in school. If that is what the school would be going for with the summer project, they might as well find a way to cancel summer out completely. Being a pupil myself I know that as soon as I walk out of those school doors, I'm free for the next couple months. If you throw a stack of paper work at me at that time, I'm most likley to hold off, or forget about it copletely. As for i had just got released from that type of routine. Throwing extreme school paperwork at me as soon as I get free from that, doesn't make the most sense. If thats the case, cancel out summer completely, because the tradition of summer is a school vacaction.\n \n Say you simply hand the students a one sheet of paper stating that they need to come back into the next school year, exhibiting that they learned something intresting or new over the summer, you will get better outcome. Once you release the kids from the school, especially for summer you are not going to get the same energy out of most of them. If they are not enrolled at the time, the bottom line is that they really do not owe you anything. Giving pupils that freedom, then throwing what they are getting away from right back at them is not the way to go with this. Doing that, a lot of kids will have no desire nor care at all to complete that task. Summer is about chill and good vibes. Throw something simple but effective at the students, then you tell me if you achieve a good outcome in return .",

    Essay:
      "Students after a long and rested summer break usually come back to school in August forgettingÂ what they learned the previous year. To assure that students continue to learn over their break they should be able to make their own project instead of having a teacher designed project.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed as it provides more creativity and freedom in their work, as well as it shows that they understand the given content by the teacher, but the project may not be easy to understand and complete compared to a teacher designed project.\n \n A student designed project over Summer break creates creativity in the students because they would have to break their boundaries in order to discover what they need to create in their project. Students will also have more freedom because they will be able to chose their topics based on their own interest. This allows students to be excited to learn during their summer break; for example, if they are allow to choose what their project will be based about they will be more productive and continue to learn more as they will have an interest in their work unlike a teacher designed project that students might disagree on and become less productive to a topic that creates noÂ satisfaction towards the students. That is terrible for the schools when students arrive back to school over break as they would not have learn as much because their topic was not interestingÂ and maybe some would choose not to complete the teacher designed project because of the topic.\n \n Allowing students to create their own project also visualizes that they understood their teacher content, by taking their teacher content and combining it to their own ideas into a project that shows the teacher that the students still remembers what they learn over summer break. While a teacher design project does not show if a student fully understand the content because every student will all have the same ideas and will be unable to show what new content they learned over the summer.\n \n Because student gets to work on their interests which may be different then what they learn in their school year, they wouldÂ have to do research to learn new topics that they never could have done with a teacher design project. A teacher project would not need to research new topics as they would just need to revise on what they learned over the school year. Thats why a student design project is better for learning for when they return back to school they would've had learned new content.\n \n A teacher designed project is the least choice for a summer project. Although, it does have its own benefits such as being less stressful on students to work on this project because they will already know the basics and what to do for the project. They would be able to work together helping student understand the content more; for example, they would look over each other work making sure that they understand that they are doing the project correctly. Teacher designed project allows student to refresh and review what they learned during the school year over Summer break, that a student design project will be unable to accomplish due to the fact that teacher designed project is mainly about what they already learn instead of expanding into new topics.\n \n In order to allow students to learn over their Summer break they would need student designed project to allow them to learn new things while also giving them more creativity that will help them out when they return to school. The student design allows for opportunity for the students to choose what they might want to do in the future and interest while a teacher design is not fully capable of doing the same. Allowing student designed project will help schools and student grow and learn while they are on break so that they don't come back to school forgetting main topics and having to waste time relearning such topics.",

Many may agrue that students should continue getting their education in the summer, but the summer time is when students get a break from school. Summer projects should be student designed because many students want to enjoy themselves and work full time jobs.\n \n During summer break many students choose to enjoy themselves. The entire time while on the break the project that needs to be completed will be on students minds. Students designing their summer projects can give them an opportunity to finish the task and enjoy themselve. In contrast, with teachers designing projects students are least likely to get completed during the break because of how uninterested they are.

Working and having to do a project can be alot, but some students can weigh things out and make it happen. Not everyone can multitask sometimes people's mind be set on one thing at a time.

      "Some schools often do have little summer programs going on for the kids like the elementary schoolkids and the middle school kids. The summer programs should be student designed just becuase its to help the students learn a little bit over their summer break to keep their brains going. They provide those for students who may need a little bit of help in school or t o just simply have fun. Sometimes, even highschool provides summer programs like rcps+ also or what people call summer school. They also have summer projects to make sure students are still learning over their summer break.\n \n First, since the summer programs and summer projects are technically for the students, it should be students designed. The students most likely wouldnt go to the school programs or the student projects if they are teacher designed just because the teachers designed them and they might not like how the teachers designed them and stop coming to the programs and the projects. If the students design them, then it can be educational and fun for all the the other students that participate in them. Not every student has the same interests, specially when it comes to their interst in fun. The students should make the programs and projects basedd on their versions or ideas of fun so they can keep coming and participate in them.\n \n Second, since they should be student based, students should get to pick and choose what happens during the day or during the class. Lots of students dont like to be all together in one room with alot of people they dont know either so they should be able to have they own classes with people they know during the programs just so they can be in a friendly enviornment, surrounded by people they know and possibly love and just all around be happy during the day. The programs should be like school with the boys and girls in classes together and not split up into rooms with just boys and rooms with just girls. They should also have a teacher that can teach them in fun ways that the students like so they can still be in a learning enviornment and still have fun while learning. The teacher would be the most important part about the programs and projects because if you have a bad teacher then it would be hard for the students to learn and pay attention because no student would want a bad teacher teaching them. They should have a good teacher who can help then learn, have fun doing it and provide a healthy and stable class full of fun and students ready to learn.\n \n Third, since the programs and projects are during the summer, the shouldn't take up the students whole summer. They should be for 4 weeks or 1 month just so the students can still have a month and some weeks left of their summer break to do what they want and stay up for how ever long they want and to go where ever they want to go for the remainder of their summer. The classes should be like regular classes also. The students should have to be at the programs by 8:45 and the programs should end by 1:45 just so the students can still have the rest of their day to goof off or relax. Since the programs and projects should be student-designed, they should be able to pick the programs they wanna take, the things they wanna do in the program or project, and should be able to pick the place the program or project takes place at. Not all students are going to want to be in the same place with others since its based off of student-design so they should pick their own place. Since it would be student-designed, the students who would be participating in the programs or the projects could gather together and form a game plan on how they want them to be like. They can agree on where they take place, the time of them, who are seperated into groups and what to do during them.\n \n In conclusion, Some schools often do have little summer programs going on for the kids like the elementary schoolkids and the middle school kids. The summer programs should be student designed just becuase its to help the students learn a little bit over their summer break to keep their brains going.

      "Letting teachers design the project is the most ignorant design ever. Most students would hate to do a teacher design project. The projects should definitely be student design. I strongly believe a summer project is an intelligent way of letting students retain the information. However it should be student design because they'd be more likely to do it, they'd understand the project more, and it gives them responsibility.\n \n Firstly, students would be more likely to participate in a student-designed project. A whole of of students won't be pleased doing a summer project, so the least schools could do is let the students design the project. Also some teachers make projects way too boring. So if the students design the project it'd probably be less boring for them. It'd be much better to let the students could be as creative as they want. When people find something boring they won't do it, especially young people. So letting the students design the project would increase the chances of the student passing the project.\n \n Secondly, the students would understand the project more. Some teachers make extremely confusing rubrics for the project. When teachers make confusing rubrics it causes a negative reaction to the students trying to complete the project. Some students would lose confidence in themselves on the project, which will increase their chances of failing. That would be a horrible startÂ to the new school year. The goal is for students to pass not fail, and teacher design projects would really increase failing chances. Students will have a hard time passing something they don't understand, because like I said earlier; some teachers make really confusing project-designs.\n \n Lastly, is it gives the students more responsibility. Responsibility is one of the most important things a young person can learn. It helps with maturity & being a better adult. So the student would be responsible for the project & designing it. I know it's very little responsibility, however it does help.\n \n Projects should definitely be student designed. Student design projects teaches students more responsibility. Also it would make students more likely to complete the project. If schools do make summer projects, I hope that they are student designed.Â",

      "Some schools implement a summer project to continue the flow of learning, and to ensure that the students' brains retain learned information. When asked to take a position on whether students or teachers should design these projects, I chose both sides. The reasoning behind my decision was quite simple: one side is more knowledgeable when it comes to the information, and has years of experience in teaching on their side. However, nobody knows the experience of living as the secondary group more than they themselves do, so it makes sense that they would have a part in this idea.\n \n Allow me to begin by playing devil's advocate against my own thinking. One may refute my statements with the simple argument of, \"Well, students don't know how to teach, so why should they have a part in this?\". One may also describe my thinking as 1 by stating along the lines of, \"Well, nobody knows how to plan exciting experiences better than the ones who have to endure them\". Now, both these arguments are well rooted and difficult to counter, however that in and of itself is what lends them to my cause. The first argument supports the idea that teachers are more experienced, thus more prepared to enact such ideas and projects; the second argument then supports my secondary belief, that the students better know themselves, and can lend more than a simple helping hand in the creation of such activities.\n \n Now that I have finished counter-arguing and rebutting, I can begin my statements. I would like to begin with the teachers. My standing on the subject is that teachers are more experienced and better suited to plan the informational aspects of a summer's project. Why, if a student knew the subject matter well enough to plan such an activity, and knew how to best teach and explain it, then they would be in no need of a project or a teacher! Yes, it is the job of the teacher to... well, teach, and it is the job of the student to learn. However, this does not exclude the student from the planning process all together.\n \n The student is quite important, because they are the target audience. They will know, better than anyone, how to reach out and grab hold of their demographic. The student knows what is fun, boring, enticing, and annoying to them as a whole. While it is true that not all students are made equal, and what is fun to one may be dull to another, a democratic poll can be issued to help even the playing field. Alternatively, multiple projects can be issued out to different types of student, or a simple skeleton plan may be issued, with which the students may piece together their own project. Perhaps all three can be issued as a choice, with students choosing which \"flavor\" of project they would find easiest to follow. Yes, the student is an important piece to project design, with the teacher serving a bigger part in project management. Let the demographic choose their product.\n \n As I finish, allow me to restate my core ideas. The teacher is an important utility in the informational and managerial parts of a summer project; however, the student plays just as important a role in the design and creationalÂ aspects. Both sides are nearly equal in importance, and choosing just one as the end all be all is not dissimilar to how American politics are carried out. Yes, it is important to have a fair balance of both sides, with each person playing to their specific strengths. Too much equality and you have a democracy that will never move forwards. Too much freedom and you have a form of communism in which there is no order to help guide everyone to the correct paths. Yes, a balance is much needed; a balance, mind you, that will never be truly found.\n \n That doesn't mean we shouldn't try, however.",

      "Would you want to waste your summer on useless information, or getting a head start on what you are going to learn next year? Teacher-designed summer projects usually prepare you for what you will be learning. So, why not take that chance and have a head start. Teachers make these assignments for the students benefit. It is always better to be prepared, than to be struggling. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed, because the teacher would relate it to what they are going to learn, they could give the students a challenge and choices, and their topics could be more relevant to society.\n \n Although, teacher-designed summer assignments could be more relevant, student-designed assignments would be more fun. The students know what they are interested in more than teachers do. Students could create and design summer assignments that they would enjoy. Doing something fun and entertaining to the students would make their summer not feel like a waste, even though it is for school. However, it may be more fun than if teachers made the assignment, but it would be a waste of time and effort. Students could make the assignment whatever they want and not have it benefit them in any way.\n \n Having a summer assignment about what you are going to learn could help you prepare for that class. Teachers know what their students will be learning, so they should make summer assignments related to that. The assignment would then prepare them for that class next year, and their summer would not have been a waste after all. This could help many students, because everyone learns at a different pace. Students who need more time than others to comprehend the information would be getting a head start. So, when they come into school, they will not be struggling or behind everyone else.\n \n Students could get a challenge or a choice to choose what they want, benefiting them and their interests. If students came up with the assignments, they could be too easy. Teachers know a students limit by their academic skills. If students had a challenge in the summer, it could be something they have never experienced before or thought about. Students would be learning and enjoying their summer at the same time.\n \n Summer assignments should be relevant to society and not useless information. Teachers are usually aware of what is going on in society, whether that is economically or politically. They could make a summer assignment about an issue in our society. If there was a summer assignment like that, there would be many online resources to help the students since it is a current topic. This would also benefit the students by enlightening them in the problems of their own society and community.\n \n In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher-designed to benefit the student. Not all summer assignments are boring. They might require you to read a book or do some research, but it would help you in the near future. Students who do summer assignments are less likely to be confused or behind in class, since they had a preview of what they were learning. Teacher-designed summer assignments benefit students by giving them a head start on what they are learning, the assignment could be a challenge or a choice, and the topics could relate to society making it more relevant.Â",

      "During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education.\n \n When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students.\n \n A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project.\n \n In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses.\n \n Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.",

      "During the school year, classroom instructions and lessons are prepared and taught by the teachers, so why wouldn't the summer assignments that keeps kids prepared for school, be made by teachers ? Summer assignments allow students the chance to stay ahead of their classwork and curriculum while they are away from school. These assignments help kids in many ways, whether it be to prepare for the SAT, ACT, or just a little head start for an advanced placement class. Teachers know the curriculum of their classes better than some principles, so it is only right that these assignments be prepared by the teachers themselves. Teachers need to be in charge with making their summer assignments because they may have specific ways they want their incoming students to learn, they have the most experience in the subject they teach, and students may be exposed to new styles of learning that could help them far beyond just school.\n \n Teacher-made summer assignments are great for preparing kids for the next chapter of school. With that being said, student-designed assignments would not be such a bad alternative. Students only grasp knowledge and lectures when they find interest in them. What better way on finding out how summer assignments can interest students, then to just let the students come up with the layout of the assignments themselves. Nobody can relate to students more then themselves. Some students are hands on learners while others are more visual learners, students could come up with multipleÂ assignment designs that meets the needs of physical and visual learners. Summer assignments that are made by teachers in one way may not help a physical learner but aid the visual learner, or vice versa and that would not be fair to either student.\n \n At all schools, teachers have a required curriculum they must teach to their students in a certain time period. Allowing the teachers to make the projects would greatly reduce the time spent in the classroom on going backwards in their curriculum to catch students up, and allow them to move forward faster. Many colleges around the world look at the scores of students SAT's and ACT's. These two test have a certain amount of curriculum that is covered through all years of learning. Unfortunately, many teachers do not have enough time to cover all the material on the two tests. Summer assignments give kids that extra needed practice and knowledge to do well on the tests.\n \n The SAT and ACT are not the only test students have to take while they are in school. Students also must take subject specific test and quizzezs for their individual teachers. Since, teachers are responsibleÂ for making their own test for the students, they may have a specific way they want their students to study or look over the material, summer projects are no different. Teachers are human, each one of them has a different method of teaching and testing. By allowing the teacher to design their summer project, it allows for kids to be ready for the methods their teacher uses to test and lecture. Not only could the methods of learning be new to the student, but they also could prefer their teacher's new ways more than what they used in the past.\n \n Summer Projects should be teacher made because they cover materials that students will need to use in the classroom and also show's the student kinda how the teacher likes to teach and deliver the curriculum in the classroom. Teachers go to college for 4 years just so they can teach people. They are the most qualified in helping any person succeed academically. If you are a parent, tell me honestly, would you trust your own child in coming up with their own school assignments ? Â Â Â Â  Â",

During the school year, students get to choose what classes do they want to take. After students select what classes they want to take for next year, they usually get summer assignments or summer projects to prepare them for the upcoming school year. In other states, summer projects or summer assignments are either teacher-designed or student-designed. I always preferred that summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning.\n \n Doing a project brings astonishing ideas to a student. When the teacher gives a simple task to do a project by using tri-fold display boards, construction paper, and color; it gives the student the freedom of what they want to create. Students grow a mindset of what will help them. Some students do well by being creative because some of themÂ are visual learners. Visual learners understand materials by looking at a specific picture to capture the concept, so it can be a part of their memory. When creative students start coloring; it gives them less stress. Less stress causes to work faster and gives relief, and it helps them to make a nice presentation. Creativity also brings the teachers attention when it's time to present. Teachers will see that these creative students took their time to make a neat artwork and helped them to understand their assignment by designing it themselves.\n \n Self-studying prevents the student to be behind. Self-studying can be hard at first, but once you understand how to do it and manage it; therefore, it becomes easier. Studying by yourselfÂ doesn't make youÂ re-read, highlight, and memorize the textbook the whole day. UseÂ different ways to study such as doing projects, making flashcards, or teaching it to a friend. Most of these self-study learners make detailed projects to make it enjoyable for them, and it can make them motivated. For example, you are taking an biology class in the fall. Your assignment says to make a project that makes you notice nature. You come up with a brilliant idea and make a bird feeder. You use creative ideas along the way such as making a bird feeder out of an old milk carton. After that, you put half of the seeds inside and the other half on the ground.Â To observe your data, you would see which type of birds came to your feeder, what time, and what day of the week. This shows that you noticed nature by motivation and self studying by making data.\n \n During the summer, students learn new material for their future classes. When learning about new knowledge during break, it makes students more engaged. Students don't have a deadline when they can study, so they take it easy by doing it step by step. Since some students get bored over the summer, they get curious to find new things. There are students who make their own projects to see how intelligent they are in that subject. By making projects, students have the will to discover their learning path. They have the time to go out to different museums or national parks for ideas for their project. They notice what they can establish in their future life by observing areas, so then they research more to make their summer project even better. The students designed their own projects by having the time to explore around themselves, making experiments, and taking risks. All of this helps them to engage their learning.\n \n In conclusion, projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning. Making summer projects that are student-designed helps learning grow and makes teachers proud of what their students can accomplish. Student-designed projects give no procrastination, spend more time with friends, and manages your time easily. This is why student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed projects. Â Â Â",

      "The idea of summer projects for students is a great way to assure that they are continuing to learn outside of school independently. This is true when the students have the freedom and responsibility to choose which subject they want to deepen their knowledge about. Although teachers have the ability to design specific projects that relate directly to the curriculum, students would find completing their projects more enjoyable if they had the freedom to research a topic that they experienced first hand, as well as displaying an opportunity to those who travel and may research different cultures.\n \n Schools that allow the students to design their summer projects may include a list of topics provided by teachers to assure all students remain on task with the curriculum as well as develop a passion for their topic. With a list of examples provided, students may get creative with ideas and become passionate about their work, which should be the most important goal schools attempt to get their student to achieve. With passion, students become motivated to continue studying even when it is summer break.\n \n Moreover, those fortunate enough to travel have endless possibilities when designing their projects: from the chemical makeup of jet planeÂ fuel to the traditionsÂ and customs of villages in third world countries, there is no limit. By being able to experience new cultures, examine pieces of art work, sight seeÂ great monuments, etc..., students may design extravagant projects that expose others to what they have experienced. When students present their project at the beginning of the following school year, those who did not get to travel may learn about topics they weren't able to experience themselves, making all students inclusive in eachothers summer activities.\n \n Although some may believe that teachers should design the student's projects, this should not be the case if schools wish for their students to learn to be responsible and independent. If teachers were to design the projects, yes, it would be guaranteed that it follows the curriculum, but there will be a clear lack of passion in the student's work. Forcing a topic students have no interest in or are unable to experience first hand will bring the students to resent learning during their break. And for those traveling, some may not have access to specific requests the teachers assign, forcing them to either return home to complete their project or to produce something mediocre. Students being able to design their own project that works best around their schedule would benefit everyone.\n \n Schools who allow students to design their own projects are giving the opportunity to be creative, independent, and responsible. With passion mixed in, possibilities for greatness are endless. Schools that have teachers design projects should reconisder and follow the schools that allow students' footsteps.",

      "Education is, without a doubt, a necessity in order to ensure a successful life- and it is the school's job to give the students exactly that. During the school year, they do so with classes and homework, but what about when school is already over? Many schools opt to let the students rest during these times, but some schools decide to take it up another step with summer projects. How the projects should be conducted, though, has been a matter of debate recently, and many are taking different positions and stances on the issues, largely divided into two different sides: teacher-directed and student-directed. The teacher-directed side believes that the teachers should take the lead and decide what they expect from the project, while the student-directed side believes that giving the students more freedom in what to do will allow them to learn more in the process. While it is easy to see how students would like a project designed by themselves, school projects should still be primarily designed and directed by the teachers.\n \n To start, teacher-designed projects allow for a more intuitive and in-depth project that students could not develop on their own. A human's brain does not develop fully adulthood; it is immature, and as such, leaves students prone to make decisions that may harm their own education. Furthermore, teachers have gone through rigorous training and have an intimate knowledge of their own subject, and thus can create projects that are on topic and beneficial to a student's education; on the other hand, students are only beginning to learn their subjects, and do not have the proper training or the knowledge required to create a project that allows them to learn.\n \n However, some may think that teacher-designed projects limit creativity and make the projects overall less enjoyable for the students. It is easy to think that way, but by limiting some creativity, teachers are actually ensuring proper education during the summer. If a student designed a project, for example, they could deliberately make the project simple, giving themselves an easy grade when, in reality, they learned nothing. To continue, the students could derail the project, straying away from what the teacher or school intended for them. All of these and more make the projects pointless and a waste of resources and time, but teacher-designed projects ensure that students stay on topic, while also raising the quality and benefits of the projects by requiring a bare minimum.\n \n Finally, teacher-designed projects allow for a standardized rubric that makes grading easier and simpler for teachers. Student-designed projects can be anything, especially since the teachers do not have control over them. Consequently, the teachers must adapt in response to the varied project types and qualities, making a rubric harder to define. This means that teachers require more time and effort to grade each project, making an already exhausting task even more arduous. However, a teacher-designed project is the same for every student, meaning everyone makes the same thing about the same topics. This lets the teachers focus on assessing more important skills and the quality of the project instead of checking solely completion.\n \n In short, a student-designed project simply cannot provide the in-depth education that a teacher-designed project gives. Summer break, while it is indeed a break, does not mean education ever stops. It is up to summer projects- and teachers, consequently- to keep it that way.",

      "Summer projects can be a helpful tool for both teachers and students to ensure that students will be ready for the next school year and not forget what they learned the previous year. Summer projects should be enriching, creative, and fun for students. While a student-designed project may be creative and fun, it would most likely lack the enrichment component which is the whole point of having summer projects. Ultimately, teachers know better than students how to prepare for the upcoming school year, which is why these summer projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Student-designed projects may sound like a good idea at first, but students would not be able to create a project that would prepare themselves well enough for the next year; at least not the same way teachers can. Students are already unmotivated to do any summer homework let alone projects. However, there is definitely an appeal to creating your own projects, which would help motivate students to complete and do a good job with the project. Most likely though, if students were given free reign to design their summer project themselves, they would take advantage of the opportunity and make a project that is too easy and in the end, unhelpful. This outcome would be even worse than just doing a teacher-designed project which would actually help students.\n \n Teachers know exactly how to prepare students for the next year, so although their project may be harder and not as fun, it would pay off in the long run and help students develop important skills they would need for the next year. Because the goal of summer projects is to make sure students are learning over break, teachers tend to focus too much on the content of the project and often do not make the project creative or fun. Often times, a teacher-designed summer project will be to read a book, analyze it, and write an essay about it. These types of projects are not fun for students, and the result would be a clear lack of effort from the student. I myself have experienced this, and know firsthand that students need to be interested in the project to ensure quality work. In order to avoid this and cater to students creativity, teachers should design multiple projects for students to choose from incorporating various skills such as art, writing, or research. This way, students have a choice and can pick whichever project they would have the most fun doing.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know what they are doing better than students, and can make summer projects fun for the student while also helping them continue learning for the next year. Teachers can always get feedback from students and implement new ideas on how to improve the same project to make it better for the next year, whereas students would not be able to do this. With having more experience and knowledge, it is best that the design of summer projects be left to the teachers.Â",

      "Summer projects created by students .\n \n Students should be able to design their own summer projects because they could use their prior knowledge and creativity. Knowing some of the knowledge will make the students dive deeper into the material and learn new things. Creativity allows students to think outside the box and explore beyond technology. Giving students the responsibility of choosing their own subject would make them interested into doing their project and enjoy making it.\n \n Students should do their projects based on what they are most familiar with. It would make it easier for them to do a project based on what they already know, so they would most likely start it immediately. They could also search through the web for new information. They benefit from it because they get to learn new material and are able to use it for the project. Although searching through the web is easy and fast, they could also visit places related to what their subject is about and collect new information from the place they visited. They can learn by being physically there and understand deeper by doing hands on work.\n \n Creativity allows them to think outside the box. Depending on the subject, they could experiment new things. They could use their mind freely and do whatever they would like to do. For example, teachers would be strict about what they would like the students to do and use but since you are free to be creative; you would be able to organize the information however you want it to be organized and how to introduce your project. Your project will be made up of your personality. If you want vibrant colors, dull colors, a variety of information, less information, pictures, or no pictures;it is all up to you. You get to express yourself with your project.\n \n In conclusion, if you let the students portray their projects in their own unique way. They will enjoy creating their project by using their creativity and prior knowledge. They will learn during their summer break and also be able to express themselves through a project.Â",

      "Certain schools make students complete a summer project to make sure students are still learning over their summer break. There is an ongoing debate over if teachers should design these projects or if students should. Some believe that the student should design the project because it is their summer break and it gives them time to be creative but this is not true. Teachers should design the summer project, not the students.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why teachers should design the project. Teachers purpose in this is to make sure the students project is educational and will benifit them in the long run. A teacher is a professional and will most likey pick a topic that will help them through the summer untill they get to school. Students might pick a topic or design their project on something that might not benefit them significantly educationally. Along with teacher design would come clear and formal instructions. Provided the teacher designs the project the instrustions should be crystal clear and students will be on the right path and most likely less confused than if they had to do it all themselves. Teacher design will aswell booost the project in looking more formal provided rubric can show expectations that need to be met. When teachers provide a project for their class, everyone has the same assignment, and it not only makes it easier for them but the students. This makes said project still formal but everyone can add their creative skills making it more personal giving it their own twist. With the same summer project and teachers permission, it would aswell be easier to work with others and share ideas. Teacher design benefits the students.\n \n There are further reasons on why teachers should be the ones designing students projects. Teachers know what will benefit the students, preparing them for their next year. Edcationally they will design a project based to fit their class and that will help their students. This is teachers being hard working and picking themselves what is best for their students. As stated previously everyone having the same project would benefit the teachers aswell. Multiple projects after a long summer is hard to grade but with everyone having the same assignment and rubric it would make it easier for the hard working teachers. The teacher deciding and designing how they would want their project would asvwell be a plus for them. They decide how they want it as well as theirs expectations, which makes it clearer for the student to unerstand as stated previously. Teachers designing the summer/schiool year projects benefit both students and teachers.\n \n The summer project should be designed by the teachers and not the students. There are many reasons why teachers should design it, for example it makes it easier for both the teachers and the students in the long run. those who disagree state that it would make it easier, more creative, and fun for the students but realistically this is not true. School work at anytime of the year should be designed and given by the school, this puts order in the school system.",

      "Schools should have summer projects be teacher-designed because teachers will pick projects that they know will be usefull to students, teachers put their full time and effort, and teachers will also make the project enjoyable to the students.\n \n Teachers have created many projects for many of their students, making them have a lot more credibility than students to construct a project. Teachers will know what information will be on the project makin it easier for them to construct projects that they know will be of use to students in the future. They all have insight on what a student should learn and what a student should not learn because they have been teaching all year long to students. They would take out all the useless information because they know how to filter it out, while students are learning themselves and will not know how to identify usefull information from useless making teachers more credible on the projects that would be assigned to students. Teachers can also make this project very clear and precise so that students will not get confused on what to do, how to research it, and how to write it professionally, unlike students who always go out of their way to make the project more lengthy and the basis of the project a lot more confusing to understand. Teacher know about the main ideas or concepts about these projects while students are unaware of these main ideas because they are yet to learn about it.\n \n So many teachers put so much time and effort into teaching their class everyday for an eight-month period, which makes it easier for them to create projects because they are so comfortable in this type of creative/learning environment. They put maximum effort to make all this information very precise and straight to the point while students usually, when it does not affect their grade, slack the work load by doing creating he project half-heartedly and not with their full time making the learning experience for the students researching the project also not as fulfilled to learn. When people make it seem like they put their full effort into teaching you about something, that sense or feeling that they invested a part of time into making your learning experience a lot more impactful, you are more compelled to study and learn about what they are teaching you and telling you to pracitce, which is what teacher do and are meant to do. Teachers will always have the time to give out and make projects because that is their job and they have to take it serious unlike students who either creating the project is not fulfilled to do their part or students just do not have the time of day to invest their time into projects. If students do take an investment of time to create these projects, they will not be able to focus on the other important things that they have to get done.\n \n Teachers also have a way of making learning a lot more fun and interactive on their daily teaching schedule, therefore, making them have a way to encapture a students attention into making these projects a lot more enthusiastic and enjoyable to research on. Teachers also make the projects a lot less objective based learning, teachers want to make sure that you understand the content to its fullest extent while also maintaining a curiousness towards the basis of the project, unlike students who make the project seem very boring, uninteresting, and very objective based learning which will make students to never research anything about that certain topic again because they could not learn anything fun about it or there was no interactiveness between the students and the project they were assignes to.\n \n In short, teachers have a better advantage and a lot more insight on how to design these projects because they know what information that will be of use to students, they put the maximum amount of time and effort, and they make the learning experience more enthusiastic and enjoyable to the students doing research on them. Teachers always seem to have the upper hand about how to pass off knowledge and wisdom because of these reasons.Â Â",

      "Grades are everything to students, even more so to students who want a bright future. Those students always turn in everything and always do thier work. Even those types of students get bored too. Students want something fun and interactive, and matbe they will actually enjoy school. Children, just like adults, don't want to do something they don't enjoy. The goverment actually requires kids to go to school and only miss 14 days of school each semester. Them making kids go to school takes the fun out of it. Then there are the teachers, some make school great and others not so much. Therefore, kids get themselves into trouble. They don't do it because they're bad kids, they do it because they're bored and wanna have fun. Then kids skip class, to hang out with their friends, or they just skip school all together. Some even get into fights, just beacuse they're bored and want to do something. Students don't like doing hoemwork, or class work, either. They like it least of all when they have to do it over summer break, but if we let them make up their own summer projects they are more likely to do it, have fun, and be creative.\n \n To begin, students don't want to do homework or projects, but if we give them a little trust and freedom to make their own project, they are way more likely do actually do they project. Kids don't like to be told what to do. The solution is to let them do what they want to, for their own projects. They come up with the concept and the idea, that makes sure that they are interested in it. A great example is, if you tell a teenager to make a project for science class, and they want to make a video game, let them. They can program a very low level game during the summer, and when school is back in session they can show they class and everyone can play it. Not only does this help that kid learn new skills and learn about science, but he can feel a sense of pride when people want to play his game. Some also say that playing video games can help them learn about certain classes. Just like, how minecraft can teach you a lot about earth science, a kid playing minecraft and trying to find ways to fix bugs with in the game, can help him learn skills for his programming class. Students are more likely to do a summer project, if they can create it themselves.\n \n Secondly, children need to be creative. This day and age creativity is even more important then it ever has been before. For them to be successful, they need to be different and think differently than others. They have to stand out from the crowd. Letting students make their own summer projects can help them do just that. Letting kids create something, not only benefits them now with a better grade, but benefits them later in life too. They learn that nothing that you love doing will be easy to achieve. That you have to really work at it, no matter how small it may seem. Students will most likely create something they love and can do it themselves. An example is, a student loves to bake and her english teacher told her class that they had to make a project on the book they just read, Romeo and Juliet. This student decides she is going to make the balcony sence, where the two characters are just talking. That student did something, she really didn't want to do, and turned it into something fun. That girl got to do soemthing she really loved and challenged her self to make soemthing so big. Children need creativity, so why not let them do their own summer projects?\n \n Last, but not least, kids need to have fun. They aren't going to do something that isn't fun. Kids aren't goin gto do something they can't pick. Thats like your parents forcing you into dance and you really hate dancing, but really love writting. Your not going to want to go to dance, you going to try everything to get out of it. Having fun is apart of life and if you never have fun, how are you suppose to enjoy life? People have fun in different ways, every person gives fun a different meaning. One kid might think partying is fun and another might think playing sports is fun. The point is, to enjoy not only a school project, but life, you need to have fun. If we let the students pick their own summer project, than they will have a much better time doing it. Isn't that whats most important? For everyone to have fun and not push it off, or just not do it. A good example of this is, a swimmer, a person who loves to swim competitively, does a science project on the human body. The project is on how the depth of the pool can effect your sleeping habbits. The student is going to have much more fun doing that instead of some stuffy, old project her teacher gave her. Students need to be able to have fun, letting them choose their own summer projects guarintee that.\n \n On the other hand, everyone choosing thier own projects, will make it harder on the teachers, to grade. They have not thought about, the students. Making it easier on themselves, doesn't make it better for their students. Teachers giving everyone the same projects doesn't make it fun or interesting. It makes it harder, because you want yours to be different, but the chances of that are really small. Then when they get back from break, they don't get that sense of pride and they can feel poorly aboout themselves. Teachers must let students make their own projects, not only does it help them have fun, be creative, and actually do the project, but it also helps them figure things out on their own with no help. That skill has to be taught somehow, why not through a summer project?\n \n In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects. This not only helps them now, with a grade, but it also helps them in the future, with very important skills. Teachers are going to have a harder time to grade these projects, but isn't it worth it? Teachers are here to teach students to be ready for life. Students don't like homework, but they would if they want to, having fun, and being creative.",

Summer projects should be teacher-designed projects due to the fact that teachers know what the students need to learn in the next grade. For an example, in first grade you learn how to add and subtract using double digit number, if the teachers designs the project for the summer you will have more knowledge about adding and subtracting. Also, teachers know the material to help you succeed in school. Not to mention that if the student designs it how would students gain knowledge of it?

      "Most students look forward to the last few days of school, those last few moments when the bell is about to ring and they can all go and hang out, or just go home and relax. After a whole school year's worth of work they are ready to take a nice break. But then those hopes are ultimately hurt a little when a teacher announces that the students are to complete projects over the summer. These projects should be student designed because of the work being assigned over vacation, giving the students a chance to self-govern themselves, and because they will have extra free time to work with.\n \n Some teachers would agree that if the students were to assign themselves projects, nothing would get done, or the students would not learn anything new. This really should not matter in the long term as the teachers already have enough control during the school year, and the students really should be allowed a break from all this learning. If the students do not get the break they might need, than what is the point of a vacation?\n \n Speaking of that vacation, students need that time to relax and unwind, preparing themselves for the next year. Some parents might even have big vacation plans over the summer to take their families interesting places. This means that a student will have to work his or her summer homework around the vacation time, which, in some cases, can be really challenging. One student might have a big project to get done, but their parents announce that they are taking a family vacation to Germany for a couple of weeks. Of course, this might not seem like a lot of time, when school stops, that does not mean everything else does as well. These students might have jobs to keep up with or other responsibilities outside of school, these projects just make things even harder than they need to be. When you give students a larger window to finish something, they get the chance to improve their leadership skills, either in a group, or with themselves.\n \n Students who design their own projects will get the chance to self-govern themselves, meaning they have more time to make creative decisions that can improve the project, rather than just having a week or so to finish it where they might rush it, or cannot dedicate enough time outside of school to get it done in time, lowering the overall quality. When students get to make these creative decisions, they can make the students think in new ways and bring out more interesting decisions to make the projects stand out a little more. All of this culminates in the extra free time the students have to think, execute, and produce a well-made product.\n \n The extra free time gives students more freedom to try more ambitious projects without the pressure of all the work that needs to be done within a week. The project will be able to develop naturally over time. If teachers assign these projects, then either the student will feel less compelled to do it, or it will not turn out as well because the student might not want to do that type of project in the first place. This extra free time is a great source for creativity and good student led projects because the students will be more compelled to do the work right, rather than just get through it so they can actually enjoy their break.\n \n Overall, these students would really feel bummed if they were required to do extra work over the summer for seemingly no reason at all, other than to continue learning. With student-designed projects, students will still get to enjoy their vacation, while learning more about self-governing, and making good use of their extra free time. Going to school is not something that everyone in the world enjoys, but is required, so if the teachers are really going to strip away some of the student's free time, at least let the students be in control. If you give the children more freedom, the creative results may be beyond anything you have ever seen.",

      "Summer school projects should be student lead because they allow students to keep their brain fresh, achieve a goal, and understand new concepts. School projects over the summer should be student designed. This allows students to keep their brain active, have a goal to accomplish, and learn new things. Projects to complete over the summer are a good tool for schools to use to keep their students ready.\n \n Some students might think a project for school over the summer is tyranny, however, keeping your brain thinking is very important. An interesting project, that should be mainly student-designed so completion is high, is a good brain helper. A benefit of the project will be once the students go back to school, it'll be easier to jump back into familiar topics because your brain has had a refresher recently. Freshman year of high schoolÂ I had an English project over the summer on Mythology which greatly helped me when I returned to school and Mythological stories was our first unit. Overall, keeping your brain up-to-date is an excellent way to be confident in your schooling career.\n \n During summer break a lot of kids end up being bored at home just watching TV or playing video games. A project, designed by students so the kids can stay engaged and interested, could shake this monotony and give the student a goal to accomplish. Goals are important and they lead to the person feeling good about themselves once they complete said goal. On the other hand, a student might say how they don't need a goal to stay active during the summer but they can always benefit from something to hold them accountable so just in case the student starts heading on a downward trend, the goal can lift them up and set them back on track.\n \n Learning new things is an important task to do often. Having a student lead project is a great strategy to allow kids to find and learn new things, explore new concepts, and complete tasks efficiently. Kids learning new things over the summer with a rigorous yet interest-grabbing project is an excellent way to expand the classroom horizon once school is back in session. It allows the teacher to make new teaching decisions such as what projects will look like in the future, what kind of strategies to teach with, and if said teacher can branch off into side topics that they usually couldn't branch off into.\n \n In conclusion, school-assigned projects should be student-designed so interest and completion is high, goals are made and completed, and the students' brain is kept in top shape. The ability a kid has to learn by themselves over the summer should be tapped into by schools more often. Projects to complete over the summer are a perfect tool to keep kids fresh and ready for when school starts back up.",

      "Which would they rather do? A project that is chosen by them and their peers or the teacher? Students are constantly given assignmentsÂ of which they have chosen and yet, some still never take the addictiveÂ to do the work to help them succeed. If they were to have student-designed some would not even attempt to do the project. Students should have a teacher-designed project because it would encourage them, there would be guidelines and less stress on choosing a topic.\n \n Firstly, some people doÂ not that have the motivation to do a projects and they need something to help keep them on track and push them to do it. Some students have a problem withÂ procrastination when it comes to big assessments such as projects, an essay, or even a simple PowerPoint. For example, they have a 600 word essay due in 2 weeks and its worth 30% of their grade. They will wait 2 days before it is due to finally take time and do it. If a teacher were to have something they have to work toward that they would really want to would drive them to do their best.\n \n Secondly, when there are guidelines to a project it gives that sense of urgency. A project or any assignment should be done without some source of instruction or direction on what to do. For example, if they were given an assignment and just told to do it would come out extremely unorganized. Teachers being in charge of a summer project is much better than students handling it because they have deadlines for each part of the project\n \n However some students want to do a project on something they chose and feel as though they need help with. For example, there is a student who has aced every single lesson that the teacher has taught but, the last lesson that they learned they really had a hard time on understanding it and its time for the projects the be assigned. They were assigned something that they knew with their eyes closed. Although, that may be true having a teacher-designed project is a lot easier because all they would have to is do the work instead of stressing about what they can do their project on.\n \n In conclusion, when an assignedÂ is monitored by a teacher it is more likely to go smoother than leaving the responsible to get their work done up to them to decide. It is preferred and it would be better for everyone if the teachers gave theÂ topic to prevent anybody have the same one,anybody not knowing what to do, and it help motivate them.",

    essay:
      "Schools now are requiring their students to complete summer projects to assure they are learning and maintaining the knowledge gained in the past school year. Though there has been some contemplation as to whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Students should design their projects because it will be in their skill set and the students will be more likely to complete it because it will be in their field of interest. However, there should also be some restriction as well. Students should only get to design their project if the teacher approves of it before hand.\n \n Every student has their own interests and things they like to do, whether it be in or out of school. With projects being in their particular field of interest, they will be more inclined to learn about the topic and complete a project on it. Kids who are more interested in animals and nature might not be as interested in a project about space or robotics, therefore not being as excited to do it and there is even a possibility of them getting a bad grade. From experience in a previous project I completed on manatees, I was interested and wanted to research the topic I chose. Projects that fit best to my interests where more fun and enjoyable, and allowed me to complete it on time while having lots of information on the topic at hand. These projects are also being completed during summer, a time when students are enjoying their long break. A project that is fun and to their liking will help the student get it done quicker and better. Students interests are sometime lost in the teachers decision, therefore they should acknowledge that students all arent the same and allow their students to design whatever project seems the most eye-catching to them. In the end, it makes a more excited and focused student.\n \n Along with students having different interests, they also have different skill sets as well. There is a wide range of courses and topics that each and every student does well with while others find more challenging. For example, a student could have a hard time in a math class while another thrives. Being a student myself, knowing that I would have to complete a project that i'm not as familiar and skilled at would stress me out to the point of not completing it. During summer most students use that time to relax from all their hard work during the school yearÂ and by adding on a project which doesn't align with their skills will cause them to feel panicked and overwhelmed to get it finished on time and have all the key elements. Projects should showcase what a student knows to their class, teachers, and sometimes family, but when given a topic that is far more challenging, they are less likely to complete it to the best of their abilities.\n \n One reason why there is controversy on whether the summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed is because the learning aspect of the project could be lost. Students will design projects that will not be connected to the curriculum or non-educational, therefore not allowing the student to learn as much. However, there are ways to avoid this problem. One way is to get the teachers to approve of the given project. In their decision they will hold true to the students interests and skills and help guide the student to design a more 2 project if needed. This will decrease the amount of non-educational projects that some students might come up with and also include the students main interests and better skills, which is often lost in a teacher-designed project.\n \n The requirement of summer projects has much controversy on whether the students should chose their project themselves or the teachers. With the students being able to do so, their certain interests will be included and their skills will be showcased. However, there would be an issue of students picking projects that won't be as educational as the school intended for them to be. To avoid this problem, teachers would approve of the given project, lowering the amount of non-educational projects while also having the student be excited and focused to do the project. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed, but only if the teacher approves of it.",

      "Summer projects is an excellent way for students to continue learning and to grow academically during breaks while having fun doing it. When teachers assign projects which is designed by them, it decreases the student's motivation to complete the project because students find it amusing to design and create their own projects and not the other way around. Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to research many topics which they could potentially be interested in. Summer projects during the break should be student-designed because it increases student motivation to complete the project, students are able to gain knowledge on something they came up with themselves, and they are able to have fun while conducting research on their own topics.\n \n The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because of the increase in motivation. Students are motivated when they are interested in what the project is about. When the project is teacher-designed, student's lack the motivation to complete the task as they could be uninterested in the project the teacher had assigned them. Some students might assume the project will be tedious because the teacher is assigning it and as a result, feel unmotivated. For example, When the teacher assigns a project, it can be difficult to research and come up with ideas which leads to the students feeling stressed and confused on what to do regarding the project. But when a student designs their own projects, they probably already have an idea or information on the topic of their project. Another example is when students are assigned a project, and there is a choice to organzie and create your own project for extra credit, students are motivated to perorm well on the project. That is why schools should have students perform research on their own project topic because it motivates them to get it nicely done. An increase in motivation means an increase in the quality of the project and the thought of satisfaction while completing it\n \n The second reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to gain a tremendous amount of knowledge as they are coming up with their own ideas on researching, creating, and completing their own projects. For example, during the break, multiple students travel out of state or out of the country. When the students go on vacation, they will locate lots of great topics and ideas to research on. Therefore, increasing the student's knowledge on the topic or idea of the project. This causes the students to become more erudite during the break and when they return back to school from the break. Although the students will still gain knowledge on a teacher-designed project, they do not gain a much broader view on the topic of the project. Another example is when a student works at someplace he or she enjoys working at and decides to do their project on that particular job. This is going to increase the sudent's knowledge as the student is researching more information about the job whilst also learning more about the place he or she works at.\n \n The third reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to have fun while conducting a research on their topic. Students always want something fun to do; therefore, by designing their own projects, they are able to make it as fun as they want. When the teacher designs the project, the students would probably assume that it is dull. For example, when a student does something for fun over the break, they could do their project on what they did instead of doing a project on something they have never done before. Another example is when a teacher-designed project is assigned and the teacher is extremely facetious about what and what not to include in the project. When this happens, the students won't find the project to be amusing or interesting.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed as it greatly benefits the students in many ways such as motivating them, allowing them to gain more knowledge, and having fun whilst working on the project. When teachers design projects for their students, they are not allowing the students to fully expand into many areas but allowing them to conduct a research and work on their project in a way they want it to be done, which limits the students ability to be motivated to work on the project, to gain knowledge on the project, and to enjoy working on the project.",

      "In some schools, projects are given to students to be completed over summer break. The reason a vigarious assignment is given is to assure students will be continuously learning over the summer when schools are temporarily closed. However, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Teacher-designed projects should be required for all students. Why should teacher-designed projects be a requirement instead of student-designed projects? Teacher-designed projects expand learning and the teacher is aware of what the students will be learning.\n \n To begin, teachers will be aware that all students are obtaining the same information. For example, a project was given by a teacher specifically on the topic saving and investing in today's economy. The teacher knows that all students will be researching and learning the concepts of saving and investing today. All students gained identical information and knowledge on one specific topic. On the other hand, if projects were student-designed there will be little unity of knowledge amongst students who are of equal age and grade classification.\n \n To continue, teacher-designed projects will expand the knowledge of students. If projects were student-designed they would more likely focus on a topic they already have prior knowledge about rather than stepping outside of their comfort zone. Teacher-designed projects tend to include circulum that students need to know that will help them grow academically. For instance, a group of girls in a high schoolÂ class were given a black history project. They did their project on Misty Copeland, an African-American ballet dancer, who they had previously researched before. They had information instilled into their minds and had already known about her accomplishments and struggles. They did not learn anything about her, because they had done projects before. With that being said, students will not willingly learn anything new if they designed their on projects. Teacher-designed projects would have a more positive impact, because it is being given by a teacher who can academically prepare students for the next school year.\n \n Last but not least, teacher-designed projects enforce specific directions and learning criteria. The projects will less likely be done incorrectly. Directions and criteria is specific, so it will not be off topic and the students will not be learning unnecessary information that will not help them. Teacher-designed projects are more focused on criteria that students need to know.\n \n Conversely, student-designed projects can be more engaging for students who like to be creative, or do things in their own manner. The options are limitless and researching what a student wants to learn will inspire them to obtain more knowledge to share with their peers. Students will be more interested in a project they can create themselves and that leads to results such as less cheating. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects should be required, because some students will focus on what they already know rather than willingly learning something new. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly.\n \n In conclusion, teacher-designed projects will not limit students to what they already know, but will help them grow academically. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly,Â because the teacher specifies instructions and limits the topics for their projects. Students will flourish more when projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed. Schools should require summer projects that are teacher-designed.Â",

      "Many schools currently assign projects over the summer to ensure students are still learning over break. There is an ongoing debate on whether said projects should be designed by teachers or students. Some say summer projects should be teacher-designed;Â otherwise, students wont use their full potential, will procrastinate, and won't learn anything of substance, but this is not true. Summer projects designed by students would more efficient than ones designed by teachers.\n \n There are various reasons why student-designed are better at promoting learning during Summer. Students will have more choices of what they can learn about instead of being restricted to what a teacher assigns them for that class. This means students can research subjects ,outside of the curriculum,Â that they may be interested in for their project. Learning about what interests them will motivate students to work harder on their task. Students will want to put more into their project in because it's personal to them, unlike projects designed by teachers. In addition, students won't feel like their time is being wasted on something they see no benefit in. Teacher-designed projects such as research papers, posters, and presentations can be mundane and seem utterly pointless. Students will want to prioritize jobs, relaxation and their social life over a project that they don't have any interest in.\n \n There are additional reasons as to why summer projects should be designed by students. Students will have to complete the project they made on their own free time. This will prepare them for the future, where they have to be responsible enough to set up and accomplish goals independently, without anyone demanding them to. Teachers often make projects that require students to reach very high standards. Failing to meet these standards usually results in failure of the project, which can be stressful. Student-designed projects allow students to reach their own standards, which can make Summer break less stressful. Finally, student-designed summer projects give students something to look forward to. They can be productive and learn without feeling like their summer vacation is being intruded by school work.\n \n Projects assigned during summer break would be more beneficial when designed by students rather than teachers. This is because it causes less stress, makes the students responsible for their work, and motivates them. Those who are opposed to this state teacher-designed projects encourage critical thinking, and learning during Summer, but this is not the case. It is important to let students learn for themselves so they can prepare for the future.",

    essay:
      'Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their break. The most simple thing to do, is to have the teachers design the projects, but why not let the students think for themselves. My take on this, is that students should have to put a little effort in, for once. Summer projects should be student-designed because they deserve some freedom, can show off their intelligence, and will help them develop life skills.\n \n Some may say teachers are more educated and have more experience; That might be true, but how are the students supposed to get a real experience if they never get to design their own project. My friends like when a teacher gives the class a project that is already planned out. The reason they enjoy this is because they are lazy and do not have to do any work. Teachers know a lot of information which should be passed on to their students. Although, that statement is true, when do the students get to pass their information to the teacher?\n \n Student-designed projects give the kids freedom in what they choose to do. At my old school, the students would have to read one book in the summer and then write a report on it. All my classmates would be so happy because they had the choice to read whatever they wanted. A teacher once told me, "freedom is a gift; We do not get that gift often and it is a mistake." This means, students are rarely given any freedom and all that does is limit them.\n \n Student-designed projects would help teachers see how intelligent their students are. In\n \n Kung Fu Panda , Master Shifu learns from watching Po move around the kitchen, that he has plenty of skill. In that scene, the master learns how much potential the student has by watching him do his own thing. In middle school, we would do our summer projects based on any news topic we read. This allowed the teachers to not only get an idea of who the students are, but also show them a baseline of how smart they are, as well.\n \n The projects that students self-design will help them develop life skills. A student creating a project on their own teaches them responsibility and problem solving. The student will have to find a solution to their topic, which shows responsibility by being able to complete this task well enough, to receive a good grade. My father believes summer projects he had to create on his own assisted him to where he is today. My dad thinks this because it showed him time management, which is a life skill students will need forever.\n \n Summer projects are meant to help students continue to learn over a long break. Although, why not make summer projects have more value? Instead, schools can help the students do more than just learn over break. Summer projects should be student-designed because they should have choice, will show off their intellect, and assists them in developing life skills. The school systems need to work together, to take action on making student-designed projects a priority, for getting students the best education.Â',

      "Should summer projects be Teacher-designed, or Student-designed? I believe that summer projects should be mainly Student-designed, with teacher approval. I believe this because of my own personal experiences. Students that I've seen who receive summer projects are not very interested, if ever interested, in the project assignments they receive. A way to get them more engaged is to have them pick a topic they would be interested in. As long as it pertains to the class of course, this is where teacher approval would take place.\n \n I believe summer projects should be Student-designed. One of the reasons I believe this is because I've seen students struggle with assignments they don't like, so much so, it can come to a point where they either give up,Â or don't even attempt it. My second reason is because it adds a level of involvement from the student, that ensures they're aware of how the assignment is to be done, as well as, their own personal spin on what their project is going to be.\n \n Summer projects should be Student-designed because prompts given by teachers can be quite boring, causing a lack of drive to finish the project, let alone attempt it. Some kids partake in summer jobs, or leave for vacation. The situation concerning the varying student should be reflected in their summer projects as being individualized. What I mean for this is, a student who is busy all the time doesn't always have the time to do a project. Even if they enjoy the content. The form of their project should also vary due to their location. Weather they're traveling all the time, and can only complete the project on an airplane, or maybe they live in an environment without constantÂ Wifi. Giving the student the opportunity to form their own assignment can add a level of enjoyment, to an already chaotic lifestyle thatÂ any student could be living with. Rather the alternative. A standardized project that only 65% of students are likely to turn in.\n \n My Second reason is the level of involvement shown by a student who gets to choose their own topic. Not only will they be more involved, and in sync with what they need to accomplish, they will be able to complete it faster, if not better than they would without their own involvement. Showing this type of involvement can help the student have a better understanding on what their end goal is, and how they can accomplish it, resulting in better work. As well as readiness in the classroom when they come back from summer break. Seeing as how the students don't receive teacher guidance over the summer, if they have a full understanding on their own project, it can result to having a better understanding for the transition into the next year.\n \n Someone who would disagree with my statements would believe that Teacher-designed summer projects are much better for the student. Some reasons for this would be, an extra workload on the student, or possible inappropriate content chosen by the student. In a students life there can be little free time, as life is different for eachÂ student, and adding on the creation of their own project, just adds onto the workload for both teachers and students.\n \n In conclusion I believe that summer projects should be student oriented. A student can show more interest in a personalized project. Secondly a student can gain a better comprehension on what theyre trying to learn from their own project that they enjoy. While some would say that it's an extra burden on teachers to add individualized projects, I believe that the American education system needs to be less standardized. and more individual. We all learn differently, and not every method of teaching is helpful t'words a students education.",

      "As summer starts to roll around, students usually start taking their school work less and less seriously. WhenÂ students are in control of what they are doing, or working on, they are more likely to complete what they started. When a student gets assigned to complete something its harder for them to finish, or to start at all.\n \n These summer projects should be student-designed because students tend to do better when they enjoy what they are working on. When teachers assign work for students to complete, they design it in a more complex manner rather than taking a simpler approach. Many students have more ideas which interest them, that the teachers might not consider, or think of when designing these projects. When teachers design these projects they lead to no benefits on either side. Students should be able to use their imagination and creativity while being on summer break as wellÂ as their knowledge.\n \n Students are always limited when it comes to teacher-designed projects. Such as when a student is assigned something that does not pertain to their life or the real world. This always leads to inactivity or procrastination which then leads to no work being done at all. This also almost never interests the student which makes the work harder, and less easy to focus on. Over the course of a month or two, people in general tend to get bored of things quickly, so it is always good to be working on something that interests them, or that they enjoy.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can also be a good thing as it can guide a student on where to start. It can also give them ideas on what to do, but it is also a gateway for them to not get as good of a grade as they could have gotten if they used their full potential. For example, when a student gets assigned to write a persuasive essay, they would most likely not incorporate any of their own ideas, but rather things they read from other sources. If the student wrote an auto biography on themselves that would spark their interest because it pertains to their own life. They would not have to go out of their way to use sources on something they do not care for.\n \n All in all students should be in control of what they are working on in their own free time, a time especially like summer. When something like a summer assignment is assigned to a student they should automatically have the right to design their own project. They should be able to base their work off their own ideas. When a student is designing their own project they have the best way of knowing exactly what they are doing, which will lead to better results. Lastly they should not have to worry about meeting someones' expectations but their standards,so them designing their own project will lead to less stress as well.",

      "Lots of kids love having summer break off from school, but when it comes to summer assignments there's only so much time in the summer for students to fit all their prior plans in with all the over-the-summer school work their teachers assign. And majority of students would also rather not do school work on their break from school and would just want to enjoy the time off but many schools require students to do some sort of school work over the summer to keep their brains active and to help them continue to learn. Some students have take part in saying that they would like to design their own summer projects for many different reason. In contrast, some teachers don't agree with the students for the summer projects to be student-designed. The required summer assignments should be teacher-designed by the students upcoming teacher so that the students can be prepared fully on what they are going to learn for the upcoming school year, so that the their teachers can make sure they include work from last year so they don't forget about the stuff they previously learned about, andÂ because teachers will most likely organize the work to be an appropriate amount since they're use to giving school work with projects and due dates but also understand that there are students that go on vacations and won't have the whole summer to complete an assignment.\n \n Teachers will know exactly how to format these projects and/or school work in correct ways to make their students stay activeÂ in learning and thinking to be prepared for the upcoming school year since they obviously will be teaching it for the rest of the school year. Since the projects and/or school work will be teacher-designed, their teachers can make sure it's relating to things they will eventually go more in depth with but be put into summer assignments to give some challenge or hints to students for what they're gonna go into more throughout the school year. The summer assignment from their upcoming teachers can also give the student an understanding of how the teachers teaching style is. And the expectations the teacher has since the work is given directly to the student by the teacher themselves.\n \n Teachers can also make sure to include in their summer project some previously learned information on their summer assignments to not only see if they remember and fully learned that particular concept, but to also see where as a student they stand and if they need more help or attention with that topic. It can help a teacher get to know a student better by seeing where they stand as a student after the work they did in their previous classes/grade. Also, putting in some challenging work from the previous grade can also tell the students that the particular topic or concept could be something their upcoming teacher thinks is very important to fully understand in order to move forward, or just to understand in general. It can give the student an idea of how their teacher thinks and will be doing things from now on.\n \n Since teachers became teachers by going to graduate school and some having other degrees included for their job, they usually have a good, if not, great understanding of good teaching skills and tactics and work format styles from their own past professors and previous teaching experiences. If they have a lot experience, it could help them gain knowledge over the time being on what worked well for them as a teacher and their students versus what didn't work. The teachers could have also been exposed to many different teaching styles and found one they believe is easiest to understand and/or thinks is easiest or their level of students to understand. Teachers can know ways to make sure projects or assignments could be organized good while also not entirelyÂ taking up a whole students summer with school work. They can organize it so it's spread out or split up into parts at a time so they don't put much pressure on the student who could feel overwhelmed by all the work they have to complete in a short amount of time. Especially if the student waits until the last minute to complete their summer assignment because they thought the assignment was really long and time consuming.\n \n Going back to how some students could think that they could make an assignment just as equally as efficient themselves just as teachers would, teacher-designed projects would be more efficient regardless since it could be more helpful to teacher because it could be based on exactly what the teacher wants to know about what the student knows to help them succeed for the rest of the school year. And most summer assignments are different depending on the class too. If a student is going into a class they've never taken before, how could they make up a student-designed summer assignment to help them when their teacher could just give them a direct summer assignment as a jump startÂ for the school year. Teacher-designed jump-startÂ summer assignments are just lessÂ problematic, more reliable, and reasonable for everyone overall. Â",

      "Summer break is the most anticipated time of year for students and teachers because it is a grace period that allows for relaxation and refreshment,of one's soul. The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back. The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits. Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits. Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around. To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher.\n \n The ability for students to choose their own summer projects would enhance their outlook on education,because they would study topics that interest them,and not teacher selected topics that would seem like a task. It is a scientifically proven fact that students retain knowledge that speaks to their own curiositiesÂ and that holds the most relevance to them. During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things. For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family. While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history. My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha. I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them. But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher. My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country. I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan. That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names. I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos. I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore. Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha. Many teachers would argue that a student designed summer project would lack information or seem to rushed. Which would not be the case at all. Many students would take their time in crafting a project that meets all standards and would probably write more than what is expected, due to the project peaking their interest. Teachers would in fact, see an increase of higher marks. However, if a teacher feels that the project is not up to standards they could always low score it and have the student try again. In allowing students to design their own project teachers will receive projects that exceed all requirements due to the students behind the projects being interested in what they were learning.\n \n If students were able to create their own summer projects, the result would be a more creative,responsible and independent thinking person. Teacher designed projects allow no room for creativity nor responsibility because there are guidelines and an examples set in place by the teacher,students have to follow. Thus, resulting in one hundred or more projects that all sound the same and lack any indication of the student's voice. Teachers would argue that summer projects must be designed by them, so that all students are able to receive full credit. Which is great in theory,but not in the long run. It does not benefit the student to have a guideline or rubric, it only benefits the teacher because the projects would be easier to grade. In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project. For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfyÂ her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects.\n \n Students should have the ability to create their own summer assignments because it would promote mental and educational growth that would otherwise be hindered in a classroom setting. Summer break allows students to embark on new experiences that can further expand their knowledge on topics that interest them. It would also allow more time for students to develop their ideas for the project. Which would strengthen their creativity and responsibility skills. Student designed projects would help grow character. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "Summer vacation offers a wonderful opportunity for adventure, creativity, and imagination often needed during a young adult's adolescence. However, many children and teens often lose their sense of work ethic during the summer, something that they worked so hard to achieve throughout the school year. To retain this sense of work ethic during the summer, many schools often require students to complete summer projects for a grade. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to ensure the project is on the right topic and to leave no room for error during grading or cheating.\n \n Firstly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed in order to leave no room for error during grading and to eliminate the possibility of cheating. When teachers design their own projects for their students, they have a clear picture of what is required of their students and how to grade them to a high standard. To ensure this, for example, teachers create rubrics that match exactly how they want projects to be done. This leaves no room for error in student projects, as they can follow word for word what the rubric says with no confusion. When students do not have rubrics and are tasked at designing a project for themselves, it is more time consuming for the teacher, as they have to grade each project individually, leaving more room for error as the projects are open-ended, and unfair as each student is then held at a different standard due to uniqueness of projects. Another example of leaving no room for error is a teacher's use of the website\n \n Turnitin. com. Turnitin is a website that teachers use that examines grammar, spelling, use of proper citations, and plagiarism. This Einstein of a website ensures that every project, paper, and presentation that is written online can successfully be graded without the worry of plagiarism, something that lazy students often turn to as a result of desperation after a long period of procrastination. Summer projects that are teacher-designed can use\n \n Turnitin as a grading system to make sure that there is no plagiarismÂ or cheating between students in the school or county, as it would be hard to do if each project was student-based, because many students often prefer to submit their projects using paper-boards or by printing them. Even though the students could have easily plagiarized or cheating on their presentations, teachers will never know unless they use\n \n Turnitin and design the project for themselves. Summer projects should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed because it ensures that every students' project will be on the same topic and graded the same way to ensure fairness, accurate grading, and more time efficiency.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic. By letting teachers design their own summer projects, students are introduced early to what they will be learning throughout the school year in order to get back into the groove of schoolwork and school. An example of these projects are advanced placement biology courses that require summer projects. These advanced placement biology projects are teacher-designed, meaning that the topic, type of presentation, and rubric are already picked for students. When the project is teacher-designed, students are able to better grasp the details of the project and have an insight on what they are going to learn in the actual course. This also helps students come to school prepared, having foreknowledge of the topic the course starts with, which boosts confidence and ease in the class, as opposed to when students design their own summer projects, which may not even be about the core topics learned class, and eventually proven to be unnecessary. Another example of how teacher-designed projects ensure that every student is doing a project on the right topic is by requiring the student to do required reading and research before the class begins, such as in literary courses that require students to read specific books throughout the course. When students are required to read specific books, such as\n \n Lord of the Flies in tenth grade and\n \n The Great Gatsby in eleventh, students are less likely to read the book, instead opting for reading a summary of the book and spoilers online, and in some cases, watching the movie. When a student is tasked with designing their own project for a book or other topic, they always choose an easier, more simple topic that requires no effort or actual understanding of the book. However, when teachers design projects, they ask for specific knowledge of the events that happened the a book, requiring students to use quotes or examples from the text, essentially forcing them to actually do the reading and create an understanding for the book themselves. This is a good thing, because it ensures that the students are actually learning, as opposed to taking the easy way out of things and barely putting effort into their project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as opposed to student-designed to make sure that every student is doing a project on the right topic because it gives students an understanding of what the course will be like to better prepare students for the fall and because it leaves no room for low-effort projects or mistakes.\n \n Though the summer is often associated with fun and adventure, it should leave no room for procrastination, a monster that eats at your work ethic and feeds on laziness. By having teacher-designed summer projects as opposed to student-designed ones, this eliminates procrastination and cheating, room for error in grading and student confusion, and gives student's an opportunity to get a head start in the course and come into the fall with a foreknowledge of the course at hand.Â",

    essay:
      "I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.\n \n When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.\n \n Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high schoolÂ college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.\n \n Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.\n \n In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as wellÂ due to the amount of time given.Â",

    essay:
      "Most schools in the United States require students to complete a summer project. Projects are assigned over the summer to assure students are learning over the long break. Most students want to enjoy their break without any school workÂ and wait until the last week of summer break to complete summer projects. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects are student-designed, students will be more creative, it gives students a senses of independence, and students will be able to explore areas of interest.\n \n However, some may disagree and say summer projects should be teacher-designed. They argue for this because if projects are student-designed they may off topic. This is a valid argument because it would make no sense if a student in a science class did a project about Fredrick Douglass. This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow. Nevertheless, their are other view points to consider.\n \n On the other hand, if summer projects were student-designed they would be more creative. Students would not be restricted and could express themselves in unique ways. In the last few decades or so, the government has made standards for students to meet. With theses standards in places teachers have to follow a very strict curriculum. More than ever before, teachers are teaching to the test which limits student creativity. With student-designed summer projects, students can express their creativity which they are limited to in the school year.\n \n In addition, allowing summer projects to be student-designed would let students to feel independent. As most students are restricted during the school year to a classroom, allowing students to design their own projects could mean they go to a local park and explore their community. In Tara Westover's memoir\n \n Educated , as a young girl she did not explore her community as a child due to her parents beliefs. As she grew up she wanted to go to college and experienceÂ something new. When she went to college it was very rewarding. This is because she was not restricted any more. Allowing students to design their own project could be a very rewarding feeling for them because of the independenceÂ they gain through it.\n \n Finally, if summer projects were to be student-designed it would allow students to explore areas of interest that may not correlate to a specific subject in school. If a student wanted to do a project about fast fashion, it does not make sense to do it in a world history, algebra, biology or band class. That is why it is beneficial to students if they design their own summer project. A student-designed summer project allows students to research a topic they might not be able to do in their classes during the school year.\n \n To conclude, letting students to design their own summer project is beneficial in more than one way. Students will be able to show off creativity that they might not show off in school. Student-designed projects gives students a sense of independence because they are not being told what to do. It also allows student to explore topics that are not taught in school. Student-designed projects have many benefits and could even lead to a careerÂ path in the future.",

    essay:
      "Sometimes over the summer, teachers will assign summer projects to students. This can put a damper on some students' summers and overall make them unhappy. However, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects it would improve upon their learning and enjoyment of their break.\n \n A lot of the time when students are assigned a project on something they don't know much about or aren't very interested in, they'll be less inclined to do the project. For example, in third grade, I entered the science fair. For the competition we were able to choose our topic rather than be assigned one. My partner and I were much more excited after finding out we could choose because that meant we would get to do our research on something we were interested and passionate about. Our passion drove us to get first place in the science fair. I don't think we would have worked as hard or been as diligent if we hadn't had the ability to choose. Another time I think of choice impacting achievement is in eighth grade. My English teacher conducted an experiment without telling any of her students. In the first quarter of the year she assigned us a paper that we could write about any topic of our choice. Later, in the third quarter, she assigned us a paper with a prompt. Even though we had learned more writing skills and were more skilled authors by the third quarter, most of the essay scores from the first quarter were better. She said just by reading the two different essays you could tell which subjects students were passionate about, and the grades reflected that. If students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose their topics, therefore inciting passion and improving upon grades.\n \n The main reason teachers assign summer projects is to add on to students' learning, right? Well, a lot of the time, if students are not interested in what they're learning, they're less prone to absorbing the information. Taking it back to my third grade science fair, a lot of my peers did a topic that their parents chose for them. Without that passion or drive behind their work, many of them did not take in any of the information they put on their tri-fold. My partner and I on the other hand, were very interested in our topic and wanted to learn as much as we could about it so we worked and studied hard. To this day I could still tell you how to make the best all natural carpet cleaner, and it was because we got to choose what our project was about. A more recent example from my life is my grades in my junior year courses. I'm personally enrolled in four classes this year, the two I see the biggest difference in grade are my film class and my math class. Film is a topic that I'm very interested in and makes me very happy. Math on the contrary, not so much. The two classes are polar opposites in the realm of stress vs. enjoyment, and my grades reflect that. It may have something to do with the course rigor, but in my opinion it has everything to do with interest and motivation. I'm much more inclined to do a film project because it brings me happiness while also engaging me and helping me receive good grades. When I look at a math assignment I'm nowhere near motivated to do it, which in turn brings down my mood and my grade because I don't put my all into the subject. Therefore I don't take in any of the information, whereas in my film class I could write you a paper on everything that we've learned since day one. Such is true for a majority of students; where interest and enjoyment peaks, so does information intake.\n \n If you ask the average student what their favorite time of year is, they'll probably answer summer. No school, warm weather, free time, fun. But when there's a project lingering over their head that they have no choice over and no interest in, it can really throw a wrench in their mood and plans. An unhappy student brews an unhappy school year, and I'm sure no teachers want that. Upon talking with many of my peers, I've come to realize that a summer assignment with no choice and no fun involved immediately creates resentment and a general dislike towards the class and the teacher involved. If students are obligated to do an boring project where the teacher has put strict guidelines, they're going to walk into the class with a preconceived notion of a boring, uninteresting course. This is going to weaken classroom morale and overall diminish scores and productivity in the classroom. However, if students are able to create their own project and do something their passionate about in relation to a course they're taking, it will ultimately make them excited to be in the class and increase their ability to succeed. I remember in my chemistry class last year, I was able to make videos for my labs. It made me excited every day to attend my science class and increased my desire to learn about chemistry. With choice comes happiness, with a happy summer comes a happy new school year.\n \n When it comes to summer projects and assignments, choice is always the route to follow. With a student-created project, students are more driven, ascertain more information, and overall have a better summer, which leads to a better school year. By comparing grades from class to class, paper to paper, or even just asking a student, it's not hard to conclude that with the ability to choose comes success in school.Â",

      "Obtaining a strong and rich education is a very valuable thing that many children across the world have access to. The school year can be very stressful due to a variety of different things, but summer is the gem that motivates many students to move forward. This three month break gives students an opportunity to prepare for the next school year, but the rate of learning during this time decreases. In order to continue a learning at a constant rate, schools have introduced summer projects. These summer projects can be designed by teachers who are interested, but can also be designed by students. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it encourages teamwork and spurs motivation.\n \n Learning how to work with other individuals is an extremely important quality. A student-designed summer project will encourage kids to communicate with one another in order to satisfy the project requests of the students as a whole. Also, communication can spur relationships and bonding among individuals. Working with others and using teamwork to achieve a certain goal creates unity. Next, teamwork is not only seen in school, but also seen in the workplace. As adults, knowing how to work together and have good communication skills with others can make ones work atmosphere more enjoyable. For example: doctors have to work together everyday to save others through sharing their knowledge and conversing with one another. Lastly, teamwork can create a decrease in social anxiety and an increase in social skills. Many students experience social anxiety while meeting new people and having conversations with others. Although anxiety can not be fully defeated, teamwork helps push kids with social anxiety to make new friends and bonds. Having students design a summer project results in more unity among the student body, social structure, and life skills for the future.\n \n Summer is a very popular time of year that is beloved by many people, especially kids. A student-designed summer project makes the perception of schoolwork in the summer more enjoyable. Having fun while doing something increases the likelihood of continuing the behavior. If a student enjoys the project they are working on, they are more likely to complete it and submit quality work. On the other hand, if the project was teacher-designed, students would most likely find the topic boring, procrastinate, and submit a poor project. A student-designed project assures that it is a topic students find fun and is more enjoyable when compared to a topic selected by a teacher. Next, having students pick their own topic also holds them more accountable to complete their work without complaints. Students who tend to procrastinate may be more motivated to complete a project that they enjoy. An enjoyable project will motivate students to do well and will not decrease the level of happinessÂ they have throughout theÂ summer.\n \n The brain is an endless archive of knowledge and memories that is always eager to learn more. Actively learning throughout the summer increases education and pushes children further on the path to success. A student-designed summer project results in the formation of unity among the student body and creates a structured work ethic.Â",

      'There is a concern that students come back to schoolÂ not being ready to learn. Matter of fact, according to\n \n Generic_City Times, 88% of students coming back from summer break are not mentally ready for school. Students and their families take vacations to free their mind off of school/work. Being off for three months for vacations/ free time, can be difficult for the students, as they come back to school. Students come back "rusty"Â orÂ not ready, because their mind is still set on having a good time with friends and not doing any homework. To solve this problem (of students not being ready for school), school boards are deciding to require summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question the school board is asking is, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be designed by the student because students will pick a topic of interest, will not get a topic that they don\'t like, and teachers may give students challenging projects students are not capable of doing.\n \n Picking your own topic for a summer project can lead to better grades. According to "Academic Awards", students achieved better grades when they work on a subject of choice. A student said at the awards, "When I got to write about Hockey, which is my favorite sport, I put so much effort and time into my paper. I loved to write about how great of a game Hockey is. I truly believe that if you are allowed to write about a topic that you have true passion for, it will lead to great success. This aspect does not only apply to school work, but also the real world." There have been many studies on how "doing the thing you love" will bring you great success. That same aspect goes with school, students learn and perform better when they are learning a subject of interest.\n \n Normally, students do not like the topic of research a teacher assigns. People who went through school know that we have always had projects/ papers that do not fit our interest. Students slack on this aspect because they do not have true passion into what they are writing (not interested) or learning. One student from Generic_School states, "My true passion was history, I loved to write about the challenges, wars, and new changes of the world. I was looking forward to writing papers about history because this is the topic that ultimately interested me, but when I had to write about a science paper, I had absolute no interest writing about it. I would make up excuses to myself on why I shouldn\'t write this paper." Teachers teach about mandatory subjects that are either boring or not interesting. If summer assigned projects are brought to the attention, then teachers should not give out their own idea of what the student has to complete.\n \n Not only do teachers pick uninteresting topics to research about, but they also pick topics that may be to challenging for the writer to complete. Teachers give out topics of study that are challenging for the student to learn about and can bring a student down (not wanting to complete the assignment). A student from Generic_City said, "If I got a paper that was teacher-designed and difficult, I would not be up to do it. We already had to go through a whole school year doing what they teacher wanted us to do, why can\'t we choose our own topic for the summer?" If a student gets a topic from a teacher that is to hard for them to achieve during summer, then they will procrastinate to finish it. Teachers have the whole school year to give out challenging projects to students, but for summer projects, a student should not be assigned hard and rigorous work.\n \n Students should design their own summer projects because they will value their project more, won\'t get a bad topic (get to choose own topic), and don\'t have to deal with challenging topics teachers hand out. There have been many factors that have been in place to deal with students not coming mentally prepared on the first day of school. Should summer be shortened? Should schools give out homework for students to complete during the summer, so learning will be longer lasting? At the end of the day, no matter what the belief is about school work being done over the summer, student should be able to design and apply their own project.Â',

      "Most students don't enjoy getting projects assigned to them to complete over summer break. If students got the opportunity to design their own projects, it may be a more enjoyable experience for the student. Students tend to forget information they've learned during the school year once summer hits. A way a number of schools attempt to prevent this situation is simply assign projects for students to complete over break. Students should have the choice to design their own projects for summer break because they are more likely to complete a project on a topic they enjoy and they will have better time management.\n \n There is a higher chance of students completing an assignment if they enjoy the topic the assignment is based on. When trying to complete a project students have no interest in, often times the motivation factor runs low. Low motivation tends to lead to unfinished projects. There is a greater chance students will complete a project they've self-designed because they will most likely be more interested and better engaged in the topic they have chosen for themselves. For example, like reading a book, a person that does not enjoy reading has a higher chance of enjoying a book if it is based upon a topic they are interested in.\n \n With a self-designed project, students will obtain better time management. During the summer, many students tend to have a packed schedule. Therefore, causes students to not make time for projects assigned to them. Leading to why having students create their own project, follows with the task of the project being completed. Better time management has a great chance of leading to a completed project. For example, a student that is joyful about an assignment they have toÂ complete, will make time for the project. Students then will have no excuse on why they couldÂ notÂ complete their projects because they have the ability to design it in a way that fits their schedule.\n \n Overall, many students don't enjoy getting assigned projects to complete over summer break.

      "Summer projects are a great way to keep students learning over the summer. Some students may find them tedious, but they are actually very beneficial by keeping the students' minds working over their extended break. But, when teachers assign such projects, sometimesÂ they are not interesting nor engaging for the students. Thus, the interesting projects over summer break should be based on the student's interest in a subject, and not determined by a teacher, who may choose a topic that the student is not interested in.\n \n Often times during the school year, students take classes on subjects which they are not interested in in order to improve their college applications; this should not be the case for summer projects. The summer is a time for students to take a break from the rigorous math and English classes they took during the school year, and relax and do the things that they love. Therefore, to keep students engaged in their summer projects, they should determine what sort of work they do. For example, a person who has read all of the Percy Jackson novels would be very interested to learn about the classic Greek myths, and would greatly enjoy their spending a portion of their summer break reading Greek mythology. But if their English teacher assigned them a reading about the plight of the Native Americans, the student would likely not do the project until the last week of summer break, and would not retain any information and would receive a poor grade to start off the new school year. It is essential that a student researches what they like, and not something that is forced upon them by a previous teacher of theirs.\n \n At Generic_School, ninth-grade students were assigned a summer reading about the civil war, in which many students did not do, and thus started off the school year with a poor grade. They were not interested in the subject and thus did not want to waste a portion of their summer break doing something they do not enjoy. Some students did well on it, though, and that is where the issue is. An individual student would likely receive a grade for this project based on their interest in the subject, instead of their abilities as to do research and make a final product out of it. This is because those who were interested in the civil war or who had abundant previous knowledge of it would get a one-hundred percent on the project because they were either very interested in it or did not have to do any research to write the essay. Those who were interested were motivated to learn about it and did lots of research. On the other hand, there were students who did not care for researching the Civil War as they did not find it interesting. Some of those students were the brightest in the class, and received a poor grade. The issue is that teacher-assigned summer projects cater to the interest of few, if any, of the students in a certain class, which causes grade discrepancies based on previous knowledge and interest, rather than ability to perform a task. Thus, if each student could choose their own topic to research over summer break and have the teacher approve it, there would be less unfair grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence.\n \n Research projects are of the utmost importance in the later stages of student life, thus students should learn how to write a good paper early on in their careers, and there is no better way to do that than to have them research a topic they are intrigued by. As previously mentioned, many students who were not interested by the topics assigned by teachers would often times not do the project or do the whole thing the night before school starts, and thus start the year off with a horrible grade. There is a more long-term effect of this issue, though. summer projects are not assigned solely for the purpose of learning the material, teachers also want students to learn how to research 3ly and write good essays. In order to do this most 3ly, though, the students must have an interest in the topic, and if their topic is their choice, they will pick one that peaks their interest and will most likely perform better on it compared to a topic which they did not choose. This will improve their essay writing and research abilities in the future, and help create a more interested and intelligent student body.\n \n To conclude, students who are required to complete summer projects should be allowed to choose the topic they will research over the summer. Summer break is a time for relaxation and fun for students, thus when they must work it should be interesting, and allowing students to choose their own topics for research would make each individual more involved in their work. The issue with teacher assigned summer projects is that they cause grade discrepancies between students of equal intelligence based on their previous knowledge of a subject. Grade discrepancies should derive from a student's ability to perform the task at hand, and not their previous knowledge or interest in the subject, and that is what happens with teacher-assigned summer projects. Finally, students develop research skills when they do well on a research project, and having students pick a topic interesting to them will increase their chances of doing well.",

      "Summer projects are a good idea to keep student's active and learning throughout the summer. They can be beneficial for some core classes such as math, history, and english, but can also be tedious and stressful during a break that should be relaxing. Haiving good intentions in mind, teachers creating summer projects for challenging courses try to make them doable and a low intesity learning experience. Even so, it does not always seem that way to the students who dread them and push them off until the last week of summer. Summer projects should be student designed because it is the students' learning, their grade is dependent upon the work, and sometimes a teacher will present too much work.\n \n Whether or a not a student wants to learn is completely their choice, and they will deal with the positive and negative effects. For example, some students think that having a summer project for a challenging course is pointless because they will likely just forget everything by the start of the school year. This can prove to be true, or it can lead to their struggling grades and other consequences. Very few people actually want to do work over summer break, so it is up to the student to decide what is important to them and how they want to prepare for school. Some students do well with shorter reviews, while others need long practices to relearn what they did not understand. Students should design summer projects so that they can customize them to their individual needs.\n \n Along with the negative consequences a student must understand that their grade in the class is dependent upon how much work they do over them summer, so designing the summer project would be beneficial in helping them improve. Most classes that require summer assignments start off the in the first quarter with an assumption that they students completely understand the material that was supposed to be covered over the summer. With most classes, a student will skip around the summer asignment and just try to do the things they need to work on, jumbling knowledge up in their head as they try to organize themselves. Understanding what they need to work on, the students can design a summer projet that would help in areas of weakness in hopes of improving their school grades. This will be helpful in the future because the students can individually learn and then bring what they have learned throughout the summer back to the classroom and help others.\n \n Lastly, in designing summer projects, teachers tend to compile a ton of needless work that none of the students do. For instance, in an AP class the teacher usually thinks that they more you practice the better you will get, which is usually true. Because of this mindset they will put together pages of practice tests, and notes for a student to complete throughout the summer causing absolute chaos and a huge amount of stress. Despite practice making perfect, no one wants to fill out papers over the summer. Since the students know their workload from other classes and what they are capable of, they can put together a decent amount of work that is not too long. If the students were to design summer projects they would be more inclined to do them because it would not be such a tedious amount of work.\n \n Even though teachers make summer projects because they design the learning plan for the year, students would get much more out of them if they made them together because of the learning aspect that comes with it. Students should design them because they would be able to identify their weaknesses collectively, and create practices that would help them in the future. This is much better than teachers compiling useless, terrifying tests from randomn websites that are pushed off until the last week of summer.",

    essay:
      "Summer! Often described as a time to sit back and relax, a summer vacation can be seen as the antithesisÂ to any opportunity for learning. However, summer projects allow for learning to continue throughout the year. Summer projects should be student driven, due to the fact that they allow for self-motivation and individualism, as long as teachers are able to monitor the progress and quality of the work being done.\n \n A teacher-designed summer project does not allow for the same amount of individualism that could stem from a project designed by a student. Giving specific requirements for a summer project for an entire class of students will produce a number of cookie-cutter responses with no variety from student to student. This is because forcing students to fit into a mold limits any possible chance of self-expression. The entire point of creativity is to be outside of the norm, but that is impossible with a teacher-designed project, because 'the norm' is exactly what it is designed for.\n \n Furthermore, in a standard educational setting, students are not able to pick and choose what interests them, and this can lead to a lack of motivation during the normal school year. Finding a subject that one is passionate about is integral to continuing the joy of learning and of new discoveries that is so often lost in the later years of formal education. This is not anÂ issueÂ for student-designed summer projects.Â Allowing students to pick what interests them for a summer project would solve this issue. With no parameters set by teachers, the educational possibilities are endless for a student.\n \n However, regardless of how much a student is willing to learn on their own during summer vacation with a student-based project, teachers still have their place in this system. Checks and balances are necessary for any system like this to function, and summer projects are no different. Some parametersÂ for these summer projects should be set by teachers. Otherwise, there is no way to ensure that actual learning is taking place during what is supposed to be a learning experience. Teachers also need to have the ability to grade any given project, which would be difficult to do objectively if no parameters were given to the projects.\n \n Learning does not stop at the end of high school, and it certainly does not stop at the end of a school year. Student-designed projects allow for creativity and individualism from each and every student, and allowing teachers to have a guiding-but not controlling-hand in the projects can lead to fantastic academic results.Â",

      "Did you know the 75% of high school studentsÂ do their summer assignments in the last week of the summer. Some even do it in the first week of school. This percent would decrease if the students projects were self chosen. It would help them by giving them the choice of doing what they want to do. They would be able to be more creative, be able to do it faster so they can enjoy their summer and some families money is a struggle and they can't afford the teacher directed projects so they can do what works for them.\n \n When a project is student directed they have the freedom to do what they want and be creative with it and actually enjoy doing the project. I have had hundreds of projects in my eleven years of schooling and some of my favorite ones were in my cooking class last year. My favorite one in that class was a food truck project. My teacher said you have to make a cardboard box food truck, make a menu, and make one item on the menu. Otherwise we were free to do what we wanted. I ended up making some really good food because she said just do what you want. I alsoÂ ended up getting a good grade because I could be creative on that project.\n \n One major problem with summer assignments is that students either forget about them and don't do them or they pushÂ them off until the last minute. I am one of those students that procrastinates until the last minute to do my AP summer assignments. It makes it very challenging to do them when there is only one week in summer left and I want to have fun and enjoy the last parts of the summer. I have friends that are worse than me and either don't do the AP work at all or they do them at the beginning of the school year, but if they were self chosen they would not have the issue of not wanting to do them because they can do what ever they want and make it what they feel is good.\n \n My final reason is more on the extreme side but I have seen it happen. It is where the teachers summer work is a large project that is simple but costly and some families that I have seen do not have enough money to do the project. They normally end up failing the project because they never did the work, but if they could do what they want for it they could've passed. Where if they were short on money and it was limiting them on what they could do if they needed to they could do a less expensive project and save their money for other things.\n \n There are many other reasons that students should be able to do their own thing for their projects over the summer but here are just a few of the reasons that people say that they should remain teacher directed. It's that it is a lot easier for the teacher to grade based on what they are looking for because they can grade on their scale of how close it is to what they want. But when it is student choice they can be creative and have fun, the project can go faster and they can enjoy their summer for what is it and it can be more cost 3 for the families that have lower incomes.",

      'Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.\n \n As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.\n \n However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will "slack off" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of "what is the effect of temperature on ice?" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.\n \n In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students\' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too "obvious" or easy.\n \n Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher. Students should be given every opportunity to learn on their own and explore their individual passions.Â Â Â Â',

      "Summer homework, one of the most scary phrases said by any teacher. Many schools and teachers require projects to be completed over the Summer to keep topics fresh in students minds while the students are on break. While this train of thought does make sense, these projects should be designed by the students. It is unreasonable to think that students should work around the teachers schedule during the summer, as if they hadn't been doing that the entire school year. Student designed assignments would allow the children to continue their learning while still being able to go on vacation and work at their jobs. It would also allow them to become more engaged with what they are learning, as they would be be in the drivers seat of their learning, making it more enjoyable. It would also let the teachers get a better understanding of their students and where their level of comprehension is with a certain topic. Student designed projects would allow for the students to learn, while also allowing them to have fun during their break.\n \n Typically, when teachers assign homework over the break, they schedule due dates and assignments when it is beneficial to them, and not quite as much as the students. Giving the power to the students to make their own time lineÂ to help alleviate the stress of the projects, makes the assignments seem like less of a chore and helps them learn the content. A couple years ago, a teacher of mine assigned our class three books to be read over the summer. The first book had to be read by the end of June along with a quick report. Too bad for me, I was in Italy with my family, that I hadn't seen for a year, for the month. During the vacation I was barely able to spend time with my family as I was trying to read the assigned book and write a report. Because of this teacher designed summer assignment, I missed quality family time and rushed to finish my report. These restraints that wouldn't have happened if the schedule was student designed, caused me to not learn anything because I was too rushed, and also made me lose time with my family. If students were able to design a schedule for their assignments this would take away the stress that comes along with set due dates.\n \n Another thing many teachers like to do, is to assign \"busy work.\" Teachers assign busy work just to be able to say that the students are learning and working. During the Summer, Teachers often assign busy work to meet the schools requirement of a summer project. Often times this includes long packets, that students simply have to complete. They are extremely time consuming and non beneficial to the children. For example, let's say a science teacher requires the students to complete a project on the different bird species of the region. One student might really benefit from a book about the birds and learn from it, but another student is more of a visual learner. With a student designed project, the first student could read his book about the specific birds, while the other creates a project on the different species he sees around his neighborhood while documenting what he sees. Summer projects shouldn't all be the same, because everyone is different. If students were able to control how they were learning, everyone would be able to create a project that works best for them, which makes it easier to understand what they need to learn.\n \n Many might think, that the teachers don't benefit from student designed projects, and this plan just reverses the stress to the teachers. But, not only would student made projects be beneficial to the children, it would also be beneficial to the teachers as well. Student made projects would allow teachers to gauge where each students level of comprehension of a certain subject/topic is and where each student needs a little extra help. Let's say a history teacher lets their students create a project about the government branches. One student writes about all of the branches of government but leaves out the fact that the President is a part of the Executive branch from their project. The teacher now knows what they should review in the upcoming school year. Since the project is in control by the students they are able to learn what they want and how they want, this freedom allows the teachers to help the students learn even further as they now have a better understanding of what the children's strengths and weaknesses are. While these students were learning about history their teacher was learning about them.\n \n Leaving the students in charge of their summer assignments, benefits all those involved, from the teachers to the students. It lets students feel more relaxed during the break while also allowing them to learn at their own pace and more 3ly. It allows the teachers to get a better understanding of where their students are so theyÂ can grow as teachers by knowing what the kids struggle with and how to improve in the future.\n \n So, if teachers are required to give students Summer assignments, hand the keys to the kids and let them drive.",

    essay:
      "Over the summer, many student spend their time doing nothing to keep their minds active and engaged in education. Many schools and teachers want children to continue creating learning experiences and mentally developing over the summer. One way they can do this is to assign a summer project for a student. While many of these projects might be created and outlined by the teacher, I personally think that Students should design and create their own individual projects because it would help them to grow as independent learners, it would allow them to create something that they would be enthusiastic about and would put more effort into. and it would also help the teacher see more clearly how 3ly a student is progressing as a learner.\n \n One important reason that summer projects should be student designed is the fact that creating a whole project from scratch would help a child to become a far more independent learner, and would prepare them for their later stages in life. When a student reaches college, it would be pretty overwhelming for them to have to take a bunch of classes that were all almost completely independent if they had never been given the opportunity to grow in their independence as a person in middle or high school. A student designed project might be quite scary for many students, but I think that it is definitely necessary in order to be set up for long term success in their personal endeavors throughout their later years in education, as well as their career afterwards. Many jobs are highly independent and require for somebody to be diligent in their own efforts. For example, my dad is an engineer, and he has deadlines that are agreed on by him and the people that pay him for completing work for them, and if he doesnt meet a deadline, the client would most likely not be happy and never come back to get more work done from him.\n \n Another big reason that summer projects should be student made is that it would allow for students to be more creative, and work on something that they are very enthusiastic about, which would in turn make it easier for the student to work hard and do well on the project. If a student is assigned a topic that they completely hate, they would be extremely unenthusiastic about the project, and would definitely not want to work on it, especially during the summer months, when there are so many other things they would rather be doing. It would probably lead to procrastination on a project that would leave a student with not enough time to properly do the project to the best of their abilities. A project that a student is enthusiastic about could also lead to a student feeling confident in their abilities, and they would be encouraged to try their best and do well throughout the year to keep their positive momentum flowing.\n \n It would also be extremely helpful for a teacher to be able to see how a student is functioning and is progressing on their own terms. At the end of the day, the teachers job is to guide and lead us until we are independent enough to thrive on our own. If the projects were self designed, it would be an extremely helpful tool for future teachers to look back on and guage how much work a student needs on their independence journey before they can leave without facing struggle or uncertainty throughout their life. These self designed projects would help a teacher to clearly see each level of assistance needed by each and every student.\n \n All of these reasons that argue that projects should be student designed revolve around one thing: independence. I think that independence is the single most important thing that you have to prepare for in order to be ready for college. If a student was not independent in college, they would flounder around without being able to properly learn and develop the skills they need to succeed after college. Middle and High schools need to take steps towards challenging their students with independence to create self-sustaining, educated people that can truly help to make a positive difference throughout their communities and make the world a better place.",

Yes, students should be given some sort of summer project that corresponds with their class for the following year. students spend roughly eight months in school and once summer comes all the academic knowledge they acquired over the school year is lost the day they walk out the school doors. students should stay in some sort of school environment so they do not fall behind or lose as much prior knowledge about the subject. students could connect with their teachers for the next academic school year and receive their project from them, to turn in the first week of school.\n \n Many students need the extra summer project to keep them in the flow of things. Some students don't need the extra project they are always in a school mindset and keep there grades up. However, that is not the case for every individual student. A summer project would be no ones favorite summer activity but, it would benefit students for their next academic school year. therefore, students would already be in school mode and be more prepared and less likely to fail a semester due to lack of knowledge.\n \n Students should be able to come up with their own creative idea whether it be for a science project or an English essay.

      "As the school year ends and summer break begins, many students cease to learn or do any education-related activities. Some schools require their students to complete summer projects to assure that the students continue to learn over the duration of their three-month summer break; however, there has been an ongoing debate on whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Those who disagree state that these summer projects should be designed by the teachers, but this not true. Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. One reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to demonstrate their ambiguity. For example, a student may have interests in a particular subject and may do a project that is displayed through an ambiguous media platform. That project format would not be able to be displayed if the projects were designed by the teachers. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to be creative with their projects. A student may want to be creative and show their ability to carve marble statues, or their ability to do ventriloquism. In another instance, a student may want to be creative with their project topic and may want to conduct research on a rarely known species of insects that they learned about while visiting South America during their summer vacation. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, students should be able to design their own projects because it allows students to learn more about a topic that interests them. A teacher designed project may inquire about a student's knowledge of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or Newton's Laws; however, these topics wouldn't interest many students and the amount of precision and thought put into the projects would be lackluster. By allowing a student to control their project's topic, the teachers are giving the students freedom to roam and think about what they are going to learn about.\n \n There are further reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. When a teacher allows a student to choose a topic for a project, it allows the teachers to understand a student's level of learning, as well as a student's level of thinking. Most students will be appreciative of the fact that they're able to conduct a project of their choice and will give their best effort while completing the project. As a teacher grades a student's project, that teacher is able to gauge what the student was thinking as they created their project. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that when a student is given the freedom to conduct their own research for a project topic, that student is able to give a demonstration of their innovation. Many students have strong innovation skills, but during the school year they are assigned different assignments that prohibit students from using their innovative nature. For example, if a student has an interest in airplanes, they may want to do a project pertaining to airplanes; teacher-designed projects would not allow a student to explore this area of innovation within themselves, which may cause them to lose interest in the topic. One more reason that the projects should be student-designed is that by conducting one's own research and designing one's own project, a student may explore new topics that may peak their interest. For example, while researching the hardships and difficulties of underwater welding, a student may learn about another profession that they did not know existed. This simple occurrence may sway a multitude of that student's life choices: which major they will pursue in college, which profession they may want to pursue after college, or if that student may still want to go to college after high school instead of going to a trade school.\n \n Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. Those who disagree state that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be teacher-designed, but there are a plethora of reasons that this is false. These projects should be student-designed for a multitude of reasons: students are able to be more creative and ambiguous when choosing their own project design, students are able to be more innovative when choosing their own project design, students are given the opportunity to learn about new topics, and when students are given the chance to design their own project, teachers are able to gauge students' thinking and cognitive skills levels. By allowing a student to design their own project, that student is bound to become a more independent thinker and innovator; thus, creating a brighter future for the generations to come.",

      "When summer finally begins, the last thing a student even considers thinking about is anything that is school related. The infamous summer project stands to change that. This topic, the summer project, coupled with my predetermined ideologies to what summer should represent lead me to the conclusion that if summer projects are to be a requirement for students, they should be designed by the student, for the student. The reasons students should have the right to design their own projects include, but are not limited to, the fact that giving students a say would let them express, and learn about, themselves creatively, the fact that students can make something they are passionate about, and the idea that summer is not a time to be doing school work.\n \n If students acquire the right to design their own summer projects, they would most likely make the project in a manner that would be both fun and educational at the same time. This is exactly what I did in the 10th grade, when I was assigned a video project in the class Driver's Education. I had never recorded a video for school purposes, and I never learned to edit either. The video project made learning to edit a necessity. I not only learned how to edit because of the video, but I also learned that making and editing videos can be extremely fun! It showed me that I love to make people laugh, and honestly, I may want to pursue making and editing videos one day. Students could choose a video project, or any other way to channel their creativity through this project. In doing so, in choosing how the project is designed, they may learn something new about themselves, and it gives students a chance to show, or maybe even find, their creative side.\n \n By giving students the right to design their own summer projects, you are giving students the chance to make something with the passions they have. This would have an extremely positive effect, as they would now be working on the project with an unconventional mindset, at least in the context of school work. This change in their mindset would make it easier for the project to be done, as the unique things each student loves are being incorporated. This would also drastically increase the quality of work, as they are doing something they love. Allowing students to incorporate their passions would also show teachers how each student is unique in their own way. Student designed summer projects may also create a new interest for whatever topic the project is on, as students would be more inclined to make a cocktail of their interests and school-related topics rather than isolating the two.\n \n Over the 10 months that make up the school year, students are in a constant state of stress, due in part by the work that they must do. Summer is a time for students to unwind, and to forget what it means to be a stressed out, overworked, and sleep deprived student. A time to relax. A time, for once in a student's life, to put the work, and the stress that comes with it, down for an extended period of time. If students are to be required to complete a summer project, they should, at the very least, have a choice in how they will design said project. As it will ease the sting of having to do school work in a time where no school work should be done in the first place. One may say, \"Anytime is a time to do school work!\" And while I see where they are coming from, school is out of session for a reason. Summer vacation is a time to be away from school and all of the psychological endeavors it brings with it. Which is why I know, definitively, that school work should not be issued out during the summer in the first place, and because of this, if school work is to be issued, the school, at the very least, should give the students the right to design their summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, students, without a shadow of a doubt, should be given the right to design their summer projects. Through designing their summer projects, students can learn about who they are creatively, they can incorporate what they are passionate about into the summer project, and finally, students can feel better about having to do a project during the summer, as they will at least have a choice in what that project is. All of these benefits are extremely valuable, as they will have a positive effect towards a student's life, as they can learn new things about themselves, and show people a bit of who they are. These positive effects would be an impossibility if the flexibility that comes from giving students the right to design their summer projects is not given in the first place. Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Most students try their best to avoid learning over the summer. As a result, they forget the knowledge they learned in the prior school year and aren't prepared for the upcoming school year. To get used to learning again, student's brains need to be refreshed and stimulated in the beginning of every school year.\n \n As an attempt to solve this problem, teachers assign summer projects. Students, often times, despise these projects because they are boring and stressful. However, these projects are neccessary because they ensure students don't forget about school. To make the projects more enjoyable for students, they should design the projects instead of teachers. Student-designed projects would be better because they focus on their interests, have higher quality, and be less stressful.\n \n In most cases, students don't find school work interesting because the topics aren't based around things students care about. Students get tired of learning about the same meaningless things that have no value in their lives. The things they are taught in school can't be applied to the real world and are based around a broken system that focuses on grades and memorization, not learing. Student-designed projects would focus on their interests. Students would actually want to learn compared to falling asleep in their history class listening to something that happened 900 years ago. Students could assign themselves a project based on a book they enjoy or a phenonom they find mysterious. Students would work and have fun doing it. The projects would still be educational and purposeful, but students wouldn't feel forced to do it.\n \n It is a known fact that if people love what they do, they will put more effort into it. When people don't enjoy their work, they don't care as much and don't try as hard. This concept can be applied to student-designed projects. For once, students would be excited to work and learn because they get the chance to do something their passionate about. Students would put more effort into their projects. As a result, their quality of work and overall project would be much better compared to if they had to work on a teacher-designed project. They would get higher grades and teachers would be impressed with their work.\n \n School is extremely stressful for students throughout the school year. The workload is intense and hard to manage. Teachers give difficult test and assign massive piles of homework that students have to complete for typically seven classes. Students feel pressure to attain good grades. This can lead to terrible sleep patterns, mental breakdowns, and anxiety attacks. Outside factors can also add to their stress. Students have to deal with their social and family problems, which can be emotionally traumatizing. Students also partake in clubs and sports or have jobs that just add to their workload. Summer is a much needed break for students because they can escape from the stress that the school year brings. On their break, the last thing students want is another stressful project. Student-designed projects would reduce their stress significantly. They wouldn't feel as much pressure to meet their teachers standards and would wouldn't procrastinate as much. Student-designed projects would encourage learning for students without incorporating the factor of stress that comes along with school work.\n \n Some might say that student-designed projects wouldn't focus on real topics or be taken seriously by the students. However, teachers could approve the designs to make sure they are educational. Teachers can also grade the projects like teacher-designed projects to make sure students don't blow the project off. Students will enjoy these projects much more because they can have fun with it. These projects will also help them learn over the summer break and prepare them for the school year. Student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects because they focus on the students interests, increase their quality of work, and take away stress. Student-designed summer break projects should be implemented into more school systems around America.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "A lot of schools in America require students to do summer projects to make sure they are exercising their knowledge during the 3 month break, some schools believe they should let the students choose the projectÂ they are going to complete, some schools believe they should let the teachers decide what the students will do.\n \n I believe the students should decide what the project will be, because the summer should be a time where students are taking their break off from school, so the teachers might give the students a really hard and long project that takes a lot of effort to do not knowing how it feels like, so i believe the school should get ideas for what project they will be giving out to the students from the students, choose their favorites from that list so the students dont pick something that is too easy and gives them barely any knowledge out of it, and then let the students vote for what they want to do.\n \n An example of this is at a school in Dubai, where they placed a closed box in every class and let everybody get a peice of paper, write their idea down, fold it and then put the folded peice of paper inside the box,than they open all of these boxes and pick 50 different prompts, then they make a survey and make every student vote for what they want to do out of these 50 different prompts, the one with the most votes gets chosen.\n \n In conclusion, every school should let the students control some of the decisions made, it gives them more freedom and makes them feel like they have a say on whats going on in their lives instead of letting other people decide for them.",

    essay:
      "Many schools require students to do projects in the summer. These projects can be designed by teachers or students. The projects are created so the student can continue to learn over their break; but can become a problem if the student doesn't like the type of project given to them by the teacher. This is why students should be able to design their own projects. Students should be able to design their own project because they will be able to be more creative and comfortable; but teachers should design the project simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student when it comes to the topic.\n \n First, when students can design their own project, they will be more creative and will be more likely to show what they know. The student being more creative on their project will show that that they understand the topic and don't have to follow a simple and easy format. For example, personally, I have had summer projects like my \"Of mice of men\" book project that was just flat out boring and not fun because the teacher gave us no room to be creative in anyway. Many students want to be creative with their projects, but when the project doesn't look appealing or will not let us be creative, we don't get a very good chance to show what we know. Then compared to my personal reading book project, where I had the freedom of being able to be creative and could show my understanding of the book. It showed the difference between being able to designing your own project or being given a teacher designed, simple project.\n \n Furthermore, personally, when a teacher has given me a specific format; there is the feeling of uneasy because I feel if I don't follow the format, the project will be completely wrong. This example doesn't let the student feel comfortable and makes the student feel that they can't be creative in their own way. When a student gets the chance to design their own projects, the students will naturally be more comfortable. This can be shown by the students work and effort put into their projects. Being comfortable with a project for the students is a big deal because if the students don't feel comfortable, how will the students show what they have learned during their projects. A student designed project helps because it is based off of what they want to do and not something they were given.\n \n Although, when the teachers design the projects, the teachers will know more on the topic rather than the students. This can make it to where the teachers specifically designs the projects to the topic of choice. Since the teachers design the projects, they can create and use different kinds of formats. The teachers can also choose the type of projects the students can use. This can and will give the students more options on their projects than just one, and the students can choose the type of projects based on their strengths and weaknesses. Since the teachers know more on the topic of the projects they can use that to be creative themselves by designing a project for the students that isn't something most of the students have seen before.\n \n In conclusion, since many schools require students to do projects over the course of summer. Students should be able to design their own projects based off of them being able to be more creative and being more comfortable; but teachers should design the projects simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student on the topic. Work shows when a student is comfortable with their project. When they're comfortable the can aslo become more creative. After all of these statements and supporting evidence this is why students should be able to design their own summer projects.",

      "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed to keep it simple. Teacher-designed projects are usually time consuming, boring, and complicated. The summer projects should be fun, easy, and less time consuming for students. Students wouldn't want to do a project that could take up their entire summer break; they don't deserve it. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are able to decide how much time they want to spend on it and how easy or creative they want it to be.\n \n Summer break is the time students are off from school. If they were to have teacher-designed projects, it'll make them feel like their still in school. Students are supposed to enjoy summer break, not be focused on a project given by a teacher that could stress them out. Most times, students don't do the project at all for reasons like: \" Oh it's boring\", \" I didn't have time\", \" I couldn't understand it\", or \" It's too much work\". Teacher-designed projects are not right for students, especially since it's over the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects will allow students to have an enjoyable summer. If they create their own project, they have control on what they do. Students will still be learning by themselves with what they decide to create. If the student does not want to spend the whole summer working on the project, it will be okay because they're the one making the decisions. The students can make their project easy and fun with things like: Colors, Pictures, and Glitter. Students will be able to enjoy their summer break because their project will be fun and easy for them.\n \n Everyone has their own opinion for these two choices. If it were to be discussed by teachers only, they would most likely choose teacher-designed projects. If it were to be discussedÂ by students only, they would most definitely choose students-designed projects. Between teachers and students discussing it, it would basically be a 50/50, but the teachers should really give students the chance to create something and learn on their own. It's best for the summer projects to be students-designed to have it easy on them.Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects as a way to make sure they are still learning during their time off. To some students this sounds not ideal because if their getting a break from school then why would they want still be responsible for school work. While others may like keeping their mind stimulated while they are on break. Even in both cases the projects being required should be able to be student-designedÂ projects. Most students like having a choice of assignments or work so they can pick whats best suited for them and their strengths. The student-design offers more to the student then the teacher-design because the students are the ones who have the greater idea on what they are doing. Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety.\n \n Being interested in a particular subject or idea would most likely increase the effort and time you put in to what pertains to the subject. Even thought its during the summer more students would completeÂ a assignment that appeals to their interests rather then a standard project that teachers have assigned for years. For example if a student who likes Rap or Hip-Hop music is assigned to a research paper about all the major wars that the United States fought in they might not feel an appeal to do the project or at least not put in a lotÂ of effort in ; if that same student was allowed to research the same topic but create is own song or rap about it would increase the interest about the project and the effort put in. There would be guidelines and rules about how the student can complete the assignment and the subject matter but as a overall the project would be student design based. Although some students might not have a preference on any type of assignment or if the teacher assigns everyone one universal project most would use their interest to create a project they would enjoy doing. Letting student summer projects be student-design would increase the interest in the project.\n \n Students are going to to what they want in most cases so making the summer projects student design based will help have larger completion rate of projects. If what a student is being told to do is not something they agree with they will most likely not do it or turn it in or halfway complete it so it is not to its full potential. However if a choice is given or if the project is student design based it will more likely get done and done well. As an example if the teacher design based project was a four page paper then more then likely people are not going to do it because writing is not their personal strong suit, but if their was a choice of a four minute video project about the same same topic it gives student who have different abilities to excel just as much as others in their own personal way. While the student design will increase the amount of students who do the project their will always be students who just don't do it but at least for the students who do it,Â a bigger outlet is givenÂ so they can complete it in a way they they can understand or what they excel in. The student design gives student a bigger window so it can help them complete the assignment and have it done well.\n \n Student-designed projects would get the students more interested in the projects which then more students would complete the assignment in its entirety. The projects assigned are ultimately for the benefit of the student in the long run so having the assignment be student based would greater benefit the student. Some think that since the teachers are mastered in their subject matter it should be a teacher design based project but then the student might feel smothered or boxed in by how they feel about the whole project in general which would be doingÂ the opposite of benefiting the student. A student design based project would be the best way for the student so succeed.Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "School is stressful. Not only during the school year but now during the summer. From extracurricular activities to preparing for the upcoming year, the summer can also be a time of stress. Students from all over America are forced to participate in summer projects designed to reinforce the information they learned during the school year. While this idea makes perfect sense, one must evaluate how these projects are designed. Summer projects should be student designed because this can improve creativity and eliminate stress; although one could argue that eliminating structure would result in a poor learning opportunity, teachers must think positively about every student's potential.\n \n In school, almost every project is teacher-designed. This occurs so that teachers can assess a set of skills a student can perform. However, implementing a student-designed project would help students find their true passion in a field and help them become more creative individuals. For instance, when a student is forced to create a science experiment on a specific wild plant, there is no creativity involved in selecting what to study. However, if a student could choose which plant to study and what experiment to do, it could improve a student's creative thinking skills. This student-designed project would also help students find their passion for science by having them discover a plant that truly interests them. Summer projects should be student-designed because of the increased creativity and innovation when students can choose what to study.\n \n Nowadays, stress is apparent with almost every student. The stress of pleasing teachers is often what forces students into a hatred towards school. When a teacher designs a project for a student to complete, it can turn a potentially fun learning opportunity into a dreadful and stressful assignment. For instance, if a student is forced to complete a history project on Abraham Lincoln, a student may see this as just another thing to be completed. However, if a student is given the opportunity to complete a history project on any president, he/she may find it entertaining to research one of their favorite people in history. This can greatly benefit the student because many students learn best when they are not stressed out about a specific goal. The lack of stress causes them to have a relaxed time while still obtaining valuable knowledge.\n \n While summer projects are valuable to ensure that students have retained information, they should not be teacher-designed. The summer should be a time where students can choose what to work on in order for them to truly find their passion. This can help to improve a student's creativity by allowing them to participate in an activity they are truly interested in. Similarly, this can help a student to eliminate stress by finding enjoyment in their project.Â",

      "Summer is a time for students to take the stress off of school and to have fun with their friends. Some schools think kids should still have projects throughout the summer to continue their learning. Each school is different, some schools have the teachers come up with the project, while others lets the students make it. Schools should have teacher-designed projects for the summer because it would get students ready for what they will learn that year, teachers could count it as a grade once school starts, and it would be an easy project that would not take too long to do.\n \n If a teachers got to come up with the project they make it on the one of the topics the students would learn that year. They know what they will be teaching, so they would make the projects on specific units to prepare you for the class. Doing this is great because it will get the students ready and interested into the subject early on. This will help the students for when they start school they will already know a littleÂ about the topic. The more students know to start with the better they might do in the class.\n \n Another great thing is if the teacher designed the project, then they could count the project as a grade to get the school year started. This is good because right off the bat the student could have a good grade if they do the project correctly. Knowing this more people, for sure, would do the project. Starting the year off with a good grade can help benefit you later on, if you start to struggle a little bit. The project would be easy, so it would be easy to get a good grade, which is a great way to start a school year with. The more students doing the project, the more students you will have thinking and getting involved in school during the summer.\n \n The teachers would make it a fairly easy project that would not take the whole summer to do. Summer is the teachers vacations as well, and they know as much as the kids do that they want to relax. Lots of kids travel and hangout with friends during summer and teachers know that, so they would make it a pretty fair and easy project. Doing projects like these kids get more involved and excited to do them. If teachers did a simple, and maybe even a little fun, project it would keep the kids thinking and yet not stressed out.\n \n Some might say that the students should design the project. They think this because they say the students could make it their own and they would be more interested if they got to choice what they wanted to do. Although some people say that, if a student got to choice their topic or how they want to do their project they would do it too easy for themselves. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers because it would be on a subject they will learn later that year, the teachers could count it as a grade, and they would make it a simple and fun project to do. Everyone benefits more if the teachers made the projects rather than the students.Â",

      "Imagine summer break coming to an end you would want to make memories with friends and family, but you can't because you have to do your summer project. When it comes to summer assignments many students will put it off until the last moment. They will do this for a number of reasons maybe they were on vacation, had trouble with their family, or just didn't like the assignment. Regardless of the reason in the last moments of summer they must rush to complete this assignment for the next school year. Summer projects should be student-designed because of students interest, schedules, and emotional health.\n \n Summer assignments should be student-designed because of different students interest. Some students may be interested in math while others might like scienceÂ or history more. If a student likes math but is required to do a history summer assignment they will not want to do it because they are not motivated to do something they do not like. Some may say that regardless of what classes students like they will do the assignment anyways because they have to. While that is true it would be better to let the students choose what they want instead of trying to force them to continue learning over summer break.\n \n Students schedules are not always as simple as teachers think so giving a lot of work to do over the summer might not be best for them. Students have a lot going on in their daily lives spending time with friends, sports, religion, and family emergencies. These are some things that constantly impact students lives on a daily basis, and if they are dealing with a lot over the summer they might have difficulties finding time to do the assignments teachers give them. Although most students have a lot going on so it not a valid reason for students to put off their work or not do it. However students know their schedule better than teachers they could design a project that they could fit into their schedules and complete on time.\n \n Students in their teens or lower are often feeling many emotions through the year but teachers probably don't think about that as they assign summer projects. A student getting a projectÂ they don't think they can handle while they are dealing with a lot at home could push them to make a bad decision like doing drugs or getting in a fight. Students could be feeling stressed, angry, or sad and getting an assignment they might not think they can handle could make them act out in unpredictable ways. Some may say that getting a project has no impact on a students emotion health. However the fact is all students have different conditions that they live or grew up in so when teachers assign projects they can't assume that all students are fine. If students could chose their own summer assignments they could chose something that would not feel so overwhelming to them.\n \n The whole point of summer break is so students get a chance to relax and prepare themselves for the next school year. While it is important for students to do a little work so they don't forget what they have learned so far, teachers should not force the work on them and they should not feel like it is too much to handle. In the past teachers designed the summer projects and students just had to deal with it but that system is flawed. Does it really help students review what they have already learned? What's to stop them from copying the assignment from a friend. Going forward students should have the choice to design their own summer project with the help of a teacher. While it is best for them to feel comfortable and want to keep learning over the summer teachers need to make sure that it covers the right material and that it is not too easy.",

    essay:
      "Throughout the span of a student's 3 month summer break, it is inevitable that their acquired knowledge from the previous school year will gradually decline due to the sudden ceasing of education for this period of time. Many teachers, however, believe that it is crucial for a student to continue their studies throughout the summer break in the form of a project that will allow the student to apply their knowledge through hands-on means. However, in order to ensure that a student gains the most benefit from this summer project experience, it is only reasonable that the student design the entirety of the project because it allows them to be more engaged in it, it builds and improves a student's creativity, and it allows a teacher to understand the mind of a student and his or her preferences after a full year of solely teacher-based tests, assignments, and projects.\n \n The mind of a student is an interesting place, and it seems as if they favor self authority rather than an authoritative figure controlling and molding them to see their own way and not the way of the student. This is also observed throughout infancy and early childhood; people of this age take a liking towards having something done their own way rather than strictly obeying a parent or guardian. Likewise, a student prefers to mold and shape their own experiment or project rather than being coerced to attend to the wants of a teacher. This notion is based on the simple fact that one favors their own choices, as this initiates a sense of freedom in a person. If a summer project assigned to a student is based on the preferences and views of a student, the student has the ability to adjust the assignment in accordance with what they want, and this allows for a higher degree of engagement in a student. For example, if a student has an interest towards environmental science and a strong dislike towards US history, a teacher-given summer project that revolves around US history and is based strictly on the teacher's guidelines is 1 due to the fact that the student would not show a high level of interest for that teacher-based project. As a result, the student wouldn't feel the need to perform his best on the project due to his disinterest. However, if the student were to have a voice in the choosing of a project based on environmental science, the student would transfer his passion of the subject onto the project and perform his best due to his engagement in the topic of the project and the lack of control and authority given to the teacher in this case. Therefore, a student-designed project results in more engagement from the student.\n \n One of the most striking, intriguing characteristics of a person is that of creativity. The human mind is capable of doing wonders that are unfathomable to some; however, this can only be achieved through exhibiting one's creativity. A summer project designed by a student opens many doors and directions to take; from an informative poster to a vivid animation, the possibilities are endless. These array of options force a student to utilize their creative potential. Moreover, a student-based project allows one to 'think outside the box', meaning that they are able to create a project that exceeds the standards and expectations of a teacher. Through these various options at the hands of a student, the high level of creativity has the potential to transfer onto numerous other skills and positively influence them. At an early age, it is vital to utilize creativity to the best of one's ability, as this skill will benefit a student later in their life when an occupation or professor expects that student to exemplify their creativity.\n \n Throughout the entirety of the school year, the manner by which each test, assignment, and project is created is solely in the hands of a teacher. In other words, students do not have the ability to shift or change the perspective of a teacher and what the teacher prefers. However, a student-designed summer project is the one opportunity for a student to exhibit their power and allow a student to influence the manner by which the project is done. After a difficult, enduring school year, it is only reasonable that the student has the power to create their own means of work rather than sticking to the teacher handing out the project with strict guidelines and restrictions.\n \n Furthermore, this opportunity for a student allows the teacher to examine the potential of a student after the school year, including the student's creativity, intelligence, and ability to create a successful project when the outcome of the project relies on the student rather than the teacher. All in all, this one opportunity for a student to play the role of a teacher is beneficial and something that should be taken advantage of.\n \n In today's day and age, school systems around the country have shown interest towards a summer project. However, merely implementing a summer project is not enough; it is important to take into consideration the benefits of a student-designed project and allow the student to have control over an assignment rather than the teacher. This small step of changing a teacher-based project into a student-based project will result in a large step in the future of education and the success of students.",

      "Since the birth of the internet and social media, the world has shifted to greatly favor the innovators and the free-thinkers. Society no longer demands students to find one subject they are good at, go to college to study that subject, and then get a middle class job in that field. While performing one skill at a very high level still holds value, the most successful people are those who can think ahead of the curve, those who can think of the next Amazon, the next Netflix, the next Uber, the next big thing. So, how does that relate to whether we have student-designed or teacher-designed summer school projects? Well, letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. Instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another.\n \n Allowing students to design their own projects gives them far more freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could. Keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. Each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. That is why we need to give them tailored education. Giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. If we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long termÂ interest in. The freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them.\n \n Making students design their own projects encourages them to learn how to think creatively. Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively.\n \n When forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. For example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to collaborate together to design a project, designate jobs to each other, and hold each other accountable for their share of the work. That kind of collaboration never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. When students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like collaboration, because they won't have someone doing it for them. That is why it is important we take the time to prepare them for than now.\n \n A wise man once said, \"don't follow where the path may lead, but go where there is no path and leave a trail.\" I believe that quote perfectly represents how we want our students to think. The skills developed through out of the box thinking which can be achieved by allowing students the freedom to design their own projects is far more valuable out in the real world then anything the teacher could prepare.Â  Â Â",

Either way these projects stress you out on a break made for not having stress. I will not say they are a good or a bad thing because there are so many pros and cons it'd be hard to really choose. But I guess I have to in order to pass.\n \n To start, I'm going to list some pros and cons of these projects then i'll pick a side. Lets start with pros. Summer projects, if done correctly provide some sort of education during the off school season. But usually when they are designed by teachers. Cons, there are a lot, and I have a student perspective so it makes sense. When a teacher makes the project, it requires me to actually use my brain. Summer projects takes time and energy from me. They take away time from my job that I could be out making money. So that is a pretty big con.\n \n Since I have to choose, If anyone was going to design the summer project it has to be the teacher. They understand the curriculumÂ and how to apply it to students. Yea, it'd be awesome if students did it. Then there would be a lot less work to it. Personally it's hard to think of a reason to where a student would want to design it other than personal benefit. I'm not saying that all students would do that. But a large majority would. Students wouldnt even know where to start. They would make up some fake assignment that would take like 10 minuets to complete. Which is great and all but there would be no information transmitted over the course of the summer.\n \n Honestly how can students design a project on information that they don't fully understand. That would be chaos. I understand why summer projects are in place. But if i'm going to be completely honest here, I don't want some kid designing what my task to do over the summer is. I see two things happening, that person will be my best friend or I'd hate their guts. There is not much more to be said in this argument. Hands down, with out a doubt teachers should design the summer projects.",

      "A student's life should be lived by a student's choice. While there are a select handful of students who yearn to increase their knowledge day in and day out at school, the majority despise it. Due to the lack of free time students are left with after their school day, weekends and breaks are their knights in shining armor that will save them from the prison they call school. One of the breaks most looked foward to is summer break. This three month halt in tests, note taking and projects is sheer paradise in the eyes of students. However, some deem it neccessary to continue the assigned curriculum into this break to ensure the adherence of crucial knowledge to the students' brain. With that being said, these summer projects should be devised in a manner that will benefit both the teacher and the student to the maximum. And so, to assure their continued learning during their break, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed in order to maximize productivity, to enhance their leadership skills and to allow for students to enjoy their project, and hence, giving them a break.\n \n The majority of students innately have a distaste for following directions and taking orders from higher authorities. As a result, when students are constantly ordered to work on numerous projects throughout the year, they will complete it with reluctance. Furthermore, their lack of desire to complete this project will lead to a lack of favorable content, meaning the students will not complete it to the best of their ability. While the teacher may need to put forth guidelines, in order to prevent the students intentionally procrastinating their assignment and turning in mediocre work, the students should be able to partially lead the prompt for the project. When the students are presented with a project they find interesting they will be eager to present their optimal work despite the activities they may be doing during the break.\n \n Taking leadership and making self-guided decisions are skills that students must acquire at an early age in order to succeed later on in life. Although the teacher may portray a leadership role in the classroom, it is quite difficult for the students to replicate the actions they see until they are given the chance. Allowing for students to make the decision on how they will plan their summer project gives them this chance. Simliar to a teacher constructing her lessons, with a student-designed summer project, the students will have to form an agenda based around curriculum and time provided in order to successfully complete it in due time. Ultimately, students will have to make decisions for themselves and organize their daily life giving them an advantage.\n \n Students grow rather lackidasical when dealing with a mundane routine back to back. During the school year, students spend eight to ten months being bombarded by the same tests and the same essay prompts and the same book entries. Summer break, to them, is an escape from all of that pressure. Although it is neccessary to make sure that students retain the information they acquired that year, the students should be able to decide how the reestablishing of ideas and topics they learned. With guidelines and rules given by the teacher, the students can potentially produce work they are proud of and enjoyed working on.\n \n While it may seem rather bizarre to let students decide their own projects, the idea can be fruitful and beneficial for the students and teachers in the end. When the last bell rings for the year released them for summer break, the students bolt out of their school doors and practically forget all that they have learned. In order to prevent that, many teachers have implemented summer projects to assure the continued learning and retainment of their knowledge. However, during the summer when students are on vacation and living in paradise, the last matter they want to worry about is another project assigned by their teacher. Consequently, the students may potentially complete it without care to discard the thought of having work to do. This is ultimately counterintuative to the purpose of said projects. To fix this possible mishap, students should be able to design their projects with guidelines from their teacher so they enjoy the process of completing it while still enjoying their break, ehnace their organization and leadership skills and produce work to the best of their ability, With this method, the students can retain the information deemed neccessary by the teacher and the teacher is able to see this effort and productivity they put into it throughout the school year.",

      "Summer break for most students is a time when they can relax and enjoy a break from school and socialize with friends and family. While it may be in the students best interest to continue learning during the break while not in school, most times students are very reluctant to do their work if there is no in school motivation. If teachers insist on requiring students to complete a project over summer break they may receive better results if the project is student-designed. Having the students pick a teacher-approved topic that they are curious about would make them more interested in learning about their topic, give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.\n \n When students are interested in what they are learning about they pay more attention, and that is very important in the learning process. Letting the student decide what they get to research would not only motivate them, but keep them interested. For example, over the years I myself have been assigned homework over summer break, usually reading, and my classmates and I were much more inclined to complete the homework when the teachers let us choose what books we wanted to read, rather than forcing us to read something we didnt want to. This translates to almost any age of student, if they are given choices, they feel less forced to spend their summer break completing a project, and are more likely to complete the project.\n \n As most students know, homework is not enjoyable most of the time and we procrastinate until the last possible minute to get our schoolwork done, and most of the time when we do this the product is sub par. This is not because of the lack of intelligence, it is because of the lack if interest and effort. When students do not care about the work they are creating they will put very little effort into what they are doing. While if it is something that they are passionate about they will put much more time and effort into what they are doing. Say there is a student who loves to learn about plants and animals and how they live and survive, giving them a project on the Civil War would not interest them, and therefore they would produce a project created with little effort, bare minimum. If this same student was allowed to research plants and animals over the summer, their project would most likelyÂ be something they are proud of not only because of the effort that was put in, but because they would feel accomplished that they learned something new.\n \n When students enjoy learning it makes them more curious about learning new things. When Students are told what to learn and are kept uninterested, they begin to associateÂ learning with boredom. This can be detrimental for the the growth children, if they no longer want to learn. More times then not, when a student feels defeated, or unintelligent they give up, and that discourages them from learning in the future as well. While it is a teachers job to guide and teach the essential information in the curriculum, it is also their job to foster creativity and instill the love for learning within their students. Teaches giving students freedom of choice would not decrease the teachersÂ authority, it would simply give variety, especially during the summer when students are not particularly wanting to learn. A summer project where the student gets to pick their own topic would be a good opportunity to instill within them that learning can be fun and enjoyable.\n \n A teacher-approved Student-designed project over the summer would be the superior choice over a teacher-designed project. This would not only produce better results but produce better retainingÂ of the information that they learned, to be used in the following school year. Overall giving the students control over what they learn during the summer, would still assure that they are learning over their break while also keeping them interested in learning, allowing them to give more effort to the project, and enjoy learning.Â",

      "In my own opinion, as a high school junior at Generic_School; to further your education during the summer, schools should allow student-lead projects to take place. The pros of allowing students to design their own tailored made educational projects out weigh the cons. When you are able to design your own educational project you put more heart into it, then if it was teacher-designed. That extra passion allows for students: to explore different interests, connect with colleges, explore research foundations, and to participate in community service.\n \n Nudged deep in every student thoughts, especially teenagers,Â is the fact that college is right around the corner. Allowing students to use creativity to there advantage, instead of being left in a box doing a research paper. Gives them a positive opportunity to explore different careers and the majors attached to them. Lets say for a thought exercise, that a high school junior named Generic_Name is going to college, but sadly doesn't know what he's interested in. A student led project, gives him the perfect opportunity to pursue different career fields, to find out what excites him. By the time he graduates from high school, Generic_Name already has a generalized idea of what he wants to major in.\n \n Asking questions is essential in helping to find the right college or university. Creating a student-project for the summer, allows students to connect with both research foundations and professors at different colleges; enabling students to network earlier not later. To better explain my thinking behind this, think for a minute that your Generic_Name, and your doing a project on DNA. By contacting college level professors and other professionals in that field, you not only helped yourself by getting an A on your report, but by networking; when your ready to apply to college and the professors already know you, your chances for getting in just doubled. As a bonus when Generic_Name is looking to get a job or internship; by already knowing professionals in the field, he's more than likely to get his desired position.\n \n With passion comes community service, it's a saying I like to say, time to time. It works like an equation: passion plus creative project, equals community service. The more excitement that you have for a project, especially if you thought of it yourself, puts students in an unique position to voluntary get downed into the trenches of learning. When your learning, you often make the community better than how you left it in the summer. For an example, I recently met a young college grad named Generic_Name; he told me that in high school, his history teacher told him that a team of archaeologists needed volunteers to map an old Civil War battlefield. Sadly though he couldn't, because his English teacher over the summer made him write a mandatory research essay on Jane Austen.\n \n All in all, students should be in charge of there own educational projects during the summer. It's like the old saying, you attract more with honey then with vinegar. Connecting it to a real world application, allowing someone to think rather then to be given; encourages someone to use passion, educate themselves, and put there heart into it, rather then sigh. Plus it's the summer, who wants to read a boring book from the eighteen hundreds! Â Â",

      "What can get the best of the students to complete a school project during the summer. It is between teacher-design or student-design. Student-design would be best for the students. In the summer, the students have the time they need for what the need to do on the project. The students need to know how to find a way to do a project on their own. Students have their own way in learning, which is the reason why student-design is best for students.\n \n The summer is the best time for a project, especially student-design. Students need their own time to figure out what they need to do to for the project. Some students already know what the can do but, other students have hard time finding their own way or doing the project. The time they need to complete everything is the whole summer and, there isn't school in the summer, excluding summer school. student-design gives students the time to really put what they've learn in the summer\n \n Students-design allows students to open their mind and find a way how they want to do the project. people learn things as they do something. It can apply to here as well, students can learn what they are doing and use their learning to see how things are able to do what they do. Same with finding what type of project in the Student-design, students can evaluate their own life and anything can pop in your head to find a design or anything else. Life isn't easy but, student-design make students decide on their own how they are going to do the project.\n \n Once again, all students are different in everything, even if its similar, its still not the exact same. What iÂ amÂ saying is students can surprise people if doing student-design because who knows what they find out the can possibly help them i the future. Yeah teacher-design can help the students a little more but, creativity and learning the way yourself is a great accomplishment and can possibly help in the next project you do after th summer. people that become successful are the ones who believe in their own work and the students should use their own work for not only for school, but for the anything in life.\n \n Student-design for the students would best help the students be more wise on any work. the creativity can best help out in not only in school, but anywhere they go just because of one project. This project can help tell what students need to work on for the next school year that comes around. The student-design help know who is where and what is needed for after they finish school.",

    essay:
      "Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Since a lot of schools do require a summer project for students so they will have some type of work to do over the summer, it is much better for the teacher to create the summer project. Teachers are trained to give work they know is somewhat suitable for the students. For that reason projects should be teachers designed because they know what type of work to give their students, they usually would not assign something outlandish, they also would not make it as easy as the students will make it be.\n \n Some may argue that students will challenge themselves and not make it easy. People may also say that some teachers assign are a little outlandish and could be very hard for them. some may also say that students have a lot of things to do over the summer like jobs and sports and maybe even both. But not every student has those responsibilities and the others who do should find a little bit of time for their projects. Next, a reason for why teachers should design projects are because teachers know what type of project to design for the students\n \n First reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers know what type of project to assign. Reason for that is because teachers most likely having been assigning projects for years know what type of projects may be to hard or maybe to easy for some students. Most teachers by the time it teachers summer will have a good understanding of what some students can do and can not do, and they know if they should make it challenging or make it somewhat easy. Teachers will try their best to not make the projects too hard for the students to complete for example a teacher would not tell their students to read like say ten books and then summarize them, reason being is because they know not every student has the time to complete it if they have other things going on in their lives. Secondly, teachers wold not assign something that seemed very outlandish or bizarre.\n \n Secondly, teachers would not assign a project that was outlandish and bizarre. Like for example a teacher would not tell you to writeÂ 5 full essays in MLA style have it hand written and also typed. Reason for that is because even though summer may seem long it can actually go by very quickly and many students have things to do over that period of time. For example a student may have a sport that has practice everyday or may have a job that requires them to work everyday. With that in mind teachers would make it challenging but will try to not make the projects very outlandish. Another reason for why teachers would not assign a bizarre project could also be that not all teachers want to grade a lot of papers. For example if they were to assign something like a few essays and a reading project all the grading they would have to do is much greater than the work the students had to do, just because their are a lot of students who may have done the work. In addition to teachers making the projects outlandish and bizarre they would also not make the project as easy as the students might make them.\n \n Lastly summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would not make the projects as easy as the students may make them. Students usually like to not do anything over summer because they think of it as their break from work and projects, so if the school allowed the students to make them the students might make it very easy so they do not have to do much. Students would take advantage of them being able to make their own projects for example, students may make a a easy project like read a comic book or something like that and not do that much. The teacher however will make it somewhat challenging like for example they will assign a project that would not be very easy but will make it somewhat hard. Not all students will make it easy their are some students who will challenge themselves to do good and make a good project. But it would be better and more efficient if the teacher were to design it. Lastly, in all it would be more efficient if the teacher were to design the summer project\n \n In conclusion teachers should design the summer reading project because they know what to assign to their students, they not gonna make it outlandish or bizarre, they are also not gonna make it as easy as the students might make it. Teachers get paid to each students so it would make sense if the teachers would assign the summer projects because they know what type of assignments to give for the students. After all of this is done i want you to,look back and realize why teacher should make the summer projects and why students should not be able to. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "As students are furthering their education, teachers are assigning summer assignments in order to prepare them for their upcoming class. Many believe these summer assignments should be student designed due to students' convenience, nevertheless, these summer assignments should be teacher designed because it ensures that students are prepared for the class, exposes them to new material outside of their comfort zone, and keeps students' busy throughout the break.\n \n Before the school year ends, teachers take time out of their work day to produce a summer assignment for their students' next school year. Having teacher designed summer assignments help ensure that students are ready for the content in their upcoming year. Students are unable to know their struggles with next years content until they are actually in that class. Teachers are able to look at their lower scoring topics of the year and put a couple questions of that topic onto the summer assignment. By doing this, it will help the students learn from the past students' struggle topics. Because of the summer assignment, students are able to get a boost and learn quicker when they are being taught in class. An example of this happened during a student's sophomore year while picking their junior year classes. This particular student had to choose between academic biology or honors biology; they were unsure of which class they wanted to take. The student eventually choose honors biology in the end; she found out that about the summer assignment due the first week of classes. She struggled with converting units and was nervous the topic would be a struggle in the class. Her teacher assured her that it was normal to struggle as many other students struggled with that as well. She complained on and on until she came into class that next year and excelled due to the summer assignment she completed. If the student had designed her own summer assignment, she would not have excelled as well as she did because of the teacher designed summer assignment.\n \n As teachers are designing their own summer assignment for their class, they put new material that the students have never been exposed to. While many express how having student designed summer assignments give students more freedom; they don't realize how most students will not go outside of their comfort zone to learn new material. If the students were to design their own summer assignment, all of the material will be information that they already knew or are most comfortable with. Teacher designed summer assignments will give a chance for the student to push themselves out of their comfort zone to learn new information that will ultimately help them with their next school year. For example, the summer before junior year, an AP Language and Composition teacher gave students an assignment that included reading or watching 15 sources. These 15 sources had to be stretched out from 5 different categories: current events, history, politics, entertainment, and documentaries. The students were forced out of their comfort zone by their teacher having their students exposed to all of the different categories. Because of the exposure, the students are aware of information they would not have known if they didn't complete the assignment. When given the chance, students will stay in their own comfort zone; which the teachers can break when there are teacher designed summer assignments.\n \n When the teachers are trying to break students' comfort zones with the summer assignments, it gives the students a chance to think outside of the box and spend more time trying to interpret the new information. For most students, summer break is filled with eating and watching TV on their couch; if the students were given the chance to design their own assignment for the break, they would put easy information for them to complete in order for them to have more time to spend on the couch eating chips. The students would come back with their minds still tangled up with the TV and couch; if teachers were to design the assignment, the teachers would put information that they know would keep the students' minds busy and working throughout the summer. This makes it easier for students to ease back into school; rather than them still being in summer mode 3 months into the school year.\n \n Being eased back into the school year is a thing many students struggle with. It can be fixed by having teacher designed summer assignments. It is time for all teachers to regulate teacher designed summer assignments in order to make the school year easier for all students. While many students will complain about the workload, it will pay off later when they realize the summer assignment helped them with the content of the class. They will also be interested in new topics because of the teachers input in the summer assignment to push them outside of their comfort zone.

    essay:
      "A student's freedom from the limitations of the classroom's necessary rules during the summer provides new opportunities for them to learn in dynamic ways. While, in the classroom, a teacher's control of a regulated learning program is unavoidable in order to teach such a broad audience in such a short time, there are no such factors outside the classroom. The variable shape of a student's summer project provides a unique opportunity for the student's specific educational needs to be accounted for - which a teacher-designed project wouldn't be able to take advantage of. Education during the summer should be student-designed, because the student can pander to their learning style and interest, it can reinvigorate the student with a passion for learning, and it instills a certain independence from adult figures that will be necessary later in life.\n \n Students learn in many different ways. Psychological studies have shown that there are different types of learning, from spacial to audio to visual, and students learn better in some ways than others. A rising awareness of mental health has also led to the understanding that brains process information in different ways, so students with autism or ADHD don't get the same results from the conventional classroom practices. Student-designed summer projects would be able to take all these different specifications into account when structuring the project, so visual learners could visit exhibitions while attention deficient kids could apply whatever technique they need to help them study (listening to music for some, a totally still room for others). The dynamicÂ nature of a student-designed project would be an advantage to the kids who need to learn in a different way from the regulated, cookie-cutter methods that teachers use. As well, a student-designed project could angle more in the direction of what the student wants to learn about. Students are forced to spend hours of a day paying attention to subject matters that they don't care for in order to get a generalized education. However, the point of a summer project is education itself, not education towards the goal of a degree. Students would be able to design a project that deepens their interest in a topic, broadens their knowledge in a niche industry. Education would feel more like a hobby than a chore if a student could account for what they learn and how they want to learn it.\n \n A student-designed summer project would be exciting for students, because the agency over their education would allow them to create highly specified and perfect learning courses for themselves. Going through a program that teaches them in a way that they both understand and enjoy would be exciting and possibly life changing. The modern school system is the most monstrous source of stress on the childhood and adolescent mind. Even though learning should be acknowledged as a privilege, wonder, and necessity, it becomes a burden to students. Between the forced socialization of the classroom environment, administrations that care more for policy than the experience of the individual, a constantly building workload, and a set of rules and grades that are constantly judging and disciplining behavior, schooling becomes nightmarish for students. The poor environment weighs so heavily on the minds of children that they often develop mental illnesses or complexes, and, in extreme cases, are driven to suicide over poor grades (which, in the grand scheme of life, should be menial). Student-designed summer projects would be a way to show students that learning can be a growing and nurturing experience, instead of a murderous one. That change in outlook in the mind of a student could make all the difference in that student's optimism, well being, and quality of life for the rest of their schooling career.\n \n One of the main focuses of school is to prepare a student for adulthood. While school accomplishes that in many ways, it fails to teach students how to truly act independently, because their lives are always in some way being influenced by adults that hold real power. A student-designed summer project would fill this void of education, however, because it encourages students to make choices for themselves and then to carry through with those choices in order to make them a reality. Placing the responsibility of their own education on a student would encourage them to think critically and organizationally in order to create and then implement a strategy. The limitless possibilities of the project, because the design is given over to the student, would teach them how to narrow down vague concepts into specific plans. Even arranging for certain resources to be supplied, depending on the project, would show the student how to control moving parts - whether that manifests in asking their mother to buy eggs from the grocery store or in biking to the library to check out the necessary reading materials. Students are rarely prepared for the autonomy of college and the time-managing aspects of adulthood, because they're used to their parents or teachers doing things for them. Forcing a student to design a project that they then have to complete would be an introduction into the decision making of adulthood.\n \n A student-designed summer project would help students grow, because they could change their views on the operations of education in the span of a few months. They would grow to be stronger learners, more persistent observers, and more assertive leaders. Since life is really a process of learning--whether that means learning skills, academics, or something else entirely--an easy relationship with the concept of learning is the most valuable thing for a person to develop. Student-designed projects are an easy opportunity to encourage and teach that kind of relationship, and students would develop an outlook on learning that would improve the way they interact with the world for the rest of their lives.Â",

      "Summer projects are a helpful tool to use to gain insight of a student's capabilities and to prepare them for the upcoming school year. Summer projects can be used for any subject or curriculum to help a student for their next courses, whether they are college level or not. Even though summer projects are designed to help students and can be done in a number of ways, it is beneficial to have it designed based on the teacher's curriculum and needs.\n \n Though there are different varieties of how to formulate a summer assignment, having it expand on student skills and help teach a new subject can be beneficial for the teacher. Summer assignments can be used as a review and to help teach a new subject based on what the course is. Having it designed around the teacher's curriculum and upcoming plans allows for students to get a grasp and to expect what will be taught and the level of difficulty the class will be. For example, summer assignments for math tend to review previous subjects that will be used for a harder math course and will help expand on this knowledge. A summer assignment that I have done is one for Precalculus with Trigonometry that not only reviewed previous math skills but expanded on them which helped to prepare me for the course. Students have voiced that these projects are too hard and can never finish them in time. That is why assignments are given at the beginning of summer to allow exponential time to do them and are made in a way to teach and prepare students for what they will learn in a harder course, making an easier assignment will not be beneficial for these reasons. Summer projects can be made with different variations, having them based on a teacher's plans allows for an preparedness and an expansion of skills.\n \n Summer projects are a beneficial tool for all students and teachers, though it is helpful for a teacher in the new year to teach the subject if students have some knowledge about it. Students tend to struggle when going into a new year, especially with classes that are college leveled and they have no knowledge about it or what they may be getting into. For an AP class, it can be useful for a student to complete an assignment and have some indication of what the teacher's curriculum is and be able to prepare for the class or even drop if they feel like they may fail it. I am in college weighted class now, and if it wasn't for the summer project, I can say I could have possible failed the class if it wasn't based on the teacher's curriculum and I could've been entirely loss in the class. Students may say that a summer assignment should be fun and they should be able to pick what to do, but a student picking the assignment will not be beneficial for the teacher, it can cause a teacher to redo their year plans and may be behind on teaching and preparing a student for an upcoming exam. Though students can pick if what and if they want to do the summer project, the assignments being based on the teacher's future teaching plans will allow the student to know upcoming expectations.\n \n Summer projects are a tool to help a teacher, having them designed around the teacher's plans will allow each teacher to know where each student is and know where to focus most in the curriculum. Every student had different previous teachers who teach in different ways and have different capabilities and extensions of learning which can cause a struggle for teachers. For example, my English summer project was to read and annotate a novel so I could write an argumentative essay on it. After turning it in, it became clear to my AP Language Arts teacher that not every student was on the same skill level for writing and that she would have to reteach the basis of writing for different formats of essays; without the summer project she would not have know this. Summer reading assignments should allow a student to choose the book so they will want to read and get the assignment done. Having this choice, students may pick a book that is not on their skill level and can hurt them when doing assignments in the class. It will ruin teacher plans on what each unit will be and what will beÂ taught in said units. Though students are mature enough to choose their assignments and parts for the projects, teachers design them to know more about each student and will be prepared to reevaluate their lesson plans.\n \n Summer assignments come in a variety of ways, but having them based on the teacher's units and plans for the school year will prepare both student and teacher. Summer projects can be used in any subject to benefit the teacher and allow a smooth year for easier teaching when knowing the students skill set and be prepared to change plans to accommodate these. As a student continues to move up the grades and start taking college leveledÂ classes, it is imperative to have some incoming knowledge of the subject and to expand on previous skills. Summer projects can either be student designed or teacher designed, but in the end a student ill benefit only if the assignment is based on the teacher.",

    essay:
      "Do you really think student's would like to complete summer projects over the summer? Me personally i would hate to even think about having some type of extra work in the summer, why? well here are my three reasons. I know sometimes in the summer, were bored and can't wait to start school. Secondly there's times where we want summer to hurry up and come around, because were drained mentally, physically, and emotionally because of the thought, we have work to finish up, make sure you turn it in on time before the due date and focus on maintaining to keep your grades looking good and not disappointing,. Thirdly, no teacher nor student would like to do a summer project over the summer.\n \n Although, in the summer, were sometimes bored and can't wait to see are friends so were excited for school to start back up and hang out with are fellow peers. Because i know some people can't go out, hang out with friends because their parents are too stricked; or they're furious about letting their kids out at a certain time even though they can have a bed time but some parent's just can't risk anything i'm talking out of experience because my parent's are like that, it's not fun at all. But honestly you'll thank them later on as you get older or when you have kids because, how society now days is set up is crazy! , i tell you.\n \n Then, we started school, for example \"September 4, 2019\" is the first day we enrolled in school then give it a few months into the school year \"January 11, 2020\". let me tell you, the first day of school was memorable, seeing the pleasant faces of missed friends and teachers was probably the best, but as soon you get later into the year it's not so jolly anymore, your're DRAINED the feeling that you just want to drop out, give up, you dress like you don't love yourself because of the amount of stress on school work, the end of year state test's, so you can't help but to say \"I can't wait for summer\" out of your mouth. You feel so relived when the word \"summer\" comes out, you start thinking about all the things you can't wait to do.\n \n After, when you are finished with school, who wants to go home and wants to start on a summer project?? most defiantly not the teachers nor the students, we have been learning for months and i know teachers are sick, tired and cant wait to catch a break, don't get me wrong we need to gain knowledge everyday but after all the months we've been learning and teachers staying after to grade our papers and assign are next assignment when we come in class is a call, a call that we need a break.\n \n To sum it all up. The moral of the story is no, no i don't think teacher's nor student's should be required to complete a summer project over the summer, it's too much for them and i'mÂ pretty sure their brain needs some type of break, you know? vise verse. I hope the schools that require this assignment should think about there decisionÂ a little more. Respectfully. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "The Sun is blazing, the sky is blue, and school is out. What more do students want? Once summer starts school books are thrown to the back of the closet, never to be seen until the next year. This worries schools since when students aren't learning during the summer then classes have to be provided for students to relearn everything they forgot. This led schools to develop summer projects so that their students will learn during the summer. However, issues started to arise of how they should be designed. Some say teachers should design it and others say that students should design it. Although teacher-designed summer projects would help set guidelines so that the students can learn as much as they can, student-designed projects will let the students showcases their creativity.\n \n When designing the summer projects, teachers most definitely would set guidelines for students to help them, when they get stuck. However, what teachers don't realize is that by setting guidelines they are really restricting the student's creativity. They are limiting what the students can do and for the students to get a good grade on the projects, they would base their entire project on those guidelines. Which would mean they aren't really learning. These set guidelines would correspond with the topics that the teacher assigns. The assigned topics would focus on the materials the students need the most help in. Which in reality is forcing the students to learn. When someone is forced to do something they aren't interested in doing, they wouldn't usually put their full effort in to completing that task. This is the same for students too. By forcing the students to do these projects and not letting them chose what topic to do, the students wouldn't put all their effort in the project. This represents that the students aren't actually learning. This would be theÂ oppositeÂ effect of what the summer projects were intended to do.\n \n If the students were to, however,Â design the projects instead, then the issue of them not learning would be avoided. By making the students design their own projects, they are able to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills. Most students, during school, have a difficult time demonstrating what creativity they have. However, by giving them this chance to design their own projects the students can really put their full heart into it since they would actually have interest in the topic. By being able to design their own projects students can also develop new skills, like leadership. Leadership is when someone is able to take charge in a difficult situation. The students would be able to represent this when they have to take charge to develop their own project based off the topic they chose. Having the ability to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills, students would be able to fully grasp what their learning. Schools then wouldn't have to worry about assigning classes so the students can relearn everything they forgot, since when school starts in the fall students would be ready to tackle new topics.\n \n When it comes to demonstrating why students should design their own projects, schools should look towards the science fair. The science fair is a student-designed project that every student has to do, at least once, in their high school or middle school life. The science fair makes students pick a topic that their experiment would be based off of. When picking the topic, the student is showcasing their creative side since they aren't restricted on what topic to pick. During the experiment process, students are able to develop research skills for when they have to write their background paper on their hypothesis. Since they would need to find respectedÂ articles that relate to theirÂ hypothesis.Â Students would also be developing their leadership skills since when doing their experiment things can go wrong and they have to take charge and figure out why. At the end of the science fair process, students can then really grasp the understanding of the scientific design process and how to develop a well done experiment. This would all be possible since the science fair is a student designed project. If the teacher were to design the project and pick the topics, students would have never been able to fully understand the scientific design process.\n \n Schools should make the summer projects student-designed since it allows students to showcase their creative side. Even if having them teacher-designed would help set guidelines the students can look back at when stuck. By having teachers design the projects, students are going to be restricted and aren't going to be able to really learn since they won't be putting all their effort into the project. This would all be avoided if students were to design the projects themselves, because they won't be restricted and instead they would put all their effort into the project. At the end, students would be developing new skills and getting to actually learn. A perfect example is the science fair, where students are made to design their own experiments so that they can understand the scientific design process and how to properly make a experiment. Schools should trust their own students for their own learning at certain times.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects range from all sorts of different styles and designs. Some people argue that these assignments should be teacher-designed so it is more detailed and challenging. Others argue that it should be student-designed so its better for the student. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it, students will be more passionate about it, and teacher-designed projects take away freedom.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it. People learn better when they do things themselves. If students have the ability to choose how to do their project, then they can learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn which makes student-designed projects the best way to learn. Furthermore, its helps students overcome obstacles. When students are doing their projects they will run into troubles. If the project is student-designed, they will have to overcome these obstacles themselves and help them grow academically. To sum it up, student-designed projects help students learn from mistakes and help them overcome obstacles.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be more passionate about it. Students will do their project if they can choose what its on. If students can choose the subject of the project they will be more likely to do it because they are interested in what it is about. If the project is something they do not care about, they will not complete the assignment. Students will have more fun doing the project. If students can choose the subject of the project they will likely choose something they are interested in. If the subject of the project is something the student enjoys, they will have a great time doing it. To sum it up, student-designed projects will encourage students to complete the assignments and students will have a good time doing it.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because teacher-designed projects takes away a student's freedom. Teacher's get to choose everything. Teacher's get to choose what assignments students receive throughout the whole school year. Students should get the chance to be free and choose what they want. Furthermore, Students should get the choice of how the project gets done. Students have to take time out of their vacation to complete their summer project. Since they're using their own time, they should at least get to decide how to do their project. To sum it up, student-designed projects give students the freedom to learn what they want to learn.\n \n Student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects because they help students learn better by making them overcome obstacles. Students are also more passionate about it and it gives them the freedom to do what they want. Students don't get the chance to choose many things, but summer projects should be something they get to complete the way they want.",

    essay:
      "Summer break is the declaration of emancipation that sets students free from the abyss of school. The simple thought of summer elicits euphoria: late night movie marathons, hanging out with friends during weekdays, and sleeping in without having to worry about homework or exams. Nevertheless, there is one thing that keeps students' desks occupied during this relaxing break: summer projects. The disappointment of summer assignments is universal; I experienced this unpleasant disruption of paradise in both Korea and the United States. Having to complete projects during summer is stressful and time consuming--time that could be spent having fun with friends and family. Making summer projects student-designed rather than teacher-designed would therefore enable students to use their imaginations to implement and store their knowledge in a creative way, experiment with interests and passions, and enjoy their break stress-free while promoting their intrinsic motivation at the same time.\n \n The entire school year is based on teacher-designed learning systems. Students complete worksheets and tests created by teachers, and projects itself are also designed by teachers--students are expected to follow a specific rubric with which they are graded based on. This rigid, inflexible system of learning prohibits students from expressing their creativity in fear of getting a bad grade. Thus, summer break should be preserved as a time for students to use their own imagination and creativity to complete a project that would help them maintain what they learned during the school year. For example, a student-designed summer project for a science class would encourage a student's thinking as they would be given the freedom to choose any topic that strike their interest to experiment or research on. On the other hand, a teacher-designed science project would simply be filling out packets of worksheets from academic readings. I have experience with the latter teacher-designed project from my sophomore year of high school. For my AP Biology class, I was given summer homework for which I had to read a biology textbook and complete worksheets. Looking back, I can say that the hours of reading were not helpful to my overall success in the course because I would fill the blanks without really understanding the information, or simply copy off of my friends.\n \n In addition to providing an opportunity for use of creativity, summer is the perfect time to experiment with your interests and learn new skills. During school, students are so focused on studying to get good grades that they do not have the time to take a second and consider what their passion is. The long summer breaks are the once-a-year chance for students to explore and discover interests. To take my experience for example, my 6th grade summer homework in Korea was to complete tasks related to music and science--no specific guidelines or rubrics provided. That summer, I went to a music camp for a month where I practiced orchestral music with fellow musicians. For the science portion, I learned how to fix a leaking toilet, install new lights on the ceiling, and change the filter of a water fountain connected to a bathroom from my dad. Not only did these tasks complete my summer project, it was beneficial to me as I developed a passion for music and also learned valuable life skills.\n \n Above all the benefits of summer break, the number one reason why students look forward to summer is probably because of the relief of stress. Summer is a time of break from school. During summer, students spend time with friends and family to enjoy the long break before entering the stressful school year. However, the amount of summer projects given, exclusively teacher-designed, seems to negatively correlate with the amount of stress relieved during summer from the school year. If students were allowed to create their own projects, they would be less stressed as opposed to when teachers assign them projects with strict requirements no different from the standard school work. For example, rather than English teachers assigning a list of books for students to read and annotate, allowing students to choose their own books would encourage many to actually complete the task. Having the freedom to choose their own book would be appealing as they would not be restricted to the expectations of school courses. This would help to moderate the stress from the project and instead provide intrinsicÂ motivation for the students to continue learning over the summer.\n \n A good solution for students' hatred toward summer assignments is enabling them to create their own project. Not only do student-designed projects promote creativity and high-level thinking, they also allow students to explore their interests and acquire new abilities. Moreover, having the freedom to choose their own projects lessens the stress of having to take the time out of their break to complete an assignment as well as strengthening their intrinsic motivation.",

      "Spring break is lots of fun for students that are in school. Students get one or more weeks of school off to do what they want to do. During spring break there still should be some learning going on in the students spring break. Whether that be essays, projects, or book reading, students should be doing work through break. Some schools require students to complete projects during spring break week. Students should design the project that kid wants to do so they can remember it better and learn from what that student is saying and doing in that specific subject.\n \n First, students would benefit more from making their own projects from scratch. So many kids can not always comprehend what the teacher is teaching them so the kids try an put the knowledge into his or her own words. Teachers should not be responsible for how the students do the projects. Kids and teens that are in school can retain more information when him or her are doing the project based on what they think is right. Also, the students should be able to choose what the project that student is going to do because, the students are more likely to agree, be able to compare with that project, feel more connected with it, and interested.\n \n Second, learning during break is a good thing for students to do for themselves without the teacher present. If the kids put his or her own effort into doing a project without the teachers outlines, the students will be way more successful in learning and retaining the information those students have just done in the project. In some cases, having a student make up his or her own projects is a gigantic help to the grade and to the teachers. Students would benefit more from making the project something that student loves to do or a special hobby that kid has.\n \n Some may say that, a teacher designed project is better for the students. Students would be able to go back and reference what is supposed to be on the project that the teacher has given that person. However, student designed projects are better for the class. The kids will be willing and able to do a project thatÂ him or her want and desire to do.\n \n In conclusion, kids should design the project so that him or her can remember what that student is learning in class. Some students have a hard time grasping what the teacher is teaching them. The kids tend to learn more and pay more attention at home or somewhere other then school. Projects over spring break should be student designed.Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.\n \n Completing a summer project allows students to refocus more quickly when school starts again and ensures that skills students learned during the previous school year remain sharp.\n \n Additionally, the completion of a summer project provides for a phantasmagoria of success throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n However, most of these summer projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students learn differently, can explore their passion, and can show off their unique skill set.\n \n Obviously, students have different learning abilities and may learn differently from their peers.\n \n For example, students who are classified as auditory learners would not succeed on a hands-on project to continue their education because they prefer verbal explanations or videos to learn.\n \n Additionally, some students are visual learners; they may require to see another person's work in order to complete their own.\n \n Therefore, assigning these students a hands-on project would not be beneficial to their education.\n \n When different learning styles are taken into consideration, it is evident that each individual student is aware of how they learn; consequently, they should be able to devise a project that fits their unique learning style.\n \n Furthermore, assigning a student a project that does not interest them would make completing the project seemingly unbearable.\n \n Students would choose topics that interest them if given the chance to design their own project.\n \n For example, a student who is particularly interested in automobiles would not wish to complete a project on the effects of cow manure on the pollution of waterways.\n \n They, in turn, would not take this project seriously, which would be detrimental to their grade.\n \n Additionally, giving students the opportunity to design their own project would allow the teacher to see each student's passions.\n \n This would benefit both teacher and student because the teacher would learn about the student's interests on the first day of school rather than through awkward \"getting to know you\" activities.\n \n Giving students the ability to design their own projects would allow each student to be excited to explore their interests and present their passions to the classroom when school starts again.\n \n Some would say that allowing the students to design their own projects would cause an issue for the teacher to grade it because each student's project would be different.\n \n However, allowing students to design their own project would give them the ability to show off their specific set of skills.\n \n For example, students who are gifted in vocal music would not succeed on a project that involves woodworking, and vice versa.\n \n Students should be given the opportunity to share their gifts with the teacher so that future projects could be set to their strengths rather than their weaknesses.\n \n On the issue of grading these projects, teachers could evaluate the amount of time and effort that appears to be put into each project rather than using a cookie-cutter rubric.\n \n Students would be more successful on a project that showcases their skills than if a teacher designed the project for them.\n \n Grading these projects would simply take a more evaluative angle from the teacher.\n \n When one considers that students have individual learning needs, wish to complete projects based on their passions, and are more successful completing projects that emphasize their skill set, then one can see that students should be able to design their own summer project rather than complete one that is teacher-designed.\n \n Allowing students to design their own summer project would, consequently, prepare and excite them for the upcoming school year where they would be able to present findings that are unique.\n \n This would then build momentum for the remainder of the school year.\n \n Although projects would prove to be dampening to the students' summer break, completing a project that explores their interests would be less gruesome than a teacher-designed project.Â",

      "Summer break is for students to have fun and enjoy the long warm days, however, school requires for students to continue learning. The way they want you to continue your learning is by making projects. Schools want to know if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed.\n \n In my opinion if students are going to be required to make these projects they should at least be able to be student-designed. Since it's summer, students are not going to be pleased having to make a project espescially if its teacher-designed. If students were allowed to make the project their own way they would be able to make anything that involves what is going on with their summer break. They would have also more options and ideas than if the projects were to be teacher designed. Student's would have a greater chance doing extremely better if they went based on their own creatation.\n \n Students would maybe struggle a little because then again they are only students, so they wouldn't know if they did it right or if they have enough work done. If it were to be teacher-designed, student would have an idea of how much they would need to include. It would take longer but a student would know what the teacher is looking for and what they would consider a good grade. As a student myself i overthink a lot on the work i do on my own; i ask myself \" does this look right or is it missing something?\". Which leads me to try and making it better.\n \n Overall, i would prefer if the school would allow the projects to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. It would take less time if students had the choice to have our project made the way they think is best. Students work faster when given something to do on their own because it opens their mind up to more than one thing. Since the project is a requirement i feel as if it should be fun and made however students feel is right, this way they spend more timing doing it and getting the work done.\n \n In conclusion, students should be allowed to have the choice to make their summer project just the way they feel is right. Teacher-designed projects don't let a students be as creative as if they made it with their own ideas.",

      "Summer assignments are known to and disliked by every students that has had to complete these tedious tasks. Schools assign summer projects to assure that their students are still learning during their breaks. However, as you grow up the tasks that are assigned tend to shift from something that is teacher-designed to student-designed. Some people may say that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial to a students learning, because teachers know the material that should be learned and these project are easier to understand.Â However, they are wrong because student-designed projects have a lot more benefits that are necessary to a students learning and growth. Summer projects should be student-designed because they ensure that the subject of the assignment is relevant and interesting to the student and they teach them important skills.\n \n To begin, student-designed projects let students pick subjects that are most likely to benefit them. Teachers dont know what field every student wants to study in, and so they cant make a project that will be beneficial to everyone. For example, the most common summer assignment is to read a book and then write an essay on what the student has learned, which helps kids in their reading and writing skills. However if a student wanted be a scientist, although this project would be somewhat useful, it wouldnt help them get closer to achieving their goals and dreams. On the other hand if the project would have been student-designed the future scientist could have chosen to conduct experiments or learn more about what interests them. Also, student-designed projects motivate kids to continue learning and so they wont lose interest. When a student picks their own assignment, they will be more likely to finish it and more than that they will actually want to finish the project. An example of this in a different context from my daily life is myself doing some cleaning. If my parents told me to clean, i will most likely put it off or do a sloppy job, because i didn't want to do it in the first place and at that point i am being pressured and forced to do the chore, but if i chose to do it on my own terms everything would get done in an orderly fashion. I feel like students use a similar mindset for completing project. If it was student-designed, they would be motivated to keep working and in the end they would produce better work. Some people may say that teacher-designed projects are better because, they focus on material that students should know for every career option, but they are wrong because what is important to learn in one field might not be as important to learn if they chose to pursue a job in another field.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects teach students very important life skills. It teaches them to be self-reliant. They have to come up with their own project and set out their own rules and criteria. They cant look back at the instructions and follow what the teacher said, and they cant ask specific question about how to do the project, because everyone has a different project specific to themselves. This type of project makes it necessary to think on their own and not get help or take short cuts from others. Learning how to problem solve and understand things on your own is something that will be crucial as an adult so it best to learn it at a young age. Also, self-projects help you stay organized. When you are doing something completely on your own, with your own ideas you cant lose or forget things because it is detrimental to your project. Unlike something that is assigned where you can just look back on the website or check the paper to find the answers, you have to keep track of everything yourself or else you wont have the answers. Lastly, student-designed projects help with time-management. During my personal project, since i had trips and activities planned during the summer, i had to set out a specific time lineÂ with goals that i wanted to have complete by each week. Before this project, I was very bad at completing tasks because i would always put it off until it was the very last minute. With this project, i was forced to do everything in a process or else i would fall behind. Students would not learn all these skills if everything was laid out by a teacher in a teacher-designed project.\n \n Although teacher-designed projects are easier to understand and the teacher know what material is important, student-designed projects are a lot more beneficial to every individual student. Having a student design their own summer project ensures that what they are choosing to learn is beneficial and interesting to them. It also teaches students life skills that are important for everyone to learn at a young age. The point of summer assignments are to keep the student learning even when they are out of school. I think if the main goal of the school was to have students just learn information during the summer, then a teach-designed project would be acceptable.

    essay:
      "In today's world, the competition for higher education is ever increasing, with the requirements for test scores, GPA, and extracurricularsÂ growing exponentially each year. To help keep up with the competition and separate students from the general masses, some schools are beginning to require summer projects to ensure students are continuing to learn, even when out of school. While this practice is becoming more and more common, many schools are struggling to decide whether these projects should be assigned by the teacher or created by the students. Although some say that teachers should assign summer projects because they will be more suited to helping students learn, summer assignments should be student-designed because they will excite students to learn, be better suited for the students' lives, and encourage creativity.\n \n First, student-designed projects are superior because they inspire and excite students. In a learning environment, passion and excitement are paramount to student success. Often times when teachers assign projects and assignments, they have little regard for the interests of the students, causing the class to dread working on the assignment and putting it off until the last moment. Also, when students choose their own project, they can ensure they are relevant for their future plans. For example, if a student wanted to become a banker in the future, they could base their project around the world of economics instead of wasting their time on a project about the Civil War. All in all, student-designed projects would encourage success because students would be more invested in completing the projects and they would help them in their future careers.\n \n Additionally, student-designed projects benefit students because they are better suited for students' lives. In any given high school, there are students who live drastically different lives, from students who have to work two jobs to teens who have nothing but free time after school. Because of this vast diversity, not all students reap the same benefits from a teacher-designed project. If students were able to design their projects, they would create projects that work best with their schedule and do not cause any undue stress. In addition, some projects are not economically feasible for all students. As an example, if there was a teacher-designed project that required all students to build a robot out of costly circuit boards and 3-D printed materials, not all students would be able to afford the materials, causing them to take short cuts and hurt their grade. Student-designed projects would ensure that students can design an assignment that fits their budget and would help to close the disparity in success between wealthy and working class students. To conclude, student-designed projects benefit students because they ensure that the assignments fit in with students' busy schedules and tight budgets.\n \n Finally, student-designed projects help ensure out-of-school learning by helping to spur student creativity. When students are assigned a project by a teacher there is little abstract thought needed to complete the project, all they have to do is follow the teacher's directives and they will get an acceptable grade. When students create their own projects, however, they are forced to think deeply throughout the entire process, from formulating the topic to deciding upon the presentation methods. Also, student-created projects encourage creativity because it opens the door for the study of more abstract topics instead of the mundane, ordinary topics that teachers usually dwell on. For example, music is shown to increase creative thinking, so if a student wanted to learn about the French Revolution, they could create a topic like, \"The French Revolution and its effects on the Romantic music of the day,\" instead of an ordinary topic like, \"The effects of the French Revolution.\" In summary, student-created projects encourage learning by requiring students to use their creativity.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer assignments help students learn because they interest students, fit students' lives, and inspire creativity among teens. If schools began to implement student-designed summer projects, they would begin to see an increase in passion and preparedness come August when students go back to school. As a result of the increased drive shown by students, schools will also begin to see more and more students attending accredited, well-respected universities upon graduation. Schools must start allowing students to design their students to design summer projects, for it will create an educated, passionate, and happy school community.",

    essay:
      "Many students and teachers argue over the question of whether or not students should be able to design their own summer break projects. There are mixed answers over the quality of the work, the amount of creativity that should be allowed in the school building, and how well this ensures students learn the material. Teacher led projects, however, take away all of the potential positive effects associated with those concerns. Summer projects should be student designed to increase creativity in students, make sure students know their classroom material well, and increase the quality and student interest of these projects.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity in students. When a teacher designs a project, it takes away the opportunity for the student to design and create their own representation of the assignment. When students get to choose their methodology of presentation, there are often more creative outcomes. For example, in an AP Government class at Generic_School, the students were given the opportunity to create a project on one of the departments of Congress. This led to numerous different types of projects: songs, raps, creative videos, etc. Had the teacher mandated they all do a PowerPoint (or other mode of presentation), the students would not have had nearly as much fun or been as informative in their projects. School should be about learning, but there should also be an element of creativity and expressing oneself in the classroom. Letting students design their own projects leads to much more creativity and student interest in the classroom.\n \n An additional reason that summer projects should be student designed are to ensure student comprehension of the topic. When a student has to generate their own mode of presentation, this ensures that they fully understand the classroom material, because the expectation in student designed projects is that students have to not only understand the material, but know it well enough that they can pick an appropriate way to present it to their peers. In the AP Government class, when the students were able to present their own projects to the class, many students agreed that they learned the material better than they would have if they had just done a generic presentation. It is common knowledge that when someone knows something really well, that they can teach it, and this kind of presentation enables the student to show exactly how much they know. Student designed projects make sure that students know their class information very well, and can teach it to their peers as a result.\n \n Some might argue that having a teacher designed project is better because when students are given the freedom to do their own project, the quality will not be as high. This, however, is not the case; although there are always counterexamples, the vast majority of students put more work into their presentation when given the opportunity to choose what it looks like. Referring back to the AP Government class, classroom presentations where students had the liberty to present how they chose were always of higher quality than projects where the teacher chose the mode of presenting. This is due to lack of interest in students; if a student is not interested in their project, they will not put as much effort while when students are given a creative outlet, they tend to put more of themselves into their work. Teacher designed projects are not the better of the two options due to their lack of freedom and decreased quality of work as a result.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed to boost creativity, ensure student comprehension, and increase the quality of their projects. When students are given the freedom to express themselves, it improves the learning environment and encourages more students to come to school. Teachers should be able to give their students more freedom in assignments such as summer projects.Â",

      "If I was to receive work for the summer break I would rather it be student designed work and not teacher designed work for many reasons. Theres the fact that if my work was designed by a student someone with a similar mindset as my own I would be able to understand it more clearly than if it was designed by a teacher. Plus theres the fact that student designed work has a possibility of being more simplistic, although teacher designed work is good for challenging the mind and stimulating brain cells im sure students would much rather enjoy there break much sooner. For example if your teacher gave you the choice to have the person to your left choose your summer project for you or have a five page essay on a prompt she gave you which one would you rather do not that hard of a choice is it.\n \n One of the main reasons why I prefer work made by students over work made by teachers is because its easier to comprehend for those who have a harder time understanding more than others. With students making the work It would challenging without being to difficult to the point were it would consume a large amount of time to complete and not anytime to do anything during summer break. Unlike if you got an Teacher assigned project which could have the possibility to consume a large amount of time to complete. Like for example: if hypotheticaly speaking if the person to your left only give an assignment to write one to two paragraphs about a entire country and there culture or get an a your teacher gives you to write a four to five page essay about the history of schoool and how it started.\n \n If I were to have a choice between simple work and complex work I would choose simple almost everytime because of one main reason is it takes less time to do. With the student designed work you would finish faster allowing you to have more free time to enjoy your summer break and relax away from school. Theres also the added benefit of getting more simple work done in a short time frame than you would complex work. I conclude this by saying that it would be more logical to have students design there own work for the summer break rather than have a teacher assign them some work for the summer break.",

      "Good morning Educators of Generic_City. Have you ever wanted your student, who seems to be disengaged or just not interested in class, to actually feel like they have a choice to make their learning experience more exciting? Then, maybe, you can consider this solution. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. As a student, I believe that students don't need summer projects ; it causes a high level a stress. However, if I had a choice then I would consider making summer projects student-designed. Teachers, this could quite literally be the answer to your prayers! Giving your student a chance to design their own summer project would give them a sense of independence that they need. Not only that, but I can guarantee that your student will have the desire to learn by the time summer break is over.\n \n It's not a surprise when students go to their teachers ; not knowing how to complete their assignments. Although, there is absolutely nothing wrong with students asking for help, but I know teachers get tired of repeating themselves. That is why giving students a student-designed project would increase their independence. Back in middle school ; when I went to Generic_School. My English teacher assigned a winter break project. The only requirement was to be creative. My English teacher had come to the conclusion that giving out a rubric would stress out the entire class. Since then, I've been more open to design my own projects. No more : \"How do you do this?\" or, \"Could you repeat that please?\" I am fully aware of what is needed to be done on my own. That independence is just the thing students need to succeed. Some may argue and say that giving students independence would only stunt their work performance. They could even say that students need that sense of reform. However, trying to reform your students would only be in vain. How are students going to fully understand if teachers don't give them the space to be independent? In fact, their work performance would gradually increase. Students take extra time to complete their assignments whenever they get up to ask their teacher a question. Now would you rather have your student waste their work time? Or, would you rather have your student independently do their work?\n \n It may be difficult to believe, but most students do enjoy coming to school to learn new material. If teachers want all of their students to be excited to learn something new ; they should consider how student-designed projects couldÂ possibly help. Its been proven, that half of the student population feel more engaged in a lesson when the have the artistic freedom. Students could write a song about Math, or maybe come up with their own screenplay about the evolution of rocks. Giving your students the power to designing their projects would, soon enough, catch their attention. Teachers could argue and say that it would only be a waste of time. It might be a waste of time, however, your students will feel more engaged with the subject. If you don't want your students to be interested in the lesson, then you might just lose everything you want your student to accomplish.\n \n Creativity is key in todayÂ day in age. Change is inevitable ; you can't hide from it. People desire to learn new things, but want to be creative when doing so. Teachers must be willing to change the way they want to teach their students. Students need a chance to prove that they are capable to be independent. Independence is one of the main things we, as people, try to achieve in the future.",

      "Many students would like to be the ones deciding what project they will do over the summer instead of having it assigned by a teacher. However they may not make wise decisions and they are very likely to choose the easy way out. Therefore, Students should not be allowed to design their summer projects because students will choose something that's too easy, students will procrastinate if they know it is their choice, and students will choose something they're already familiar with and will not learn anything new. Teachers need to assign these summer projects to ensure that students are having a positive and helpful learning experience over summer break.\n \n One reason students should not design their own summer projects is because they'll choose something that's far too easy for them. For example, If Generic_Name tells Generic_Name that he gets to decide what his summer project is, Generic_Name will be very happy because Generic_Name is a good teacher and probably would've given an assignment that he would consider \"too hard.\" Instead, Generic_Name will now go home and take 20 minutes to write about Spongebobs marine life and get an easy A. This will not benefit Generic_Name in any way, shape, or form because Generic_Name took 20 minutes out of 9 weeks to write about non-sense he knows will be an easy A. Therefore, teachers should assign projects in order to assure that students are actually putting their brains to work over the summer.\n \n Another reason students should not design their own summer projects is because many of them will go home thinking they have plenty of time to complete a simple project. This will lead to procrastination and many students will end up forgetting they had a project to do. For the students who procrastinate this will teach them bad habits and for the ones who forget and didn't do it, it will not benefit them at all. By letting students design their own projects in a 9 weeks time span, teachers are opening the doors to bad habits their students may learn. Therefore, teachers should assign these summer projects in order to keep students away from learning bad habits.\n \n In addition, students should not design their own summer projects because teachers know exactly what the students need to learn. The teacher should choose something important, that's not too easy, and that will help the students out in the long run. For example, If Generic_Name assigns Generic_Name to 3 essays about Oceanography , Generic_Name may not be happy, but it will help him a lot years down the road. When Generic_Name gets to 11th grade he will be an essay master, he will get an A in English class, he will score a 600 on his writing SOL, and he will even be an excellent Oceanographer! Generic_Name will look back and be so grateful that Generic_Name gave him that assignment that he hated so much. Generic_Name will now realize that importance of having good projects assigned by qualified people. Teachers should assign summer projects to their classes in order to help them learn useful information that will help them throughout their lives.\n \n In conclusion, it is best to let teachers do their jobs and be the ones to decide on the summer projects. It is always interesting to see what different students choose for their projects, but the most beneficial to students would be the teacher-designed projects. For students it may not be fun but it is what's best for them and it will surely help them a lot more than the easy projects that they would have much rather chosen. Teacher-designed projects is the way to go!Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n By: Generic_Name\n \n Students are in school for 7 hours a day, 45 hours a week, 180 hours a month, and 180 days a year which is a very long time. Many schools in the United States require students to complete a project/assignment to assure that they keep learning over the summer. Students usually feel overwhelmed and stressed about these summer projects because of having to do assignments during their break. I believe that summer projects should be student designed because it allows students to freely choose a topic and not be stressed or worried throughout the whole summer.\n \n When students get assigned summer projects they usually ignore or not do them because the topic might be too boring, hard to do, takes a long time, etc. That's mainly because our teachers don't let them be student designed projects. Student designed projects are when the student gets to choose their own topic, do the work they want to do, and do everything based on what they want. Students hope that it could be student designed projects so it could take some weight off their shoulders and making it a topic they are comfortable with.\n \n Counter Claim: Summer projects should be teacher designed because not all students have great decision making abillities and don't have the skillset to do a project without the teachers help. If it were student designed then they would most definitly go off topic or show poor work and effort on the project. Teacher designed projects are when the teacher is in control. For example, they choose the topic, they choose what research you need to do, they choose if its an essay or a presentation, etc. Teacher designed projects help students get ready for the upcoming school year and what they are gonna be learning in class.\n \n Student designed projects can help the students by learning how to do things on their own, help them gain amazing decision making skills, and gain experiences to help them later on in life. When the teacher's in control for everything then the student may lack in motivation or the will to even do the project. These projects can't help a student grow and learn if they are restricted to certain things that they can and can't do. Students should have the ability to do summer projects on their own with no stress and/or no restrictions.\n \n In sum, students get assigned projects or assignments to take home over the summer so that they could keep learning even during the break. Schools usually make these projects designed by the teacher(s). I believe that these projects should be student designed because summer is meant to be our break, we shouldn't have to have stress or anxiety because of these projects during our summer. Student designed projects can help us gain experiences as a student that we would never learn if they were teacher designed. They also help students feel that they are in control and it could help a student thrive to higher expectations.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "During summer break, many teachers will assign a project that is designed to give students the freedom to work at their own pace and fully discover and interesting topic. When this project is designed too specifically by the teacher, however, many students become disinterested and only do the bare minimum of work. In order to keep students motivated, and make the project beneficial in their future lives, students should be allowed to design their own project for the summer. Student-designed summer projects motivate pupils to create higher quality products, solve diverse real-world problems, and develop unique skill sets that cannot be learned inside the classroom.\n \n On the other hand, there are many who support the use of teacher-designed summer projects, because they are more related to the subjects taught in school and thus more useful in furthering students' education. Opponents cite several studies that show students forget nearly ten percent of what they learn in school over summer break. With a teacher-led project during the break, students will be encouraged to remember and use what they have learned in school instead of letting months of hard work in school go to waste. While it is true that students will learn more of the curriculum through a teacher-designed project, a better use of the time during summer is to teach subjects not covered in the curriculum. Topics that are specific to certain career fields can only be learned through independent study, and student-led summer projects are the most 3 way to encourage this kind of study.\n \n When students are given the freedom to choose a project that plays to their interests and learning style, instead of being forced to do a certain project by their teachers, the quality of the students' projects improves dramatically. One way that this freedom encourages a higher quality project is by increasing student engagement. Modern psychological studies have shown that students are less driven to succeed at a task if they feel they are being forced to accomplish it. Students allowed to choose their own summer project would not feel forced into a specific course of action, increasing their engagement in the assignment and thus the overall quality of their final project. Designing their own project also creates a higher-quality product by adapting it to their own learning styles. Psychologists working in the field of memory have found that students often learn best in one of four learning styles: Reading/Writing, Auditory, Visual, or Kinesthetic. With the ability to adapt the requirements of the assignment to their learning styles,Â students would create a higher-quality product with much less unnecessary effort. Because of this increase in quality, student-designed projects are also very 3 at solving real-world problems.\n \n Projects that have been chosen and designed by students create solutions to real-world problems in ways that teacher-led ones cannot. By deciding on their own projects, students can pursue interests that lie outside of the usual subjects found in school. Summer projects designed by teachers usually focus on one of the few categories of science, english, or mathematics that schools teach. Students who are provided the opportunity to design a project on their own will be able to pursue fields of study that are not touched on by schools, gaining knowledge in many other diverse areas of study. In addition, the ability to choose their own projects allow students to tackle problems that face our world today with their own unique solutions. As one example of this, a team of students who chose their own project for science class was able to create groundbreaking new technology for removing floating debris from the ocean, which has the potential to improve the lives of billions of people who depend on the health of the ocean to survive. If more students could pursue their interests in the same way that this team did, many new solutions to today's problems would emerge. In addition, students who pursue their own interests in this way are also much more prepared for their chosen careers in the future.\n \n Student-designed projects develop unique skills in students that are not learned through teacher-led study. One skill that independent projects teach is the ability to do creative, independent work. As adults, many find that leadership positions in the workplace require some degree of creativity, and tasks must often be completed with little input from those higher in the chain of authority. By allowing students to produce their own ideas and work on their own schedule, rather than assigning students ideas and schedules, student-led projects encourage the traits that are necessary for any productive member of society. In giving students the independence to try out their own ideas, these projects also allow students to learn skills that are not covered by the main subjects of traditional schooling. For example, a student interested in becoming a veterinarian would not learn very much about his or her desired career through the core classes, but would learn a great deal through a project requiring him or herÂ to study animals. Student-designed projects, therefore, are much more 3 than teacher-designed ones when it comes to preparing students for their future professions, and for their future lives as a whole.\n \n When students are presented the opportunity to design their own summer projects, they become motivated to improve the quality of their work, make a lasting impact on the real world, and develop unique skills that can aid them in future careers. When students are given the freedom to choose who they want to be early on in their lives, they become better equipped in the future to make their dreams a reality. In order to produce students who are skilled, 3, and motivated to succeed, teachers should allow their students to choose what subjects they would like to explore during the summer.",

      "When someone says the word summer, people don't generally think about classrooms, or tardy bells, or chalkboards. Rather, about freedom from all of those things. Summer is a much needed break from the stressful conditions of school, however, whenever summer is ending and it's time to start heading back to school, students sometimes find themselves forgetting most of what they learned the year before. Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over the summer to ensure that they keep learning outside of the classroom, and to keep what they have learned the year before, fresh in their minds. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust.\n \n Summer is the time of year where students generally feel stress-free. There's no due dates, and no pressing homework. If these mandatory projects were teacher-designed, summer would feel more like school, and then students would have a bad connotation with the word summer. Sometimes people brush under the rug how stressful school can actually be to students, and summer is a much needed break. Though students do need to continue learning, it would be hard for a teacher to assign a project that fit everyone's specific needs and was appropriate for all students outside of the classroom. Summer break was installed for a reason, because if students go to school for 12 months, they'll more than likely get burnt out and will lose the motivation to learn. If students are allowed to design their own projects, they won't see it as school, but as fun.\n \n Students-no matter what age; kids, pre-teens, teenagers- haven't fully developed yet. They don't know who they are, or what they want, or what they believe in, because all they've known is their parents and the little bubble they live in for the first 18 years of their life. They try to find themselves everyday, they try to discover what their identity is. If students were able to design their own over the summer projects, they would be more likely to do it. There comes a point during childhood when people start to question authority, and start to become rebellious because they think they know what's best for themselves. At some point, kids have to be given that freedom in order for them to fail, gain humility, and then try again. If teachers were the ones designing the projects, students would be less likely to do it, and their grades would suffer.\n \n Teachers will generally tell you that trust is everything. If you don't have trust then you have nothing. Getting to pick your own project as a student, I would be elated. It shows that your teacher trusts that you will make the right decision and that you will get it done. The projects should differ from child to child because if one child wants to excel, then the limitations on the project to make another student comfortable, should not restrict him. Student-designed projects gives the students opportunity to excel in learning and to gain more trust from their teachers. Students usually have breakthroughs at least once during the years they are in school, when they start to realize that what they're learning is important and they start to care about what it is that they're learning, and learning becomes less like a burden and more like a privilege. Designing their own projects could spurr on this breakthrough and help students to realize that school isn't as bad as once anticipated.\n \n Summer should be a break from all the things that cause stress in the everyday lives of students. It should be a time to unwide and relax. Schools are beginning to issue over-the summer projects to make sure that the students keep learning, and remember what they have previously learned. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust. This will ensure that students stay happy over the summer, while teachers are equally as happy knowing that all of their hard work to educate the students has not gone to waste.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Should these summer projects that students work on during their break be teacher-designed or student-designed? Students should be able to put their own ideas in this summer project and designed it the way they want it to be. These projects should help them make their brains become more active since they will be doing these projects over break. By doing this they won't have to \"refresh\" their brain on what they learned the past school year and will already know what to do when they come back to school after break because of this project.\n \n All students should put their ideas into their own projects and don't have to worry about what the teacher may give them. This can make the students become more active in the world or even school, and actually let them do something over break. They should let the students decide what type of project they want to work on that is helpful for them to continue to learn during break. If the students decide what they want to work on, then they should decide if it's going to take them the whole break or a couple of weeks to finish it. For example, they could do something they love to do over break instead of a teacher throwing any type of project to give them. Some students may be busy during break so this gives them the opportunity to work at their own pace. Since they know what they are doing for their project it shouldn't be that hard for them to manage.\n \n If the students designed the projects then it would let them be more engage on what they are learning and what's going on during their break. The school will have less students who are confused on what's going on and the teacher wouldn't have to keep explaining themselves more than once. Also, it can actually make the students want to do the project, because they are doing something they like instead of the teacher designing something boring. Sometimes the students forget about the project that the teachers designed to them because they don't want to do it or they just didn't understand the idea the teacher was giving them. Therefore, if the students designed it themselves then the school and teachers won't have to worry about who did or didn't do the project.\n \n Some people may think that teachers should be able to designed these projects. They may even think that the kids are not mature enough to do it and it's a teachers job to design them things. I understand it is a teachers job to teach the students, but it wouldn't be fun if all the teacher do is use his or her's own ideas. Shouldn't the students have a right to do things they like with the teachers helping them on the side. If they work together with the students and be more active with them, then that's when the students behave more mature and actually want to do the work. No students likes a teacher who only just talks and only do things their way without the students input.\n \n Students should be able to pick out what type of project they want to do and work it out step by step to complete it. If students do this on their own, then they could learn how to plan and manage things by themselves. They would be learning how to be more independent. This way it can help them later on in the future if they ever go to college and even for their future jobs. This could help the students be creative and have different types of creativity and ideas all around the school. Then, the school will have an idea on what interests their students and know more about them individually as a person.Â",

      "Some schools require students to do projects during the summer, and whether the projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed. In my opinion,the summer projects should be teacher-designed because it can be helpful for future related times and giving guidelines can make the projects much easier. Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to it be able to benefit them the upcoming school year.\n \n To start with, teachers can give students guidelines for the project. The more instructions the students are able to have then the more understandable the project can be. Getting guidelines can give the students more ideas and can be less frustrating doing the project can be. For example,Generic_Name,a student at Generic_School,is spending time starting her project,she is confused on what to do from the beginning until she opened the guidelines that she was giving, having the guidelines made it much more easier to finish due to having a list on what was needed for the project.\n \n Secondly,having to do projects under teacher circumstances can be beneficial for related times in the future. Many more projects could come and be far more complicated,but using their current knowledge from past experience can make the project less frustrating. For example,Generic_Name has to start an project,now that the students are back in school from break,in the past he would struggle with projects,but by using his past knowledge that he learned,he had finished and reached all the expectations needed. In conclusion,using knowledge that you learned from the same situation in the past on your current ones can very much help in the future.\n \n Some people may disagree due to others seeing it in different ways. Others may see the project as not interesting because the students should be able to do it the way they want to due to them having to do the object during the summer and it not being able to benefit them because the students can not look back on their mistakes. Although, the project not being interesting should not be the case because they are learning not playing around. In addition, the students should know that having ideas on an project can help more so confusing them.\n \n In conclusion,these are my reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The project being teacher-designed,allows more ideas that the students are able to use and makes the project easier. The students should now be able to use the guidelines to be able to benefit them on future projects on their upcoming year.Â Â  Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "Think back to a time during the summer, you finally get a break from school, you can relax and do whatever you usually do in your leisure time, but you remember that you have an uninteresting, unwanted, summer project assigned by your teacher that is due in the new school year. Any student can say that they've had a summer project that they rather just not do, yet they have to face the fact that at some point they will have to get over not wanting to do it and push themselves to get it done anyway. Some people may say that summer projects designed by teachers are more affective on the students due to the teacher displaying their style of lesson plans and how they like to teach their students new material depending on the specific lesson. However, I think they are wrong because ifÂ students are able to design their own summer projects, they will be more engaged with the topic it's centered around, they will be able to compromise on a learning style for the project that suits them the most, and the amount of students who turn their projects in on time, fully completed, will increase drastically.\n \n Student-designed summer projects will ensure that students will be more engaged with the project and what they are learning. It is known that if you allow students to give their input on how they would like a certain, assignment, project, or lesson to be created for them, they will end up being more engaged with whatever the specific form of learning may be. The ideas from the students will circle around and bounce off the walls until the most attractive ideas for the assignment, lesson, or in this case project, have been surfaced. Students also enjoy swapping the roles of teacher and student because it allows the student to ensure they will recieve a good grade, enjoy doing the project, and comprehend what they are learning in the best way. Some people may say that students should be able to adapt to whatever way teacher presents a topic of learning and a project to you. However, they are wrong because the way a teacher designs a project can be challenging and take the student a decent amount of time to comprehend how a teacher specifically wants a project done. In conclusion, allowing a student to design their own summer project will raise the chances of a student being fully engaged with the topic of learning and the project.\n \n Student-designed summer projects also come with the benefit of being able to compromise on a specific learning style for the project that will best suit all of the students that have to do it. An example would be that some students learn best visually, they like to have things taught to them shown through diagrams and pictures, so that they can invisualize the topic at hand. The learning style that fits the student the best will display how well they do on the project because of them being able to comprehend it better. I have experienced seeing students ask teachers to explain the topic that they are learning in a different way from what the teacher explained it to them, so that the information could mentally mesh within their brain. Sometimes it takes a certain approach for a student to understand what they are learning and it takes a learning style that best suits them to do that. Some people may say that students don't always have a choice in the learning style a teacher chooses to teach them in. However, they are wrong because students will express to teachers that the information given to them needs to be in a form that best mimics their personal learning style. In conclusion, a student-designed summer project benefits the student by being able to learn the way that suits them best while being away from school, at home, using their specific learning style.\n \n Student designed summer projects will increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time drastically. A summer project given to a student that does not interest them will cause a student to procrastinate, miss the deadline and have to turn it in late, or just not turn it in at all due to the fact that it is summer and most students aren't very concerned with school work. The project must sincerely gain the excitement of the students so that the project will get completed and turned in on time. If students are able to design the specifics of the project the completion and turning in of the project would decrease overall. For example, from my experience of having summer projects I myself, and other students that I know, have waited until the last minute to do a summer project because of the way the teacher designed it for us. Students are the best people to design projects for what they may be learning because they know what they like and the best ways to instill what they are learning in their brains. Some people may say that students completing their summer projects and turning them in on time depends on the students' skill of time-management. However, they are wrong because time-management wouldn't play a factor in a student-designed project due to the project being designed by themselves, which would ultimately encourage them to do it. In conclusion a student-designed summer project would increase the amount of comepleted and turned in projects allowing the students to have their input in it.\n \n I believe that if students are able to design their own summer projects the students will be more enganged in the project, compromise on a learning style that suits them the best for the project, and increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time. Students will have a better understanding of what needs to be done for the project and set a specific criteria. Students will be able to not only get done, but enjoy their project will completing it over the summer. The project will not be catered to one style of learning, to the vast majority of students. Also, students designing their summer projects will motivate them to finish the project on time due their incorporation of ideas.",

    essay:
      "Summer break is a time period of relaxation for students who have worked hard all year in school. Students tend to go on vacations where they forget everything they learned throughout the year. This is why teachers assign summer projects to make sure that their students are still learning and that they still stay engaged with academics on their breaks. As a high schoolÂ student myself, I dread summer projects for the reason of having to complete school work whilst on vacation. When my teacher assigns a summer project, it is usually something that is boring and not engaging with other students. Student-designed summer projects have a completely different approach to them. When students can design their own summer projects, it encourages creativity and individuality from the student, it will encourage students to engage with other classmates and it creates a wide range of available topics to learn about.\n \n When summer projects are student-designed, it allows students to portray their creativity and individuality. When a teacher assigns a project that forces a student to do a task that is not appealing to them, they do not put in their best effort and they do not learn anything from it. For example, when a teacher asks their students to read a book and write an essay on it, students will not be inclined to complete it and will put it off until the end of summer. If the project was student-designed, the student could read the book of their choice and show their understanding of it in many ways. They could show off their creativity by creating something no other students has created, they can portray their own likingÂ and not dread doing it like many students do with teacher-designed projects. Teachers should encourage individuality from their studentsÂ and theyÂ can do this by creating student-designed summer projects.\n \n Summer can be about engaging with friends and family and student-designed summer projects promote that. Students can engage with others to work on a project of their own liking. Engaging with other classmates helps with communication skills,leadership skills and other character traits that can help a student develop academically outside of school. Working with other students is not a necessity for summer-designed projects, where working individually has its own pros as mentioned before. This shows the 3ness of student-designed projects as both methods of learning are both engaging and academic. Teacher-designed projects can also have students work with each other and promote the engagement with other students, however, they do not allow students to use their own liking and interests as freely when working with others. Student-designed summer projects would allow any person to work with anyone based off their interests which would most 3ly help their learning experience.\n \n Learning is meant to be engaging and interesting and student-designed projects encourages this type of learning. With student-designed summer projects, the topics that can be discussed and learned about are endless. The student has the wide range of topics they can learn about and portray their learning in a creative way so that it is an engaging and interestingÂ experienceÂ for the student. Depending on the subject, the student can use his hobbies to create something that appealsÂ to their interests so that they're using this experienceÂ to actually learn in an academic manner. Teacher-designed summer projects are usually limited to a small range of possibilities in terms of topics where the student is forced to learn about something unappealing which makes the learning expirecne 1 for the students, where as student-designed projects let the students use their own interests to create a topic in which they think will most 3ly complete the project\n \n During summer break, students tend to take their mind off of academics and they forget about most of the things they learned about in the year prior. Summer projects help students engage with academics during the long break so that they are ready to come back to school once the time comes. Summer projects can be tedious for students because of the way that they are designed by teachers. Student-designed projects take away the forced work that teachers put upon their students and create an enjoyable yet 3 learning experience. Student-designed summer projects can help students engage with classmates, encourage creativity and individuality and creates a wide range of discusableÂ topics. Student-designed projects make the summer expirecne a more enjoyable time by letting the students create a project based on their own experiences and liking and not forcing them to complete tedious tasks.

      "Summer projects allow students to have the opportunity to learn while they are not in school and it can benefit them in many ways. Summer projects should be designed by students because it gives students the opportunity to learn more about something of their choice, it shows that they have a connection with the project, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things.\n \n Students should be given the opportunity to create a project about something of their choice. It gives them independence and the ability to rely on themselves. It is good to give students independence starting at a young age because it allows them to be self reliant. Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.\n \n Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic. Teachers love when a student creates a well designed and well thought out project. If a student were to be given a project designed by the teacher, the student would feel like they couldn't do much with it because they have no connection with it. When students have a connection with something it makes them feel more enthusiastic about the project or assignment given to them.\n \n Students are more eager to learn about new things after they researched something of their choice. When students have a choice, they would rather research something that they don't know too much about. After that topic is researched they feel enlightened. Students also tend to branch off of the topic that they first researched as well. This technique is often used by students because it makes research easier for them and they like to make things easier for them rather than harder.\n \n In conclusion, Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it gives them new opportunities, it shows that they can connect to something, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things. Although teachers can provide students with a base and a template for their project, it would be best and beneficial for students to be able to create and think of something on their own. Students are more prepared for college and high up positions in life when they are given the opportunity to create something of their own. It allows students to have independence and other useful tools for their future.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Hello, reader! My name is Generic_Name. Some schools require student to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. many question if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that students should be the ones planning their own summer projects because it will be their summer vacation that they'll have in order to work on it. If the teachers are the ones designing the projects for their students, then teachers will most likely get the same thing from every student. Not only that, we as students may not enjoy doing it as much, because when it comes to doing big projects like these, we desire to put in our own creativity. For these next two paragraphs, I will be talking about these two reasons in greater detail before ending this prompt with my conclusion. They will be backed up mostly by my personal experience, but I will put in my own opinions and reasons. I will also be putting in lots of unique words that will this prompt more interesting. Now, let's begin.\n \n I don't believe teachers should be the ones planning out the project not for the fact that what they would assign will be boring or bad, but because each student might end up doing the same thing for each individual prompt, even if each student does put theyre own unique sense of creativity into them. For example, last year when I was doing Driver's Ed, we entered the part of Health & First Aid. And when all was said and done, we were given a project to do. It had to be be done on a tri-fold and the information had to be a printed out PowerPoint. I'll be honest, I really wasn't a happy chum doing the project at first, although I did enjoy doing the PowerPoint part of the project mostly because I have a love for PowerPoints. When the day came for the projects to turned in and graded, we all showed our own tri-folds to the class. Here, I noticed that we all did similar things in each of our tri-folds. True, we were each given a different topic to work on and many us got a little creative, but in the end we were pretty much the same.\n \n I understand that they do that to make certain we don't procrastinate or do minimum, but in order the project to have some form of uniqueness & full creativity, the student should have complete charge over the what & how of the project. an example of this happened last year in my Spanish II class, where we did a project that was about choosing three Latino recipes and write them out in Spanish. Our teacher, Sr. Generic_Name allowed us to make our project however we wanted, from being a cookbook, miniature tri-fold, PowerPoint, etc. But he also wanted to see our full potential, not just in art but in language as well, so using an online translator was generally unacceptable. And although he was fine with three simple but complete sheets of paper, there wouldn't be any bonus points for that. Fortunately, I paid attention in his class and my mother a Puerto Rican cookbook which she lend to me to use. Also, I don't mean to brag but I'm a great artist who it self-taught.\n \n Overall, I believe that students should their own thing in the project while at the same time, the teachers should receive something of great quality. The two examples I just talked about are my personal experiences & reasons why I believe in the power of the student, although I greatly understand the teacher's viewpoint giving us the basic backbone. So, in a way, neither side is perfect or wrong. But of course, thats just my opinion.",

    essay:
      "The thought of summer brings out joyous feelings; people usually think of summer as vacations, time to hang out with friends, explore new hobbies, relax, etc. When students are asked to describe summer, one of the last things they would describe it as is a time to do school projects since most students actually picture it as a break from stressful schoolwork. School is the last thing on their mind throughout summer, which could cause students to put off their projects to the side to do last minute and think of it as a chore, rather than something that is enjoyable or fun to complete. However, this image can be changed and summer projects can be turned into something that students are motivated to do. If summer projects were student-designed rather than teacher-designed, it could be more catered to what students' interests and likes, students could be more motivated to complete them, and they would be less likely to procrastinate on them.\n \n Student-designed summer projects would have more of what students want since it would be more catered to what they like. Students know each others' needs and what they enjoy--they can agree on what could be considered a fun project and what they consider to be stress-inducing project. With student-designed summer projects, more of a students' likes would be covered, which means it would be more enjoyable for them to work on it over the summer. With more of their interests in a project and with a project they deem as fun--or any type of work at all--students would be more likely to spend more time and energy on it. With teacher-designed summer projects, less interests could be covered, leading to students not putting as much into it as they would if it was student-designed. With student-designed summer projects, these would appeal more to them than a teacher-designed project would, because, as aforementioned, students know what students want to see in projects. When summer projects are student-designed instead of teacher-designed, it would be more catered to what they want and with their interests--which can bring many great benefits to students while working on them.\n \n With more summer projects catered to students, students would be more motivated to complete these projects. They would be eager to work on these projects. Teachers do not understand what students want since they are from different generations, they do not know the current trends or hobbies that they enjoy as much as a student would know. When these projects are designed from people their own age, they know what each other usually like or enjoy. Their interests being addressed would give them a motivation to complete these summer projects, and not only that, but they would genuinely enjoy doing them and most likely want to do them. With motivation, students are able to produce better work. When people are less motivated to complete assignments, they usually put it off to the side or are not able to work as efficiently on it. When students are given projects that they genuinely like, they would stay on track and possibly even go out of their way to go above and beyond from what is asked of them and try and learn more about it on their own. Motivation can boost students to do better, so when summer projects appeal to them more, they would be more motivated to learn more and improve.\n \n Procrastination is a common theme throughout students, but can be helped if they are assigned something they like to do. With student-designed projects, since students would be more motivated and have more of their interests in them, which would lead them to be less likely to procrastinate. With teacher-designed projects, they would be more likely to procrastinate since it might not cover things that a student wants to see as much as a student-designed project. That could lead to the student retaining less knowledge and learning less from the project, which is the opposite of what it is intended to do. When students do not procrastinate and leave it last minute, they are able to spend more time on a project and learn more from it. They would not view these projects as a chore or as something that they have to get done before summer ends.Â Not only that, but they would be able to work more efficiently on it with more time spent. Others might also claim that a teacher-designed project would be more 3 than a student-designed one since a teacher could have more experiences than a student and a teacher knows the materials more; however, a student-designed summer project would be formated more familiarly for students. Students know how each other work, and each generation differs from one another. Their projects would cater to their generation more and include things that they like to work on. Also, others could argue that some would still procrastinate and push it off to the side anyways, regardless of it being teacher-designed or student-designed. However, not all solutions can solve a hundred percent of the issue at hand but having student-designed projects could still solve the majority of the problems a teacher-designed project produces. So student-designed projects better address the large issue of procrastination among the youth--more than a teacher-designed project--and help students be able to grasp more of the concepts being taught and learn and retain more from these projects.\n \n In conclusion, a student designed summer project would be the most efficient way for students to be able to continue learning throughout their summer break, and not only that, but have a project that contains their interests which can lead to having motivation to complete them and not procrastinate on. This would be the most efficient way since it is catered to what they want since students know what each other want best. The image of summer being fun would continue to exist and these summer projects would be enjoyable to complete and look forward to.Â",

Summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects.\n \n Some people say summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would help them practice for topics that would be discussed the next school year. However, summer projects should be student-designedÂ because students could be more creative with what they do. For example, when a teacher assigns you a project the set their projects to be something specificÂ like: show a graph, create a drawing of this, and/or write a essay about this. When there are limited options like this, students that struggle at something like drawing could be put at a disadvantage and not grade as high as other students. Thats why if summer projects are student-designed students would be able to show off the talents they have and be more creative with what they present as their summer project.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because student can go at their own pace. For example, some projects could require students to do something that they dont understand and therefore they wouldn't be able to complete their project. However, if summer projects would be student-designed the students would be able to complete the project because they could do something that they know how to do and its at their own learning pace and they could also help teacher know what a student struggles at and what they know really well.\n \n Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because students would be more inclined to do complete their project. For example, one of the reasons many student don't complete their projects is because they think that the projects are too boring or are too hard. However, if the students get to choose what they are going to turn in as their summer project then they would do projects that they think are fun or aren't too hard and many more students would turn in their projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because students could be more creative, students can go at their own pace, and students would be more inclined to complete their projects. For these reasons, I implore teachers to allow summer projects to be student-designed.",

      "On that faithful June afternoon, the school bell rings for its last time in three months. Students rush out of their classes and greet the summer with open arms. Of course, once school opens up again in August, many of these students have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Many schools assign projects to complete over the summer in order to keep their students' minds sharp; however, there are debates as to whether the teachers or the students should design the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so students can properly develop the tools that will help them succeed the following year.\n \n Teacher-designed projects will set the rigor of the class so students know what to expect. It is most likely that the teacher that assigns the project will be the one instructing the class. If teachers design the project, they can set the guidelines for the year in their summer assignment so students are not caught off guard. This is especially important for higher level classes such as honors or AP; it is best that all students are aware of the class' expectations so they can develop their skills as necessary for the course. Students can also decide whether or not the class is right for them, whether it be because it is too rigorous, not rigorous enough, or simply because the subject matter does not interest them. This way there is less fuss during the school year as students try to switch their classes.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can allow the students to grow their academic independence. During the school year, teachers are readily available in case students need to answer questions. However, during the summer it is not as easy as raising one's hand in class; students are almost entirely on their own. They will have to develop the skills needed to solve a novel problem independently. This ability is referred to by psychologists as fluid intelligence. One's fluid intelligence decreases with age, so it is important for students to strengthen it while they are young. Students may also find useful academic tools that help them to understand the material of the class. One of the more well known of these tools is Khan Academy. Students often go to these websites to understand what they could not in class. Finding these tools during the summer will prove useful, as they can still be used during the school year.\n \n While student input is important, the teachers are more likely to give projects that are closer in rigor and content to the actual class. Teachers have been trained both in teaching that the subject that they teach, so they likely know the best way to prepare students for what lies ahead. This is why summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students.",

      'Having to do school work over the summer? Summer assignments is a great way for students to not forget everything they learned over the school year. If a student goes from June to September without reviewing their course material from the previous years, they are bound to forgetting lots of important information. Students have very creative minds and should be able to come up with their own way of studying or going over past information. Teacher designed assignments can force students to do unnecessary research which can waste a lotÂ of time. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows each student to put their time in to something that interests them, teachers can learn more about their future students, and teacher designed projects sometimesÂ dis encourageÂ students to complete them.\n \n There is nothing better in school or in life when you are interested in a subject. It is much easier to pay attention and a lot more information that sticks with you. Doing a lot of research into a topic your not interested in is more or less a waste of time. A project led by a student could influence others to a career choice. Having to do work is never fun especially in summer but if students get to be creative they can find a topic which makes it more enjoyable. Teacher designed projects limits students into following certain formats and structures which limits the thought process being taken into place thinking about the project. Once again interesting topics lead to better productivity and work which is why students need to design their own projects.\n \n Forming relationships as a teacher is something that can change a students life forever. There are many kids in today society who feel like they don\'t belong or fit in. Knowing and appreciating someone the smallest can impact them more than someone can imagine. A student who creates their own project or structure will definitely tell you something about them. Engaging students with each others work is important to show the passion one may have for what they made. Student designed projects open up the opportunity to really show how much a subject matters and what can be done to change a way in society that is failing. Teachers knowing more about their students is important for students to want to come to class and for teachers to know when someone is not appearing to be feeling their normal selves.\n \n Teacher designed projects are usually straightÂ forward. When a student designs a project they complete much more work. Now I would say that if the students are below 5th grade having teacher designed projects is the better option due to most students at that level not being educated enough to think outside of the box. Regardless learning will take place on both sides and that students will dive deep enough into a subject to break the ice. Relationships will form from students bonding over ideas and sharing them with each other.\n \n When the question "should a teacher or student design a summer project?" comes up, I am aware that both sides has an argument but that students designing it is way more impactful to themselves and others. Career choices can easily be introduced while just selecting a topic. Forcing students to be oppurtunitive and aware student designed projects open it all up and enable them to select something that is interesting and important. Teacher designed projects are good when there is not a lot of time but having the whole summer gives each student many hours to work on an design their own masterpiece.',

      "Have you ever got a summer project?Â Summer projects are boring to do when all you want to do is have fun. Although, teachers can make the projects subject based and more specific.Â Students should design the summer projects because some students don't have access to internet, the projects will be unique, and the projects will have more effort and participation.\n \n Firstly, some students don't have access to the internet. Most projects involve research. If the students can't do the research how are they going to do the project? Some teachers expect the project to be done but what if it can't be. Teachers need to realize not everyone has internet at home. For example, a student was given a project on King Henry's life. He doesn't have internet at home and the library is too far to walk. The student never did his project and got a really bad grade.\n \n Secondly, the projects will be unique. The ideas that students can come up with are amazing. Kids have an unlimited amount of imagination and creativity, so letting them express that through a graded project can be really fun. For example, if the students were doing a science project. They have so many possibilities on what they can do. They could put Mentos in a diet Coke and write down what happens. If it was a photography project, the students can express themselves through the pictures and edit them however you want. There's so many more ideas tat students can come up with if you let them.\n \n Thirdly, The projects will have more effort and participation. If the students have their own say, or choice, in what they get to do the project on, there would be more projects turned in. Plus, the effort put into the projects would be greater. For example, one class gets to choose their project and another class do not get to choose. The class that got to pick their project has more projects, and more effort put into the projects, then the class that didn't get to choose. Another example is the teachers choose what students do one year for summer projects. Many students do not put in a lot of effort, just enough to get a good grade, and some don'tÂ even bother turning it in. The next year, the teachers let the students pick what to do for their projects. Most of the students turn in the projects and a lot of effort was put into them.\n \n In conclusion, students should design the projects instead of the teachers. Some students do not have internet. The projects will be unique. Also, the effort put it and the participation of the projects will be greater. If you have a summer project, convince your teacher to let the class design it. You'll see so many cool projects you might have not thought of.",

    essay:
      "In a 2019 survey about homework during the summer, it was found that the majority of students said that they were extremely stressed aboutÂ summer assignments that teacher's had required them to do. Many of the students expressed that they had busy schedules and could not find the time to complete the assignments. Other's said that the projects were too difficult and confusing because they were designed poorly.Â While some will say that these summer assignments should continue to be designed by teachers because they are more educational, to be beneficial, the assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption.\n \n Firstly, summer assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom. For instance, the majority of the assignments are question or essay based. This means that instead of enjoying a learning activity that applies to them, students will have to answer dull repetitive questions and write uninteresting essays about topics that they have no passion for. In result, students will put minimum effort into the assignments and finish them without learning anything. Also, if the summer assignments were designed by the students, they would pick a topic that they have interest in or believe would be enjoyable to complete. For example, if a project was assigned that allowed students to present an issue that they found interesting, the student would more than likely be excited and motivated to write about their topic. Overall, projects assigned during the summer should be designed by the students in order to prevent boredom.\n \n Secondly, students should design their summer assignments to prevent frustration. This is because during the summer, teachers will assign packets or papers that are confusing and difficult to complete, thinking that it will be beneficial or educational. However, this is not the case. Many students will find themselves stuck or frustrated trying to complete something that they have no idea how to do. This results in uncompleted or incorrect work that then starts the student's school year off poorly. Furthermore, if the assignments were designed by the students, they would have the ability to preview and understand what the project is asking. In other words, they would have the correct knowledge going into the assignment and will ultimatelyÂ learn more about the material for the following school year. In the end, a project designed by a student will prevent frustration.\n \n Lastly, summer projects designed by the students will take up less time. This is because many students are extremely busy during the summer. Between sports, vacations, and possible online classes, students find it difficult to manage summer homework. Teachers are not aware of every student's schedule and can assign projects that are almost impossible to complete. However, if the projects were designed by the students, this would not occur. Instead, students would design a project that they could easily time manage and complete in their own time. Also, because teacher-designed projects are long and complicated, this can cause a student to miss out on fun activities. This is becauseÂ of the created stress and limited time that the students often experience from the projects assigned. For example, during the summer, many students are traveling and are rarely in town at the same time. However, when they are, a student with an unfinishedÂ project, could miss out on an opportunity to see their friend because they are too busy with homework. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed because this would prevent time consumption.\n \n Overall, students should design the summer projects. This is because it will prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption. If students experience these effects, the projects assigned will not only ultimately be 1 but it will cause unnecessary stress. The purpose of summer is to enjoy a break from school anxiety. If projects do not reflect this, then a student's summer could possibly be ruined. In the end, in order prevent this, talk to your teacher and see if your summer could be saved with an enjoyable, simple, and quick project instead.Â",

      "Throughout a students educational experience, they have the 3 month break at the end of each year that allows them to have time off and have a break from the intense rigor of school. Although, the break can better be purposed by having assignments to further their knowledge during this time period. These projects can best be designed as student led so that students can have more creativity and imagination towards the project, specialize one topic based on future educational interest, and ensures that students have the resources they need to complete the assignment.\n \n From Kindergarten through grade 12, each student is given a curriculum to follow and learn for a standardized test at the end of the year; student led summer projects would allow for a broader outlook on their schooling education and explore topics that would not be looked at otherwise. A student who only learns about their immediate community and ecosystem can gain a broader perspective on society after completing a summer project about an ecosystem in another region of the world. The additional thought and imagination put into a project like this would be hard to complete in an organized project created by a teacher. Furthermore, students commonly bored duringÂ one project that a large group of students have to complete. The rules and rubric which have to be followed deprive the students of exploration and investigation which is crucial for a successful education. Allowing for students to find their choice of exploration and then present it in a unique way brings a complex ideology about interesting topics. Not only is the content of student led projects productive, but so is the way of deriving that information. Commonly, classrooms follow a strict set of rules to ensure each students safety, but those rules come with a cost. The rules cause students to think in one way, act in one way, and test in one specific way. A summer project which gives students space to compete based on their creativity allows them to break out of those boundaries and complete what they want to complete.\n \n A students future college path can also be benefited by student based summer projects due to the option of focusing on their desired topic. As students age into their final years of high school, many already know the path they want to take in college and ultimately their occupations. Giving students an option to focus and research on these topics will not only allow them to understand more about the topic but also build their application to give them a better chance at getting into respected schools. A student who wants to explore the medical pathway might use the summer project as a chance to see what the field is about. That student might shadow surgeons or pediatricians and then analyze and report their findings. The alternate option of teacher led student projects would not allow for this type of unique opportunity. Using the report of their findings, a student can better apply for prestigious college opportunities, scholarships and programs through their past experience that gives them a step up from their competing applicants.\n \n Lastly, the guidelines given to the entirety of the public schooling system leaves students in lower socioeconomic situations to not be able to complete certain projects. The student led project system allows students to find a topic that is accessible for them rather than one that has a large demand for expensive purchases. Certain projects specifically in the science department, require an excessive amount of resources making them hard to obtain out of the school setting. If the teacher led projects would require students to purchase these goods, difficulties would arise in regards to the ability for all students to have access and an abundance of these items. Although supplies may be given through the schooling system, a work spaceÂ might be difficult to obtain as well. Choosing a project that not only gains the students interest but also allows them to complete it with ease displays the benefits of student led projects.\n \n Projects that can be completed during the summer should be led by the students desires and aspirations as it will gain allow for the most success of the student. Student led projects show most 3 through the ability for students to use their imagination, research a topic they might study in college, and complete the work productively and efficiently.",

      "Every year students look forward to going on summer break and getting away from school. This three month break often involves forgetting important skills and not learning new information. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to solve these problems. These projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that the project is relevant, has a difficulty on grade level with that of the student, and allows for easy collaboration and communication.\n \n While being able to pick their own topic for a summer project may be more fun for students, a teacher-designed project would insure that the information being learned connects to what they need to know for school. A random project in the middle of break is a waste of time if the teacher cannot connect it to what the students will be learning in class. For example, a physics teacher may want to assign a project to introduce momentum or energy, this will allow students to come into class with a general understanding of the subject. Having a project with a specific learning goal will make students feel as if they are making the most of their time and are learning something that will be useful in the future.\n \n When given the task of creating their own projects, students will often design the easiest project they can get away with. Teachers can ensure appropriate difficulty in the projects by designing them themselves. Projects can be adjusted so they are suitable for different grades and class types; the more difficult the class is, the more difficult the project will be. Students wouldn't be able to complete the easiest project they can or overestimate themselves and design a project too hard.\n \n During the summer it is important for students to be able to contact their teachers and ask for help. If a project is student-designed, a teacher may have difficulty assisting a student if they become confused and need help. A teacher-designed project would make asking for and receiving help a lot easier. If the teacher-designed project were to be uniformly distributed to all students taking similar class, the students would be able to collaborate and ask each other for help as well. Completing the assignment in groups would be more fun for the students and easier to grade for the teachers.\n \n Summer projects need to be teacher-designed so they are on topic, have a reasonable difficulty, and allow for optimal communicate and collaboration. Summer projects are often dreaded by students, but a teacher-designed project is more beneficial than a student-designed project.",

      "After school ends, most children spend their summers relaxing with their friends and family. Not many of us do anything educational on the rare occasion that we may read a book. Because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning during their break. Students should be able to design their own projects because the project itself will be more enjoyable, easier to complete, and more beneficial to students in terms of knowledge.\n \n Many of the projects that teachers assign during the school year are pretty boring. By designing their own summer project, students can have a fun experience with it. Not only that, but students will also be much more inclined to actually do the project. As an AP student, I have been assigned summer assignments for classes, which I ended up doing last minute. These assignments weren't hard, but they ended up being pretty long since we were given two months to complete them. Since I pushed them to the last minute, I was sitting in my house for hours for the last couple of days trying to get these projects done. Now, if I had found a project to do for the class, I would have completed it throughout the course of the break and would have had had a much better time completing it.\n \n Something that we all know is that if you are actually interested in completing the task at hand, you will be much more efficient in completing it rather than a task you are not interested in. Because of this exact reason, students should be able to design their own project because it would be way easier to complete. Not only that, but students will actually feel like its their own task to complete, rather than some random assignment that is assigned by the teacher. Most students, including myself, complete homework for a class the night before its due. Many people think the ideal way of completing homework is to complete it the day it is assigned, but since, most of the time, students aren't really interested in the work, they end up cramming it to a later day. Although, if the student has a task from something that they are interseted in, such as the sport they play, then they will do that as soon as they can.\n \n Another beneficial factor from being able to design your own summer project is that it is much more knowledgeable then a tradtional assignment. What I mean by more knowledgeable is how much knowledge the student actually gains from completing a specific assignment. A particular assignment may require research that allows students to gain a lot of knowldedge, but if the student is bored by the topic, then they will just try to finish the assignment by whatever means possible. They will not try to learn the topic, and will probably end up getting the answers online or from a friend. If we compare this to another scenerio where the assignment pertains less information, but actually interests the student, then the student will definetely walk away with much more knowledge than they did before. Because of this, students should be able to design their own summer projects.\n \n Many people think that if students design their own summer projects, then they will just goof around and try to pick a very easy topic. This is arguable, as teachers can easily set boundaries for their students and have certain requirements such as having a minimum word count, page count, etc. All in all, students can have a good time and gain plently of knowledge if they are able to design their own summer project.Â",

      "Summer projects must be designed by teachers or the whole thing will be pointless. It is said there are many contraversial points that would lead folks to not taking a side on whether students should design summer projects, or if teachers should. However, projects need to be designed and assigned by teachers because it will set the standard of validation, express uniqueness and diversity, and reduce chances of cheating.\n \n First, having summer projects designed by teachers sets the tone on what the outcome should look like and how well a student must do. This prevents student's from simply waiting until the last week of summer and sloppily making a project that is eventually accepted by a teacher. Also, this action will assure the continued process of students learning while on summer break. The whole point of summer projects is so the students keep their minds fresh and ready for the next year, and If the students design the projects, that may not happen.\n \n Next up, teachers will find expressions of uniqueness and diversity in the results they recieve from the students. Every kid is different, and a teacher should be able to recognize that kids best interests and strongest characteristics. With that being known, teachers can design and assign summer projects accordingly. With every kid either working on a project that includes something they are comfortable with, or something they might need to work on more to be successful. This also reveals the different mindsets and creative skills a classroom holds, while a student designed project may just be basic and super boring.\n \n Last, the amount of cheating is bound to decrease when projects are designed by students. If a kid designed his own project over a span of a couple months, there's a big possibility he may cheat. These kids may also \"accidentally\" choose the same topic to work on all summer. There are endless possibilities and ways for a students to get away with the easy way out. Which is why, when a teacher assigns different topics and types of projects to a wide variety of students, it reduces cheating. This ultimately does help the students learn how to try new things, even if they aren't familier with it.\n \n Although this may be true, many believe that when teachers assign and or design summer projects for students, it will come out boring and no fun. People also believe it won't bring out the creative side in a student. But, the understanding of a student being creative and crafty is how they handle something that is thrown at them. The creativeness that lies in a student is how they can transform something out of their interest into something they can enjoy. Teacher designed projects bring out the capability of a kid and what that kid can truly do.\n \n All in all, summer projects are genuinely more productive and useful when designed by a teacher. It gives the students a chance to be creative and show unique skills, reduces the amount of unloyal actions such as cheating and working together, and it sets the standard for a student to meet. To all teachers who will read this, I advise you to keep the power in your hands. Bring out that student's inner strengths and challenge that student. One day, that student will thank you for not letting them take the easy way out.",

      "Summer projects keep the mind sharp. However often tedious, summer projects can often be beneficial as it can prepare the students for the following year or preferebly life. Some believe that these projects should be teacher designed so that students have the base kowledge on what will be covered that year, however that's not what learning is about. Learning is a life long journey not a journey to the next test. If these summer projects were student designed, where students had the freedom to choose, they could work on a something they truly found interesting. These projects could give them life experience rather than school experience.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects can be anything from work experiece to writing a noval. For example if a student loved to write and thought they may have a carreer as a jounalist or even an author they may decide their time was best spent on sharpening those skills. Not only would their time be spent to make themselves a better writer but also they would excited to do the work. However what if a student decides to make their project a job or even an internship at some law firm, well that is even better. These students will come back to school with more maturity, life experience and perhaps some money in the bank.\n \n Another outcome of student designed summer projects is rather than coming back the school with dred and resentment, they'll come back excited to showcase what they've learned. For example if teachers assigned a massive work load on everything they might need to pass the tests during the year, students will be anxious, unmotivated and stressed by the first day of school. This would kill students desire to learn and cause resentment towards teachers. However, if students can come back to school with the confidence that they are able to learn and experiece things by themselves, students will come into school postive and inspired to learn rather than being negative and unmotivated.\n \n Finally, there is a difference between schooling and learning. Schooling is a soley a tool to educate individuals however it is temporary. Learning is rather a life long jouney, something that should never stop. There is learning before school such as when you learned to walk and talk for the first time and then there is learning after school when you get a job or simply when you read a book. That is why summer projects should be the students responsibility, so that they can learn to learn by themselves. Sadly too many students believe that learning and schooling are the same thing and their life long jouney ends once they leave school.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects should be the students responsibility. These summer projects should inspire students to learn and experience new things. The goal is to have students motivated when they return to school rather than stressed and anxious for the year to end. Lastly learning is a life long jouney, schooling is temporary.",

      "One of the most truly modern American experiences has got to be voicing one's opinion on a subject they have little to know knowlege or experience with to the world. Unfortunately, today my opinion will not be voiced to the world as this is a SOL test, but it will be a scarecly informed opinion for sure. I have the privilige of never being assigned a project by a school over the summer, but today's prompt has drawn something to my attention that I never quite thought about before- That these summer projects assigned by schools should absolutely be designed by the students who have to do them as they can then be tailored to fit the students interests and schedules, within reason of course.\n \n Starting off positive, the most obvious pro of student designed summer projects is the creative liberty. Students would not only be free to pick whatever topic or subject they like, but the form their project takes. A student could go the conventional route and do a presentation with a trifold or something similar, or go in the opposite direction and hold a workshop explaining why purple light doesn't technically exist, complete with interactive features. They may even incorporate their other summer activities into their project, as a student traveling to France for the summer might research a part of French history and include their own photos that they took that relate to the topic. Speaking of other summer activities, students with jobs, internships, or anything else that may take up multiple hours of the day could then ensure that the project they give themself is something that they can handle.\n \n Now that I've explained all the wonderful pros of student designed projects, lets reign it back in a bit and disscuss the cons and some solutions to those cons along with my mildly valid expertise. I've been a girl scout since I was in elementary school and for the past few summers been doing research for a gold award project, the highest honor that a girl scout can earn. The main focus of a gold award is of course the project, which is designed entirely by the scout, may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year, and a proposal of said project has to be approved by a council.\n \n Granted, this is on a bit of a larger scale compared to a school summer project, but there are some good ideas that could be drawn from this. Approval of the project idea could ensure that the projects have genuine learning value, and could be approved by the student's counselor. Conselors would then also see to that students give themselves proper workloads, ensuring that they don't overwork themselves, or take the easy route either. Putting a deadline on the approval might also help encourage students to at least think about their project a bit before the night it's due. Gold awards also look good on college applications, and allowing students to make their projects something that they would be so proud of to put on a college application could be a boost in motivation for those college-bound.\n \n The concept of allowing students to have this much control over a project as we move towards an education system where the students are being allowed more control and freedom day by day can be truly great when done correctly. Which can absolutely happen, when necessary restraints are given. It simply requires more work on everyone's part, and considering that educational instititions are supposed to be preparing entire generations for life itself, and not just a workplace or university, that shouldn't be too hard? Perhaps I put too much faith in this but I truly do hope to see the day when students are proactive enough to go about these sorts of things on their own, not for a grade or award, but to better themselves and the world around them.",

      "Summer break is a long three months away from school for students to relax, learn new skills and enjoy themselves. Most students tend to forget everything they are taught throughout the school year over this break. Summer break to majority of students is time for having the best time of their lives doing all the things they love which hardly ever includes academic work. Teacher-designed summer projects would be a very 3 way to ensure students keep receiving knowledge throughout their summer break because education is a continuous process. Teachers would be the best choice to design these summer projects because they thoroughly know the syllabus of the course they teach, they would give realistic projects students can complete on time and teachers would be fair in selecting the type and criteria of the project.\n \n Teachers have all the information about the courses they teach and what their students need to know each year. Teacher-designed projects would entail the necessary topics and lessons for students to work on during their summer break. Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students. Students might also just want to create projects that would be very easy to complete just so they can get it over with. At the end of the day if students are allowed to create their own projects they end up learning nothing new because it was based on stuff they already knew. For example a Geometry teacher teaching tenth graders would not create a math project for tenth grade students based on sixth grade math because that is way below them.\n \n With teacher designed-projects they are more likely to have realistic amount of work and would be possible for students to complete and meet the goal at the end of the break, teachers would most definitely not give too much work to overburden students since they also need some rest or too little work to students but give them just enough work for the break. But if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge. A teacher who teaches a 12th grade English class could give a summer project for students to read and summarize a book of their choice and find out the meanings of 20 new words in the book but students would have probably wanted a project where they just write out ten new words from the book they read.\n \n Every student always wants the easy way out of everything so if allowed to create a summer project would just create a project based on what they are very good at for example; a project with artwork, a crossword puzzle or a project about their own sentences and this would lead to a disagreement among the students to pick the best project which would be good for everyone. However, a teacher would not be biased in choosing a summer project for their students, they would assign a project based on skills all their students are expected to know or already have without picking out what some particular people would want in that class.\n \n Ultimately, teachers know the best approaches and methods when it comes to projects for their students because they have worked with many different students over the years and came up with very 3 teacher-designed summer projects to help their students keep learning over the break without stressing them.

      "During the school year, a student completes set projects and curriculum in order to pass the classes which they are enrolled in. Over the summer, however, some schools require that projects should be assigned to students so that they continue to learn. I think that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students.\n \n Student designed projects will allows students to explore new fields that they may be interested in. If students are able to design their own summer projects, then they are able to choose a topic that is interesting to them for this project. This will allow the student to explore, research, and experiment within new fields. This exploration and research of new fields is very beneficial because it helps students find a career path based on what topics they are interested in.\n \n Having student-designed summer projects will inspire creativity. If a student is able to create their own project without need of a rubric or teacher to guide them, then this project is truly coming from the student. This will allow students to really show themselves when completing these projects. If students are just given a teacher-designed project, they are just following a rubric and completing what the teacher wants them to do. This work can be numb and boring for the students who could be using all their creativity on their own self-designed project.\n \n Student-designed projects will take away a lot of the stress that some students have during normal teacher-designed projects. Students will be less focused on doing everything right since the project is designed by them. These students will instead be able to focus on learning the material instead of stressing over getting a good grade. This will improve both the students mental health and the value in learning the student is actually receiving from a project.\n \n Schools should allow these summer projects to be student-designed. Although some may argue that teacher-designed projects are better because it guarantees that a student will learn a specific curriculum, student-designed summer projects have so many more benefits. I believe that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students",

      "The summer project is something that often looms over the minds' of students. We often find students bellyaching about how they are missing out on fun summer activities. More often than not, it is the teachers who assign the projects, and even though teachers are more educated on certain subjects, it would be appropriate to believe that students should design summer projects. This sort of activity over the summer would promote individuality, entrepreneurship, and personal responsibility.\n \n Some people think that individuality is not necessary in an industrial world, but really, it is the backbone of this nation and student designed projects promote such individuality. In the long term, individuality leads to higher paying jobs in the future. It is well known that if more people have high paying jobs, there will be less homelessness and a stimulated economy. As well, creativity stems from a sense of individuality. Fine arts are the future of the world as we are getting closer to not needing hard labor. The arts also jump startÂ economic progress by putting more money into the system. All this individuality leads to entrepreneurship.\n \n There is an argument to be made that not all students will be entrepreneurs, but it is important to nurture entrepreneurial practices, which can be done through aforementioned student designed projects. Entrepreneurs tend to be better off in the real world. This may sound repetitive, but we really need more people with big ideas so that the world can progress. The loss of this kind of person means the loss of all those years spent building the world from the ground up. As well, the process of designing a project could lead to students designing a business in the future. The process for creating such projects is quite involved, and it leads to more focused adults in the future. In reality though, none of this would be possible without a sense of personal responsibility.\n \n Many people in this modern world believe that the only way to become more responsible is to get a job, and while this is partially accurate, projects such as this will always nurture responsibility. For example, completion of projects lead to the student feeling more accomplished. That sense of accomplishment make students feel like accomplishing more will make them feel even better, leading to them being more responsible with projects in their future. As well, project planning in youth will lead to the individual taking charge within projects in their future. It is important to have students be proactive in their career as it will likely lead to better positions and better pay.\n \n To finish, responsibility will only develop if you let your student take charge, be it in a career or in a project. While some people may disagree, this is the truth, hard work cannot do all the heavy lifting. As a country we need to develop our youths' sense of entrepreneurship,individuality, and personal responsibility or else we will not progress as a people.",

      "Students-designed projects should always be assigned even during the school year. Students-design are more understandable that teacher-design. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students.\n \n Even though, teacher-design projects will be able to test our knowledge. They are not made for children the way a student- design would be. Student- design projects will relate to students more because it will be base around us. We will have total control, unlike how sum teacher-design projects have rules and guidelines that stop us from being fully open. For, example i had to do a essay about my summer adventures. I chose to write about the time i visited my grandparents in Florida. A few days went by and my teacher wanted to talk to me. She wanted me to rethink my essay because she did not feel any excitement reading it. I didn't agree with her because i always had fun with my grandparents. We would feed the sea turtles, go on night walks at the beach, and go to the board walk's carnival. She still felt as if i wasn't meet the project requirements. This project played a important role in my grade, so i accepted it and rewrote my essay.\n \n In addition student-based projects will show how creative we are. This will give students the opportunity to show off their talent and ideas. Teacher- designed projects do not always allow students to show what they are fully capable of, it only shows what they want to see. Such as, my friend Generic_Name had to do a portraitÂ for her finals in art. She sketched an amazing portrait with a lotÂ of details, so she could show her skills off. This was very risky, to much detail could throw the sketch off. Her adviser thought that she should do something simple to ensure she will get an easy A. Generic_Name wanted more that a easy grade, she wanted her artwork to inspire people and toÂ make a mark, so she went with her idea instead. Now her paint is hanging in the museum of art and is displayed every month downtown.\n \n Next, Student-designed projects will be way more fun and entertaining for students. Every year we receive projects that are boring and does not interest us. Teacher-designed project have no personality and are way to formal. Students-designed projects can be more funny, silly and excited, it can bring happiness back to school projects. For example, two teachers, Generic_Name and Generic_Name assigned the same project. Generic_Name gave her students a teacher-designed project, but Generic_Name didnt. She let her students chose their own project and gave them a rubric of what she would be looking for. Generic_Name class's project still related to science but was personalized. It showed that they really tried and had fun doing this project. She had never seen so many smiles on students faces as they presented their projects. It showed her that she made the right chose.\n \n In conclusion, these are all the reason why we should get student-designed projects. It is showed that student- designed projects can help and motivate students. Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students. In the end this will be the best for students.",

      "Most schools require students to complete summer projects. Over the years, there has been a debate if these programs should be student-taught or teacher- taught. Summer projects should be teacher- designed because, teachers have a greater knowledge of the subject, are trained to keep kids engaged, and know how to plan a lesson that students can relate to worldly.\n \n Teachers all around the world study the subject(s) that they teach. This gives them greater knowledge than any student would have. Most teachers are required to graduate college, and get a teaching degree as well, (some teachers even get their masters). That is more years of studying a single subject than any high schoolÂ studentÂ may have. Studying this single subject for many years, gives them a lot of experience, and specific knowledge to help educate a student on the subject. Although students can always learn the material, they may not have as great of knowledge as a teacher on one specific subject. Teachers have at least four years of knowledge that a students don't and thats why they're better teachers than a student.\n \n Along with four years of college, teachers must receive a teaching degree. While studying for this degree, teachers learn how to plan out lessons, and keep kids engaged. A teacher would better keep kids engaged, because they are trained to keep kids focused, and keep them involved in the material they learn in class. Weather this is; keeping kids involved in class by doing a project that is hands on, or having them start conversation to create development of their skills and knowledge. Some may argue that students would keep kids more engaged, due to how they can relate to kids their own age, teachers can relate to students too. Teachers know what its like to goo through schooling, because they had to do it too. Teachers are trained to keep students entertained, and develop their skills inside and out of the classroom.\n \n Most teachers enjoy learning about their subject they teach daily, this keeps their material relevant and reputable. Making sure that the teachers material is relevant, helps kids from around the world be able to relate to the lessons. Mr. Generic_Name, is a second grade teacher at Generic_School. Over the summers he likes to practice his teaching, by traveling the world to see if his material is still relevant in other countries. Many teachers will do this to ensure that what theyre teaching their class is resignatingÂ with each student. Keeping teachers' content relevant is a sure way to keep kids relating to the topic.\n \n Summer rprojects should be relatable, engaging, and well taught. That's why Teachers should teach Summer Projects. They've had years of experince, teachers can relate to kids, keep them engaged, and create lessons that relate to the world. Teachers are the best fit to direct summer projects.Â",

I believe summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.\n \n My first reason on why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows the student to be more involvedÂ in what there learning. For example if a student receives a summer project from he or she's teacher it's highly likely that the project will be focused on everything that the student has learned before the summer. But what if the student dose not need to learn everything what if they only need to focus on certain thing that they are struggling with that's why I believe that student-designed projects would benefit students better; because it give them the opertuntitieÂ to create a project that can focus on things that they are struggling with and improve upon it.\n \n Another reason I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it allows students learn at there own speed and level. I personally believe that the summer projects that are given to student are pretty challenging and a lotÂ of students and because of this a lotÂ of student either decides not to do the project or they cheat and end up not learning anything; thats why I feel so strongly that student should be allowed to choose and designed there own projects i believe this will help students learn without being overwhelmedÂ or overly challenged. On the other hand teacher may feel that if theyÂ designed the projects that it will be better for students and they also may feel that overly challenging students is a good thing because it put students in a position to challenge themselves and to learn at a higher level; and while statement has a pointÂ I still have to disagree because while its true that some students may benefit from this there are still a lot of students who wont I believe that a student my first master the level that there at now in order to proceed into a higher level of education.\n \n These are all the reasons i believeÂ summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be more involved in what there learning and it also allows students to learn at there own speed and level.Â Â",

      "Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.\n \n Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.\n \n Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.\n \n Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",

      "Researchers say, if people take a few month break from something, they will most likely forget it and will have to relearn it. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. People debate on whether the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would allow the student to be more creative, do a project they would enjoy, and gives students more independence.\n \n If students were to be required to make a summer project and it was student-designed, it would let students be more creative. Most teachers and parents want their student/child to think outside the box. A student led project would make students use their brain more, during their 2 month long break of not doing anything. The project would allow students to develop an independent mind. They would give a nudge for students to get out of their comfort zone. The project would make students think more independently at a younger age. As they get older, they will be more inclined to do things out of their comfort zone. Supporting a student to lead his summer project would make the next generation more creative.\n \n A student led summer project would allow students to pick a topic they would enjoy. Majority of people will produce quality work if they have a passion for it. People like to work on projects they enjoy and can open their minds to. If someone likes a subject they will most likely want to pursue that subject. Some students will find the topics a teacher gives them boring and unmotivating. This is due to the fact that one person cannot satisfy everyone in the room. If a student doesn't like a topic they will not enjoy it and it will not accurately represent their academic skills. Allowing students to lead their own summer projects, means they will pick something they will enjoy and have a passion for.\n \n Doing a student led summer project would give students more independence. Students would have to take more responsibility. If a student were to do bad on a project they would have to take responsibility for their actions. It would train the next generation to take responsibility instead of blaming someone else. This would give students more preparation for the adult life. They school system gives little to no preparation on how to manage an adult life, but it would give students a little more experience for the students. A project like this would give people a little nudge to grow up gradually. Summer projects would give more independence, if it was student led.\n \n Student led summer projects would, overall, allow students to be more creative, do something they enjoy, and give students more independence. The projects would mold students to take responsibility, think outside the box, and pursue something they enjoy and have a passion for.

      "Should schools require students complete summer projects during the summer? Honestly I think if your behind like at the end of the year you could do these summer projects to get you caught up, that would help a lot of students like me. I think they should be designed by the students after all it's our summer. I just dont think school should be pushing us like that we're to young for that. They already keep us in school for about eight or nine months then most students work really hard to get to where they need/want to be.\n \n Me personally, I would want the teachers to design the projects but only since its summer I would not be ok with that. Most students put in so much work just to get a couple more pointless projects during the summer at lease if the the students design it will be something simple, but not to simple. I already know if the teachers design it would be something that's so difficult and extra and it's the summer so they will say something like you had all the time in the world to complete this. But thats not how its supposed to be it should be something I could complete in a week or two. We shouldnt have to go to school for that long just to get stuck with some summer projects design by some teachers that probably dont even know me.\n \n Maybe if the teachers and the students designed the projects together we could come up with something. I would not care if it wasn't the summer but I can't lie projects in the summer would be smart. The only thing is I feel like the teacher would just throw something at us. If it was graded like extra credit or something when school start that would be way more motivation to get ahead way before school even start. Sometimes we just need a break, just a small one because we do so much in and out of school y'all teachers and staff don't know what goes on out of school, they never do.\n \n In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects but the teachers should check of on them to make sure they're not to easy. We work hard through out the school year just to get to the summer and i dont think it should be to hard for them or to long. During school, most teachers gives us little time to do the most difficultÂ projects in the school year, just like last year. Even tho we should be relaxing in the summer this is kind of a neat idea and would keep us on task for the next school year. We all can contribute to designing summer projects so we could stay focus.",

Others think it'll be a horrible assignment because the teacher is creating the requirements. If students really pay attention to what's happening they'll realize the teacher is making the class do less work compared to what students wanted. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they have more experience, they'll make sure the class covers new material, and it'll be easier for teachers to grade.\n \n Teachers know what results they want when it comes down to projects. They've went to college, learned about designing projects, and spent their time and money on being taught how to grade and make assignments. The school faculty know our strengths and weaknesses, what we need and what we don't, teachers have walked in our shoes. They know what students want before the students know.\n \n The schools number one priority is to teach and make students learn new information. Teachers know how to introduce new topics, ideas, and questions that'll force students to use their brain. They're aware of what children know and don't know. Teachers know that it would take too long for students to make their assignment because they haven't been taught how to grade or make a rubric to grade with.\n \n Having the teachers design the project will be easier for them to grade.

The school faculty know what we'll achieve and what we'll fail at, they making rubrics and grading systems designed for students.\n \n However, students would have fun inventing their own requirements for the assignment, but students just use what they already know.

      "Giving teachers an extra task like designing a summer based project can be hard or easy it really just depends on how you look at the situation. Teachers assignÂ projects all year, so this should be no different. There are many types of teachers that teach many different subjects that have to be remembered. Students are expected to learn numerous things in just one school year, so being assigned a summer project covering everything and adding in new topics can generate ideas for students and get them to researching on their own and teaching them selfÂ things they never knew. Teachers will be available for emails from students and or parents to ask for help or a guiding hand. A lot of the time students are asked questions by teachers throughout the school year on things they were not taught or on things they cannot remember, so being assigned a project that is in dept could save them from that one embarrassmentÂ in front of their classmates.\n \n First, students will be introduced to new topics in their project. This will get students to thinking and they will want to research since technology is the biggest thing right now. This will result in them participating and they will find out new information while completing their work. The new topics will help them learn stuff that is expected to be covered. The remembering will be first priority in their project. Students will have a variety of topics in each subject and they will be expected to complete it fully. No student is allowed to leave anything undone or uncompleted. Each student is encouraged to email their teacher or research the topics and find out any information, just saying they did not understand or they did not know what to put will be unacceptable.\n \n Secondly, every teacher will be expected to leave contact information to be reached. Students are only expected to contact their teacher for help on his or her project. This is given to every student but mainly for ones without internet. There are also students who do not have parents or anyone they can rely on to help them so the teachers information is there for anyone nobody is singled out. Parents that graduated years ago may not be able to include input to their children work because they were not taught the same or know many of the things students are taught now so they are more than welcome to contact teachers for any information pertaining to the subject, this will maybe even help parents learn something.\n \n Students should create their own projects to show what they learned all year and what they do not know. Not every child needs a guiding hand or someone to lead them in the right direction. Each student can come up with their own project to show that they remember important lessons from class meetings. The teachers should not have to take their summer time to email parents and students back about things they were taught while in school. On the other hand, few students make it to class everyday to be apart of the class discussionsÂ and are not allowed to hear the notes. A lot of the things that teachers go over during class is not put into the missing work folder. The teacher could have given out many really important points that any student could have easily not paid any attention to, misheard, or was not in class to hear. Being assigned this project can help many students learn new things or relearn something they probably did not understand.\n \n To conclude this, teacher-designed projects can not only benefit students it helps them relearn things they did not understand. Nobody is perfect and anyone is capable of not knowing the right information due to miscommunication. It is alright to ask for help if you do not understand it is recommend to students. Some things can be self taught, but still not fully understood. Having a teacher that is willing to put in the effort to help his or her students shows dedication and any student should be thankful and take the help. By the end of the school year students are probally burnt out with tons of work and this project could bring back so much information that was covered.Â",

      "Some schools will assign students projects over summer break to assure they will continue to learn school subjects. Summer is a long time and will give the students enough time to learn what is needed. There is a small debate as to whether the students or the teachers should design these projects. Although many teachers will assign and create these projects because they can make sure the students will learn what they need to learn, students should design these projects because many teachers will give to big of a project, many students might not have enough time to work on said project, and giving the student the ability to create the project will assure it can get done.\n \n The first reason to support this claim is that teachers may give to big of a project. Normally, teacher will give a student a project to work on and learn but there is no telling how big that project could be. The teacher could say to create 1 deck of study cards or to write a 10 page essay on something that student may not have learned about. And many times the student may not get the project done in a way the teacher likes because they did not get a chance to go over something like that. Lastly, sometimes the student can get anxious or nervous about having to create a project as big or small as the teacher assigns.\n \n Secondly, a student may not have the time to work on a big project. Teachers look forward to the summer just as much as kids do. Summer is a time to hang out with family or earn some money at a job. Many students simply will not have enough time to worry about creating a big school project. Everyone has responsibilities, like work, family, or just household tasks, and lots of people can not make enough time to work on summer projects. Also depending on how big the assigned project will be and how many teachers assign projects can be to much and give a student not enough time to complete them all.\n \n Lastly, if a students designs a project they can make it so that it can revolve around their schedule. A teacher will normally give students a big project and expect it to be done without thinking about how a student has a life outside of school just like a teacher. For the majority of students, they are too busy with summer responsibilities to be able to work on a teacher assigned school project. If a student is given the right to create their own project, following some small steps from the teacher, there is a higher chance that the student will get the project done rather than not complete it.\n \n In conclusion, students should be able to assign and create their own projects. Many reasons include how big the project is, how much time it will take, and how much time the student can work on it. So to make it easier on everyone, students should be able to make their own projects that can revolve around their own lives and responsibilities.Â",

      "Summer is the time of year where students all over the world finally get to relax. They do not have to worry about any responsibilities; they can just remember what it means to be a kid. However, some schools are allowed to assign projects over summer. If kids are required to constantly be thinking about school and work, they should at least be enjoying it. Students should self design any projects assigned over summer because its their own free time, everyone has unique learning styles, and teachers aren't always considerate.\n \n Children care about their summer vacations, because it is the only time they are truly free. A student looks forward to this vacation throughout the whole school year. They wait patiently, completing every assignment and every test, just so they can play outside in the summer sunshine. These kids don't want to finally get out of school to only have to complete yet another assignment. If the kids are having to do this project on their own break, they should at least be able to choose what they do. For example, if a student is assigned a project over summer from biology, they should be able to pick to do an animal studies on their own dog. An animal they know well, love, and actually would enjoy researching. Kids having to spend their vacation working should be able to choose what to work on.\n \n Kids want to play, so they should be able to and have a project that adapts to their learning style. Every student learns differently. Having a project created by one teacher would be unfair to everyone else who doesn't think the same way. Allowing students to have some decision in what they do would be most 3 in actually teaching them. Every mind learns differently and needs creative thinking involved to begin working. If kids were allowed to come up with their own projects, it would be much better than a teacher-designed project. The kids would not think of it as homework, but instead as something they want to do.\n \n Teachers don't always know whats best for their students. Many teachers may just assign homework because they need more grades in the grade book. They don't always consider if it's necessary for the students learning. They don't think about the stress that homework inflicts on it's victims. If teachers were to create a project for students to complete over summer, it would cause lots of stress and resentment. Although, letting the kids design their own projects would help build a better bond between kids and learning. Teachers would then get a better feel for each student and see how each of their individual minds work. Letting kids design their own projects would also reduce the amount of work and stress teachers have to endure. Having to come up with a project that would be easy for every student to complete is hard as it is. Having to do this before a teachers own vacation is just torture. It would be a win win situation if the kids got to design the project.\n \n If it was required that a kid got a summer project, it should be student designed. Kids are not thrilled about getting homework over their vacation, and they may not put their best effort. However, If the kids had the option to create their own project it would spark much more creativeness. Teachers would better understand their students and get a break from all the regulating. Both students and teachers would benefit from a student-designed project.",

    essay:
      "Are students responsible enough to design their own school projects? Numerous schools require students to complete projects over the summer to ensure learning, but this method may be 1. If students were given the freedom to design their own projects it would lead to greater performance due to the likelihood that students will pick topics that interest them, that projects would be generalized to help students in the fields with which they require assistance, and the possibility of students forgetting about the project would be lower if they actively worked on it.\n \n However, some may disagree with this viewpoint. Some may say that designing their own projects provides students with an opportunity toÂ pick an easy topic with which they will not be challenged. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.\n \n Firstly, students, when given the opportunity, will always choose to work on a topic that interests them. Studies show that working with a topic that interest them improves the performance of students while also increasing the possibility of them making an effort to complete their work. However, this is not the only reason why students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Additionally, while some may argue that students would choose to work on topics which they find easy, the chance of a class of students all thriving in the same subjects is highly improbable. Due to the fact that some students will choose to work in subjects which they don't find challenging, students may end up choosing topics which challenge their peers and inadvertently create a project which is all encompassing. But these are not the only reasons students should design their own summer projects.\n \n Finally when any person puts considerable effort into something it causes information related to the subject becomes learned more easily. This is one of the reasons why teachers use methods such as taking notes to reinforce what students are learning. So, logically a group of students working together to choose a topic and subject which they are all satisfied with will reinforce the knowledge of such a project and therefore decrease the likelihood that students will forget about their summer projects thereby improving results.\n \n However, there are many more reasons that students should design their own summer projects.\n \n InÂ conclusion, students should have a hand in creating their own summer projects to choose topics which interest them, as well as to increase the likelihood of them completing said projects, and finally create a project in which all students may both thrive and struggle.",

      "Summer projects should be student-designed. No student likes to do projects in the summer, Students will require motivation and excitement. If students can design their own project, they can be different and more creative. Students enjoy tasks where there's no limit as to what they can do; it gives them the opportunity to try something new. This gives teachers less work and students a more thoughtful tasks. Overall, this will give students a reason to learn, even during they're break.\n \n This is a good way to assure students are still learning. It also gives the students more of a challenge and prepare them for the following school year. Students can use this as a way to see how they're doing and also to stay involved in school. If it were a teacher-designed project, most students wouldnt participate. Since the students are the ones designing it, it'll give them a little more excitement and control over the project.\n \n Students tend to work harder and be more creative when it is a self-designed project. This will open more opportunities and more ideas. Designing your own project gives students the freedom and control that they love. For example, the few times I've been able to design my own project I always put forth more effort and creativity; This is because students love to try different things and be in control. This is important because it teaches students valuable skills that they may need in the real world.\n \n If students are interested and have ideas, summer projects can be really beneficial. Allowing students to create their own project is a great way to interest them. Students tend to work best when they have their own ideas, it's a lot easier and gives the student more freedom. This can teach students to be more independent and hardworking.\n \n A project can show effort and knowledge, when students create their own it shows their best work. It allows students to show what they are capable of. That is why I believe students should design their own project. Â Â",

      "Throughout the school year, both staff and students await summers warm arrival. As the incoming heat and sunscreen draws the final semester to an end, the dreaded thoughts of summer projects spread. Whether it be summer-readings or instructional packets, several high schools urge, if not require, teachers to assign summer projects to assure continuous learning over the two month break. Recently, however, students have debated that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. Designing their own projects would allow students to pursue topics they interest, the creative freedom that makes their projects unique, and ensure each students ability to complete projects with the resources available to them.\n \n Often times students are required to complete a project they lack interest in. A 2013 study confirms that when students are given the opportunity to design individual assignments, they are 78% more inclined to participate and are confident of their final product. If a particular student is interested in basketball, they would be more willing to read a book and write an accompanying paper about its history rather than Mary Shelly's\n \n Frankenstein . A students eagerness to learn in specific topics strengthens their work and ensures their growth and success before the new school year.\n \n Equally as important as topic diversity is topic delivery. Reading a book and writing a paper confirming your completion year after year does little to stimulate a students brain. Offering students the creative freedom to complete their summer project will further invest them into their topic. Say a student is interested in film and designs their project on studyingÂ its evolution; instead of writing a paper, the student could make a video presentation featuring different clips and information. Allowing students to broaden their horizons will encourage critical thinking and result in a more stimulated head spaceÂ when returning to school.\n \n Another important consideration is whether or not students can access the necessary resources to complete a teacher-designed project. Several high school students are not fortunate enough to purchase a summer-reading book, supplies for a poster board, or the internet to construct a paper. When completing the project isn't a viable option, the opportunity to design their own allows them to use resources already available to them and avoid lowering their grade.\n \n Although student-designed summer projects are proven to aid learning in more ways than one, schools are still hesitant to make the shift. Teachers rebuttal saying teacher-designed projects would provide students with relevant prepÂ work for their next course and avoid any inappropriate topics that fail to exhibit student growth. Students agreed and offered to solve the inevitable conflict: students have the option of of either completing a teacher-designed project or designing and their own as long as it is teacher-approved prior to schools end.\n \n Maintaining academic activity is key to achieving higher grades and retaining long termÂ information. Even in the summer, students should practice this with assigned summer projects. Though teacher-designed projects aid a students transition into the next year, these projects can be repetitive and may struggle to entice or stimulate students. When students themselves design one, however, the passion for their topics, creative delivery, and avoiding any hindrance on unavailable necessities allow them to learn while still fulfilling what summer is all about: having fun!",

      "Summer break. The most sought after break by any student at any level. Days spent by the pool, hours of hanging with friends, and nights that run into the morning. Summer is where all knowledge learned during the previous year goes down the drain. To counter this, teachers assign summer projects. These projects are normally easy but require much time. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they prepare the student for the next year, the teacher knows what is being taught, and it gives the student a baseline of what he or she knows.\n \n Summer projects are designed by a teacher that the student will have next year. These projects need to incorporate what will happen in the upcoming year. Many first units include what was included in the summer project. Summer projects help student get ready for the new year by giving students an easy, slow paced, and minimal effort project that will help students in the long run. These projects are often worth points and can boost grades when quarters or semesters are ending.\n \n Teachers know what is being taught for the next year. They can design the assignment to reflect what will happen. Students can't do that. They don't know what is going to be taught or how the teacher teaches. If a student were to design the project, they would make it have little to no relation to the upcoming class. Students during the summer are lazy, I speak from experience, and the last thing they want to do is school work. When they design their own work, it is sloppy; lazy; and unrelatedÂ to the class.\n \n Lastly, the summer project gives an honest and unbiased evaluation of what the student already knows and what they don't know. The assignment is students' first test, and students can give themselves an honest evaluation of themselves. How much did I have to Google? Did I ask my friends for help? How long did it take me? These are all questions that they can ask themselves. These questions and project will show how much work they will need to put in during the school year.\n \n Some might say that students can prepare themselves betterÂ for the school year than the teacher can. They don't need to have the teacher to assign them work. The weakness in that argument is that students are over confident in their abilities on what the know and don't know. As a student in high school, I constantly believe that I am smarter than I truly am. Students will think they know more than they really do and will already be behind before the school year starts.\n \n Teachers design these projects to help and prepare the student. It gives an honest evaluation of students' abilities and knowledge. More teachers should assign summer projects to keep students' brains engaged. This helps them prepare for the next year while also seeing what the teacher wants. The teacher knows the subject better than the student; teachers should assign summer projects not students.Â",

      "Benefits of Student-designed Projects\n \n Summer projects are to keep students learning during summer break but most kids don't find the projects entertaining. Student-designed projects can improve their creativity and make them want to complete the project. Also, teachers will be more excited and looking forward to seeing the outcome of students work. Schools should really think about making more projects student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because more students will want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem.\n \n In schools, participation from students is very important and student-designed summer projects are a great way to increase excitement and participation. If students could come up with their own projects and enjoy the work that they are doing, plenty of other students will want to do the project. In addition, students will see their peers coming up with their own kind of project and will want to join in by making a project themselves. For example, a student can see one of their friends making a project and can tell that the friend is having fun while doing it. This will encourage the student to join in on the student-designed project and make them want to do the project more. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Secondly, student-designed projects can increase creativity throughout students. Projects already help with creativity but having a student design a project can really increase it. For example, my art teacher had the class come up with different ideas for our next piece of art work. There were so many creative thoughts going around that my teacher had us make our own unique thing. As I worked on the project, I could really see my creative side show and everybody else's too. Having students design their own projects for the summer is really good for the next school year. For instance, students developing and finding out how creative that can be will improve grades and talent. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Self-esteem is an important factor in the real world, having students design a project can help them improve their confidence. A student knowing that they completed a project, they've made, will make them proud of themselves. In addition, using the project in other classes, and getting recognized for designing a good project will drastically increase their self-esteem. Students-design summer projects will increasingly let students know that they can do any thing they put their minds too. Self-confidence will provide students with better outcomes, motivation and even they will feel more confident in the work they are putting out. In this paragraph, I proved that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Some opponents believe that teacher-designed projects should be used for summer projects. Also, they may feel as if it will be easy on students and a better way of learning. However, giving students a easy way isn't always the best thing to do. Having students design a project has better outcomes in the long run. For example, having a teacher design a project and give it to students may not help students become more creative or participate or even gain self-esteem from it. So, a teacher-design project for the summer, in my eyes, is not the best thing to have students grow and improve in certain positions.\n \n In conclusion, keeping students active and learning during the summer by having student-design projects has plenty of benefits. In addition, this can have a better impact on students as well as be more exciting and entertaining to students. Three benefits for student-design summer projects are it will make students want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.Â Â",

      "When we think of break, whether it's Spring, Summer or Winter, we tend to think of it as something where we can relax after a long period of work or school, however, during these breaks, many of us play sports, have jobs or preform other activities during this time off. It's important to keep in mind that many students preform various activities when discussing a summer assignment. Some schools offer up this assignments, that way students are able to learn during break. The question isn't whether summer assignments are necessary or not, because having prior knowledge going into a class is important, but rather the question is whether the summer assignments should be be comprised of questions made by teachers or questions made by students. Having questions created by students, will make the summer assignments much more useful.\n \n If you ask any student who pays attention in a certain class about the way they feel about that class, they're sure to give you a wide array of emotions that they felt toward certain topics or units. For example, if you ask a student their thoughts on unit 7, they are able to tell you if it was hard or easy and if it was on the difficult side, they would be able to tell you what kind of questions confused them. having this foresight is very important when creating questions, you are able to give other students more exercises for the questions you think are more difficult.\n \n Another reason why it is more beneficial for students to create summer assignments rather than teachers, is because teachers tend to over prepare students which could become damaging. \"Overprepare\" can mean that you know the bare minimum and more, which does apply to teachers summer assignments, however, knowing too much unnecessary information can make you forget important information. Overcrowding summer assignments with non vital knowledge can also be discouraging to students, and it will make them not want to attempt the work.\n \n Overall, having student created questions will benefit other students taking that class, because, at the end of the day, students understand what it's like to be a student. A student is not just a person who attends a form a schooling but an actual person. Students need time for sports, jobs they may have, or even just socializing and hanging out with friends. Other people who understand these struggles, should be the ones who ultimatley be in control of the questions.",

      "As a child, I, as well as most others, desperately counted the days until summer break. In the classroom, we had a bright, beach themed poster boardÂ with the school days remaining plastered in big, bold letters in the middle. On my sports teams, we always had fun and easy practices during the last week of school. I always looked forward to summer, especially when everyone else was so enthusiastic about it. However, this changed as I got older when I was introduced to summer assignments. They felt like the exact opposite of summer. They were boring and restrictive, so I always procrastinated doing them until the very end. Today, many school systems are looking to implement summer projects, as they can help tackle the lost and wasted time during the summer. Simultaneously, it is important that schools don't impose overly restrictive projects that take away what it means to be on summer break. One solution to this is to implement student-designed projects. These allow students to create what they want their summer project to be. Although many may say teacher-designed summer projects better preserve the students' learning, student-designed projects are overall superior because they give more freedom, creativity, and flexibility for the students during their summer break.\n \n Student-designed summer projects are a phenomenal chance to give students more freedom and let them be creative. In school, students have very few opportunities to express their creativity, so summer break is seen by many as a chance to break away from overly structured school days. Forcing students to follow a teacher-designed project will only remove its specialty, and further limit chances students have to be creative. On the other hand, student-designed projects could be the spark needed by some to make use of their summer. Additionally, if students feel the teacher-designed projects were too restrictive, there is a chance they would put as little effort into them as possible, or forgo them entirely. If this happens, it is a waste of time for both the student and the teacher. In my own experience, I have seen that most summer assignments had very little or no impact on my grade, so it often made far more sense not to do them. However, when teachers did try to tie these assignments to a grade, lots of students and parents complained. Whereas, when students are able to design a project about something they are passionate about, this is far less likely to happen, and could even lead to further interest about that topic.\n \n Another important aspect of summer projects is the various time restraints every student has. Students may have sports, vacations, jobs, and many other activities. Designing a project which accommodates everyone's complex and ever-changing needs can be impossible. By allowing students to design the project, much of this problem is eliminated. They know the time they have better than anyone else, so they can design a project which fits far better to their own schedule. If students were able to design their own projects, they could even tie it into the activities they're already doing. This way, they're able to gain the benefits of a summer project, while not having to change much about their summer. Not having enough time is another reason why some students may not do their summer project, but can have other, additional, consequences. With a teacher-designed project, if students don't have the time to complete it, they may look towards cheating off of others, since everyone is following the same project. This not only negates any benefits of a summer project, but can also lead to some downsides. If a student cheats on a summer project because they didn't have the time to do it, they may feel encouraged to cheat again in the future, even if they wouldn't have otherwise. With a student-designed project, cheating is much less of a problem. Not only are there far fewer reasons to cheat, but it's much harder to as well, since every student has their own project, they can't simply copy off of what someone else has done.\n \n Many people may say that teacher-designed projects would be far better to maintain students' learning and allow them to learn new things, but this is untrue. It is far easier for students to learn new things if it's about a topic they're interested about; whereas, students may not absorb any knowledge about a topic they have no interest in. Even if student-designed projects were worse for learning, their other benefits still outweigh their downsides. Student-designed projects are a great way to develop creativity, and they let students with naturally high creativity use it, which they aren't given many chances to in school. Student-designed projects are also much better for students' time constraints, which will encourage more students to do the project.\n \n As more school systems begin to adopt summer projects, it is crucial that these projects are student-designed. Summer projects are important to build and preserve learning from throughout the year, but are extremely limiting on students freedom, creativity, and flexibility.Â By giving students the capability to design their own projects, it restores much of what is lost by giving them summer work. Student-designed projects also help to avoid many of the possible downsides of teacher-designed ones. Because of the lack of freedom and the inability to tailor a project to everyone schedule, teacher-designed projects can often lead to students cheating, or not doing the work at all. By putting students in the driver's seat of their own project, they can find a project that is enjoyable and encourages themselves to do it. By using student-designed projects, schools can obtain the needed balanced between a useful summer and an enjoyable one.",

      "Summer break is the biggest part of the year that students look forward to. Students want to have fun with friends and just relax, however, students are still required to continue learning throughout their break in order to retain information they've learned over the school year. Consequently, students are assigned teacher-designed summer projects. Some people may say that teacher-designed summer projects are 3, however, student-designed projects are better because it would be more enjoyable for the students and it will have more diverse topics.\n \n First of all, having students design their ownÂ projects would be a lot more enjoyable for students because they have the freedom to choose their own topics. For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated.\n \n Secondly, letting students design their projects will lead to more diverse topics. Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions. In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic. This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from bothÂ sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other. Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another.\n \n Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students, however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education. For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or notÂ enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the freedom to choose and design their own summer projects because it'll give the students a chance freely express themselves. Students today have a lot of information thrown at them during the school year and having to retain all that information throughout summer is very difficult, but having students forcefully research and learn about a topic they don't like would be very discouraging and not very 3. Learning is an important part of life, but students should still have the freedom to research and work on something they want to do.Â",

    essay:
      "Have you ever been assigned a project that you did not want to work on? This regularly happens to many students, due to a variety of reasons. Although summer projects are slightly different than those assigned during the school year, they cause similar problems. The student might have been lazy, did not have enough time to work on the project, or the topic did not interest them. While schools cannot help much with the former two reasons, they can with the latter reason. Teacher-designed projects can be biased, affecting the student's ability to gain a wide understanding of a topic. Additionally, teachers tend to assign projects on topics that students do not see much importance in, as the topic does not seem to affect the student in any way. For these reasons, summer projects should be student-designed to allow students to be more passionate about the project, be creative, and be more self-reliable.\n \n Student-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic they are working on, causing them to work efficiently. When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, they are not usually excited to work on the assignment. Additionally, they do not value it as important, leaving the work until the last minute. For example, in 7th grade, my Life Science class was assigned a project about the deer population in Virginia. Many of the students did not actively work on the project, as they found the topic boring. Because they did not understand the relevance of the topic, the students were not passionate about the project. An independent project assigned in my AP Lang class, however, had a different result. The assignment was to write a research paper on a social issue that interested us. Because students were able to write about an issue that interests them, they actively worked on the project. Being passionate about a project also affects a student's performance in class. For example, because the majority of the class was not passionate about the deer project, they did not do well on it. However, on the AP Lang assignment, the majority of the class did well on related assignments, as they were passionate about the projects they worked on.\n \n Summer projects designed by students allow for creativity. Students are able to express themselves, as they are not restricted by strict guidelines the way they are with teacher-designed projects. Because of this reason, students are more likely to actively work on the project and put in more effort. For example, my AOS biology class was assigned a project to research and present information about a group of proteins. We were allowed to present this information in any way we wanted, allowing for creativity. The majority of the students were very excited to work on the project, as they thought of fun ways to present their information. Some students created songs to relay their information, whereas others made fun videos to do so. A few students even baked cakes to provide information about their proteins. Each student actively worked on their project and put in effort to make sure it was done well. The element of creativity allowed the students to see the assignment as a fun project, rather than as a boring task. Because the majority of the students worked hard on the project, they did well on it. Furthermore, they 3ly retained the information they researched, allowing them to do well on the corresponding test.\n \n By allowing projects to be student-designed, schools allow students to develop a sense of self-reliance. This is because the students have to conduct their own research in order to find a topic that interests them, rather than just receive a topic from the teacher. For example, in elementary school, students come up with their own experiments to test, after which they present their findings at the science fair. By doing so, students learn how to depend on themselves to find information. Similarly, sophomores at the Generic_School take a research class. They work on a wide variety of projects that are mostly assigned by teachers, but towards the end of the year, they must come up with an independent research project that they will work on in their junior year. In order to choose their project, students have to conduct extensive research to understand the topic, as their project cannot have been done before. Additionally, they have to continue conducting research in junior year to allow for a wider understanding of the topic. This allows the students to be self-reliant, as they know more about their project than their teacher, who acts as a mentor. Self-reliance is a very important skill that helps people succeed in the community and workplace when they become an adult, so it is important to establish the skill early on.\n \n Some people may believe that allowing students to design their own projects creates more work for teachers, putting stress on them. The teachers cannot have a uniform grading rubric and must have enough background knowledge on each student's topic in order to grade them fairly. However, by allowing summer projects to be student-designed, teachers do not have to come up with a topic themselves. Additionally, they are exposed to a wide variety of projects, allowing them to be more interested in the presented material. This allows teachers to be more likely to grade the projects fairly, as they do not have to repeatedly look at the same information.\n \n In conclusion, self-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic, resulting in the creation of better projects. Students can demonstrate their creativity, allowing them to 3ly retain the learned information. They also become more self-reliant, which will help them when they get a job. Rather than assigning teacher-designed projects over the summer, schools should assign student-designed projects to stimulate learning, as well as shape students to gain skills that will help them succeed when they become an adult.",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. A teacher-designed school project is a way to communicate with upcoming students through the introduction of the new curriculum. However, a student-designed project allows students to choose their own topic. The students would have complete control over their summer project, permitting them to prove what they are individually capable of. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to explore their own interests, it gives students more freedom to be creative, and is less stressful.\n \n Students should be able to design their own projects so that they can indulge themselves in matters that personally interest them. For example, students would put more effort into a project they are interested in, rather than one assigned to them. Researching topics that are unappealing does not encourage a higher quality outcome in an assignment. The freedom to explore other topics that are more personal and relatable gives students the power to prove they understand their project. Also, students have more freedom in their presentation. They are allowed to represent their knowledge through the projects in whatever form they believe fits best. This way, teachers are able to see work habits and the effort students provide in their project's display. Freedom in choosing their own topics truly allows students to learn about what they desire.\n \n Another reason in favor of student-designed projects is the capability of creativity. A personal project allows students to create their work however they see fitting. Students can design and display their summer's worth of research in their own creative ways. Students creating their own projects freely will provide better, more creative outcomes. In addition, teacher-assigned projects teach kids to follow a rubric and limit their own creativity. Students will put less effort into a project with specific guidelines because they are less interested and feel constrained to the task's specific guidelines. Developing their own projects allows them to be free-thinking, and provide a creative project that accurately represents their efforts. Student-designed projects allow for more creativity than teacher-designed projects.\n \n Finally, student projects are less stressful than a teacher-assigned project. For example, all students creating the same exact project encourages academic competition. Competing to create and develop a better project than friends and peers introduces more stress to students. A summer project should not be used to stress students, for the students will recieve unwanted and false ideas about the stress and workload of school. Also, unwanted stress can cause the students to cheat on or disregard their assignments. The pressure of a teacher-designed project could drive students to copy another students' work. Other students, who are notÂ engaged in a teacher-designed project, might completely blow off the project, and waste their summer unproductively. Stress drives students to make projects more trouble than they are worth.\n \n Student-designed summer projects are clearly a better choice than teacher-designed projects. Students are permitted to research and report on their own interests and what applies to them. Creativity in their projects is derived from the freedom to complete their work in their own way. Student-designed projects take away from the amount of stress added from teacher-assigned projects and their elaborate rubric and grading systems. A student's own project can display one's hardworking capabilities towards a set of academic goals.",

      "Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project.\n \n Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do.\n \n In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish ,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions.\n \n I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work.\n \n Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like.\n \n In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed.Â",

      "These summer projects should be student designed for sure. It shows which students who are willing to apply themselves and show how creative they are, which would separate them from the rest. This would in return create a bias with the teacher.\n \n If summer projects were designed in such a way where the student led their own idea with what to do with said topic, this would ulimtatly separate students from each other. I refer to this as \"the breaking point\". I refer to it as \"the breaking point\" because it shows which students who are willing to apply themselves, who are trying with mediocre effort or don't care at all. It builds discipline and character. If you are willing enough to take the extra mile and go out of your way to make this project the best ever, then that proves to your teacher that you are the one who wants it, you are the one to ask questions, you are the one to make it. Some students would probably set them selfÂ up for failure and try to find the easy way too workout around said project. All this shows is that they wish to take the wide path that life has set before us and not the narrow path with temptations that build that discipline. This project should be meant for who wants it, not for what its really on. It should basically be an assessmentÂ to see what level of goat they are on.\n \n Now there is a very great con to my argument. That con my friend has a name, and her name is, bias. With going with the plan on doing said project create a very huge bias within teachers. Once they see who was very willing to apply themselves and who wasn't, they'll most likely start to prematurely pick and choose favorites. I say this because they'll start to imagine how well this student will do in their class and how terrible the next would. Come school time, the kids won't know it, but the teacher already has a secret disliking for some of the students. It's to hell with them basically. It's hard for us students to overcome such a bias from a mistake we made. Even if we start acing the teachers class, they'll probably jump to conclusions and assume we have cheated all year or something. This project is a great cause with two possible outcomes: A great upbringing or a terrible downfall. But see, you might have though that I am swaying you away from actual argument but here's where the good comes in. This project brings out the teachers true character as well, we can see if the teacher is really loving as people say they are no matter what, or will their true colors show? This whole thing is one big assessment on everyone's moral values. Are you a fan or a hater?\n \n In conclusion, life is what it is. Bias or not, let the kids show who they are and who THEY want to be. Don't allow teachers to solely let the do what they want but instead let a student explore his mental. Let us breathe and thrive in life. Let us learn from our own mistake and not be carried on the shoulders of someone else. I would like to end this passage with a qoute I made myself.\n \n \"One can only achieve which he belives\"\n \n -Generic_NameÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Teachers give students summer projects to make sure that we are still learning and not forgetting information that we already know and to keep working the students brain. I agree with teachers assigning students a summer project because it lets the students be creative and learn in a fun way.\n \n I agree that summer projects should be student designed because it will show what the students have learned and it would show what they need to improve on. Students will be learning more because the students would be researching to find information and they would learn new information. Students can learn and be involved with the project and it would raise your grade if it is low. If the student is bored and has nothing to do than they can work on the project.\n \n Also, students can be creative and design the project how they want to do it. Being creative is great because it lets the student show what they got and just have fun with it. Being creative can lead to positive thinking and makes the students feel like they can do it. Students love making projects how they want to and makes them think and brainstorm to see how they will make it look like they gave it all they had. Students love being creative and the students learn while being creative on the project and to show how much potential the students have in them.\n \n Some students find the topic they get for the project interesting and joyable. If students like the topic then they will do more research and learn and have fun with the project. Student designed projects will let the students have fun and research and learn about the topic and let the students explore. Student designed projects will be better for the students and let them show you what they learned and researched about and to let them show how creative they are. Students having teacher designed doesn't let them be creative and let them research and find information and to let them show what they have learned.

      "Summer vacation is a time of rest, relaxation, and recreation for public school students across the nation. However, this break is also well-known for creating significant academic setbacks for these students and causing them to struggle in their return to school. To solve this common issue, many schools have started to require their students to complete a summer project in order to maintain their academics outside of school. Although these projects would be more educationally beneficial for the students if constructed by the teachers, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to do a high-quality project are increased.\n \n To begin with, the summer break projects should be constructed by the students because they are more likely to enjoy the project. In today's society, many students enjoy creating things that they thought of themselves and were not assigned by a teacher or parent. Consequently, if these projects were created by teachers, the students would say that the topic that the teachers selected for the project was not interesting enough and would not be as motivated to complete the assignment. If these projects were created by the students, they would not feel forced to do the project. Instead, they would leave for summer vacation already anticipating starting this fun and exciting new activity. In conclusion, schools should allow students to create their own summer project because the students are more likely to enjoy it.\n \n In addition, the allowance of a student-constructed summer project would increase the probability of completion by the students. If the students are permitted to complete a project of their own invention, their motivation to do it will increase because they are guaranteed to enjoy the topic of the project. Teacher-constructed projects are not likely to suit the interests of each of their students. This results in a percentage of the students not enjoying the topic of the project, losing motivation to do what was assigned, and eventually not completing the project at all. This can be avoided if the topic of the summer project was student-selected because each student would be doing something that they are interested in. To conclude, students should be allowed to select their own summer project instead of the teachers selecting it because their motivation to complete the project is guaranteed to increase significantly.\n \n Finally, schools should permit students to pick their own summer project because the chance that students will construct a project of higher quality will increase. Students completing a project that they are interested in are proven to spend more time and effort on their assignment. Forcing students to construct a project that they are not interested in is the easiest way to receive a low-quality project. In order to prevent students from creating an unambitious and lazily-made project, schools should permit students to choose what project they will be doing. This ensures that every student is doing something that they will be guaranteed to enjoy. To summarize, the allowance of student-constructed projects increases the probability that schools will receive high-quality projects on their return.\n \n In conclusion, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to complete a high-quality project are increased. The projects mandated by these schools will create a new generation of inquisitive and ambitious students. The students who complete these interactive and enjoyable projects are more probable to enjoy school on their return and have an increase in motivation and ambition regarding their academics. Allowing the students to construct these summer break projects instead of the teachers is the best possible decision that America's schools could ever make for the future generations of today's society.",

    essay:
      "For many students, summer projects are a useless task forced upon them by their teachers. These assignments can be detrimental to the continuity of the students' learning. Without the freedom to stray from the normal, one may become expectant of nothing more. Student led assignments give highschoolers the opportunity to be creative in their learning, learn responsibility, and prepare them for the future.\n \n During the school year, students are expected to learn through the guidance of the teacher. While some people enjoy this structure, many feel their creativity is being repressed. A survey done on high schools students, asking about how they feel they have the ability to represent themselves through schoolwork, 75% feel that they do not have the option to express themselvesÂ with their current workload. With a self-led summer project students could continue learning through the break, by studying a topic that interestsÂ them which, in turn, inspires them to create a more thought out end result.\n \n Responsibility, a skill hopefully learned by students through school, is not easy to become proficient at. And with many teachers setting deadlines and giving extensions, students can lose responsibility without trial and error. A psychological study that followed five students' grades and work style throughout four years portrayed the effect that self-led projects had on students before they left for college. Teenagers who had no control over their learning, while seemingly successful with their grades, lacked development on the section of the brain that controls creativity and responsibility. However, students who worked with their teachers on their course of study had better developed this section. These skills not only help students grow as self-thinkers, but as responsible and thoughtful human beings.\n \n In many ways, the future for today's children is unlike the life they live now in school. There will no longer be someone to give them instructions for every task, and many projects are completely controlled and monitored by the person creating it. School is designed to prepare students for the real world, yet many findÂ themselves lost by the time they must complete their own study or presentation in college. While it may be difficult to recreate these circumstances in high school, a summer project gives students 2 time to thoroughlyÂ researchÂ and involve themselves in their project. One may find themselves discovering new topics that they were not previously aware of. Whereas without the freedom to follow their own direction, they would become trapped with the same topic and format as everyone else.\n \n Free thinking is an important skill to have once you're an adult, and student-designed projects support the formation of this skill. The opportunity to express themselves through their learning is essential to the development of useful, creative habits that can be extremely helpful for the future of the world.",

      "Summer break is that time of the year where most students look forward to. Many are eager to sit back and relax, or enjoy their time with friends and family. Whatever it is, school is the last thing on their mind. It's the last thing on my mind too. Although that isn't always the case, there is always that one teacher that assigns projects over break. Summer projects are required through some schools to preserve their learning onto the next year. To make it more enjoyable, I believe that these summer projects should at least be student-designed for various reasons.\n \n Summer break is the time where most students proceed to pursue hobbies, enjoy lifes moments, spend time with people that are cared about, and make memorial memories. Over break, students tend to discover their true passions and focus on what drives their interest. With projects being assigned, that can be tough and build a wedge between the situation. If summer projects were to be student-designed however, students can make it more personalized and just have fun with it. I believe making the summer projects more personalized to students, can really ease the stress and make it more enjoyable. Overall, it is summer break. As a student myself, a time where this applied to me was in the summer of my freshman year. My teacher had assigned a summer project where we had to determine the area of different shapes in any form. Art is a huge passion of mine and I wanted to engage more of it into my summer. I decided to paint an abstract painting with a variety of shapes; circles, triangles, squares, you name it. It turned out beautiful, I really enjoyed spending my time on something that was educating and delightful. Engaging learning with enjoyable hobbies can be beneficial for the teachers' satisfactory and the students.\n \n For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. Student designed school projects can really help a student find his/her passions and learn something new along the way. An example of this is Generic_Name. When Generic_Name was younger, she stayed in a hostel and went to an all girls catholic school. Although the classes were given to her and the staff controlled her schedule, she found a way to have a passion for computers. Her summer assignment was to find am interest to occupy her for the upcoming summer. She began to observe her fathers work and grew an interest for how computers work. Today, she works in the computer coding world and enjoys every second of it. With enough interest, there is always something new just waiting to be discovered, who knows maybe you'll learn something new on the way. Student designed school projects can help one into discovering a new passion.\n \n Although students might think making school projects student-designed is a good idea, teachers might not agree. Some students could take this their advantage, by making the project as simple and pointless as they want. This could necessarily not reach the teachers standards and question if the student even learned anything at all. Although this could be case, summer projects are indeed just summer projects and shouldÂ not be taken seriously. Summer should be the time where students can have the choice of doing what they want. If projects are mandatory for teachers, then it can be arranged, but it shouldn't put unnecessary stress on students. Especially during summer break. Teachers should observe how well the student comes up with ideas and how well they execute their projects, it's more exciting that way.\n \n Having being said, student designed projects are better for both the student and the teacher. It allows students to have more freedom and personalize their studies with their occupation. Teachers will also have the chance to determine the students personality and see what the student is like. It shows how bright a student's mind can be and how well their work ethics are. Teachers should give students a chance to show off themselves and appreciate for what they are able to achieve in. It can also be a fun learning experience for many. Not only will these student-designed projects continue their learning throughout break, it will also preserve any sort of creativity a student could withhold.Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Summer break, a time for both students and teachers to get a few months away from the not so wonderful place we call school. While most schools allow students a complete break from doing work there are some who still want to continue the learning experience during those months off. These schools require students to do a summer project to ensure they continue learning and don't completely shut off their brains. The question retaining to this topic is, should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? My stance on this is, the projects should be student-designed being that this is their break from school and they are still being required to complete a project.\n \n Students need the freedom to choose what they want the project to be about. Even during the school year most projects are teacher-designed, the teacher always has things set up how they want it and all the projects end up looking the same. I personally don't know how many students would complete a full project over the summer anyway, but if they are allowed to design it and set it up themselves I think they will be more excited to complete the task. Students also deserve this freedom, I feel like so many times teachers restrict things or make things more complicated by giving the students no freedom. Also, by allowing students the freedom to design their projects many students will show more respect for their teachers in the future and be more likely to work harder on other other things they are required to do.\n \n Whether students choose to show it in the work they turn in to their teachers, they are all so highly creative. I feel that most students don't tend to show how creative they are because they don't like the assignment they are given or feel like the guidelines are too strict to fully express themselves. I think it's important for teachers to know what their students are capable of and see that they can really bring their best work forward when they allow students to have more control of a project. Creativity is a really great way to understand someone, if teachers allow the students to be creative then they will start putting more of themselves into the projects and teachers can really start to see what wonderful minds they all have. Students need to be able to express themselves in creative ways and one of those ways is by allowing them to design their own project.\n \n My final point I'm going to make is that even though some schools may want to continue the learning experience during the summer it is still the students summer break. The thing most students look forward to from day one of school is summer break and a good majority of those students definitely don't want to have to complete a school related project when they are away from school. But if it's a requirement then allow the the students to choose what their projects will be about. Most teachers don't do work over the summer cause that's their break as well so if students must be forced to complete a task then let them be in charge so they aren't completely miserable their whole summer.\n \n In conclusion, the required summer project that students have to complete should be student-designed. These students work hard for almost ten months and deserve a break without hard, restricted work their teachers assign. But, if it is a requirement they deserve to be in charge of it. They need to be allowed the freedom to create these projects as they see fit. Students are wonderful, creative people and need to be allowed to express themselves thoroughly so that teachers can see what theyÂ are capable of when they let them take the reigns and let their creative magic happen. After all summer break is supposed to be a time for them to relax and forget about school for awhile and they most certainly don't want a complicated project to work on so, I say, the students need to be able to design their own projects for sake of letting them enjoy their summer break.",

      'Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did notÂ know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being 3, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being 3 during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, "I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scaredÂ to complete the test before the timer goes off becauseÂ I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be 3 on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakesÂ in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said "I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even thoughÂ you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving.\n \n Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focusedÂ and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the yearÂ I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projectsÂ teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy becauseÂ most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible.\n \n Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being 3, hardworking andÂ responsible for their work during the break.Â',

      "Generic_Name is given a summer project by her teacher and is annoyed over having to do work over the summer, but once she actually starts the project she realizes it helps her remember material and comes to school feeling more prepared. A teacher gives students a project to do over the summer knowing exactly what the students need in order to continue learning and become prepared for the coming school year. Although receiving work to do over the summer for students may be bothersome, teachers understand the requirements students should meet in order to learn efficiently throughout the summer so that they will not forget important material. Teachers should be designing the summer projects rather than students themselves because they understand what material is needed to learn, they have a broader outlook on what all students can do, and they will provide a more challenging project.\n \n Although a student may argue that students should be the ones designing the summer projects because as a student, students will know what will be good for other students. Being the same age group may help in developing a project that will help other students learn over the summer but consequently that is not the case. Students are all different when it comes to learning techniques and when coming up with a project, it may either be difficult or too easy for other classmates. Work provided by students will vary in results and become unreliable. Teachers know what is needed to learn and therefore give students a summer projects that will be efficient enough to help students during the summer.\n \n In order to be prepared for the coming school year, students will need know what material is necessary to remember. Teachers know exactly what material be taught and need to make sure students do not forget basic information. When coming up with a project for students a English teacher will know which basic information is needed to remember, such as knowing basic vocabulary terms to distinguish while reading, Students will easily forget terms and struggle when coming back to school and needing to restudy these basic terms, it also takes away more time for teachers to teach. Teachers are the ones teaching the material and understand the necessitiesÂ students are gonna need to remember for the upcoming year.\n \n With that, to make sure students actually do learn, it is necessary that students are given a project that will be helpful for the majority. Teachers have the broader outlook on what exactly the majority of students should be learning and will help students learn over the summer that way they will feel more prepared for the coming school year. Teachers will ensure that by looking through test averages, seeing where students did worst and best at and reflect that on the summer project. By looking through what students did best and worst at teacher will provide a helpful project for the summer to make sure students learn in the summer. Students will have the lower hand in this situation because of lack of knowledge towards what other classmates did well and bad on.\n \n Summer projects will only help students learn if the project actually requires students to think and work efficiently. Teachers will be sure students are given a project they cannot just wing and do quickly. Teachers could give essays or book reports that way students will actually be more hands on and not lack off doing the summer projects. Giving students a more challenging or thinking based summer project will not only prevent laziness but will make the students feel more productive with their summer. The boost of productivity will give more confidence to the students as in something that could be too easy to quickly finish. Teachers understand that more thinking based work or more work will help students learn more efficiently and be more productive. Giving them a simple project or a project that involves little work will only increase the chances of students lacking off and therefore result in nothing being learned.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects are given to students so that they continue to learn in the summer and become more prepared for the coming school year. Whether or not these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, it is easier to say they should be teacher-designed. Teachers understand the material and the students and therefore will provide a more efficient summer project. When being able to understand what is required for a summer project, teachers will have the better understanding on ensuring the project will be efficient for students to learn.Â",

      "How would a student feel if they had to endure a lesson during the summer by a immature kid? Summer assignments have been implicated in student's daily lives since 7th grade. The theory is that if teachers provide students with a summer assignment, they will be ready for the classroom in the fall. However, there is a rise in the education department where they have to see if it is really benifical for the younger generation to have their assignments designed by a teacher or a student. The pratical answer for this discussion would be to have a teacher-designed summer assignment because it will prepare the students for their class, strengthn their abilities, and open their eyes to what the future would look like going into higher education.\n \n Learning the material by someone who is already trained in this profession will help prepare the students for the year since the teacher is the one who is going to help them get a wide range of education. It will be more benifical if the students learn this way because its going to get them ready for the year. For example, if a math teacher gives a student a summer project that they designed they will already have a planned idea of what is going to be in the next school year. This will let the young adults see what they will be doing in the following school year which in turn can help the student understand if this class is the right clas for them.\n \n Not to mention, if the summer assignments were teacher-designed it will give the students the oppurtunity to learn more about their strengths and weaknesses. In the school system more than 85% of the school's population have struggled in one or two subjects. Moreover, that means students will have a harder time grasping certain subjects when the school year begins. If the assignments where created by the teacher then they will have an easier time at the beginning of the year to understand what the student is struggling with. Moreover, it could also help the student by getting the student to think more about what they struggle with and how they can grow upon it since it is an independent project.\n \n However, since it is a summer assignment, students would not be as motivated to do the work since it is an extended amount of time ot do a minimal activity. As teens go into summer they do not worry about the summer assignment and get this feeling of procrastination with the certain activity. 95% of teens around the world struggle with this thought and wait until the last minute. Which could be damaging to the students education.\n \n Since procrastionation occurs it would be more likely for students to cheat. However, making the assignment teacher designed and giving it time stamps of when it is due during the summer will force students to deal with time managment. Moreover, if we allow our children to be interactive with teacher-designed assignments, then they will be more prepared for the future. For example, if an english teacher decides to make a summer assignment and put certain due dates during the summer rather then giving them a student-designed activity; It will give the student a chance to learn about what it means to have responsibilities. Which is important because it will make sure that students can be independent with their jobs.\n \n The debate on whether or not summer assignments should be designed by a certain person has shown the community what really is important in this society. Our educators wanna make sure that the students will be prepared for what is coming to them, especially if they are taking an AP course. Moreover, it will shine light to some of the weaknesses in a student early on so the educator can help them with this skill. Likewise, it can also make the young adults open to ideas of having important responsiblities so they will be ready for the workforce. No matter what occurs in life, educators should make sure that they are guiding the new generation to a bright and happy future.Â",

    essay:
      "Summer projects have become a cultural norm within the school system. These projects have been created and mandated by the teachers. It can be vigorous and also very flexible depending on the teachers idea of what they believe you should do. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kidsÂ to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom.Â Generic_Name, a student at Generic_School, completes vigorous sports and extra curricular activities during summer and, also has 5 different classes with summer assignments. Generic_Name has designed a workload that he can complete while leaving free time but, his teachers have designed summer projects that completely wipe out all his free time. Generic_Name should be able to design a summer project that works for his schedule and, should not be told by his teachers what to do on his only long term break from those teachers. Another student, named Generic_Name, wishes to be engaged during her time off but does not want the burden of having her summer break destroyed by teachers who try to maximize their workload during the time off. She wants to be able to create a project that minimizes her time learning but that keeps her engaged during the break so that she is ready to come back. By mandating what students do outside of school limits their freedom during a time where they should be on a break from school; This totally destroys the whole idea of summer being a break and a time to de-stress by constantly stressing students to finish summer projects. Students want freedom during the summer, this is why projects should be student designed.\n \n Also, summer projects should be student designed because it keeps the students interested in their project. A 12th grade student, named Generic_Name, is being told by his teacher that he must read the book, the odyssey, during his summer break but, Generic_Name has no interest in that book what so ever. Students should have the ability to chose which book they read, if any. If a teacher tells a student they must read a novel over summer, they can choose a book that interests them so it makes it easier and, ultimately more fun for the student. A 9th grader, named Generic_Name is required to complete an 100 question math summer packet during her time off. She has AD/HD and struggles to stay focused for long periods of time, especially in things that do not interest her. By allowing her to complete online practice using a math app, it will keep her engaged and will allow her to make sure she is doing these problems correctly. Teachers mandating what students do and how they do it may interest the teacher but, a majority of the time, will bore the student and can actually lead to a regression in their skills. If students can design their own summer project that keeps them interested, it ultimately leads to more participation and 3ness among students.\n \n Furthermore, Summer projects should be student designed because it allows for more flexibility within their project. For example, Generic_Name, a student athlete, plays on one of the highest rankedÂ women'sÂ lacrosse teams in the country, she has practice and workouts during the weekdays and aÂ tournamentÂ every single weekend.Â Generic_Name was assigned a 400 page book to read but can never find the time nor the energy to read that much. By allowing her to chose, for example, an 150 page book, she can find enough time and energy to stay focused, and be able to complete the book. If students are not allowed the ability to design their projects it tends to become more of a pain to the student, rather than help. It tends to stress students more, especially those with vigorous schedules, during a time created for students to take a break. An 11th grade Spanish teacher, Generic_Name, sends out a summer assignment that requires students to go out and use Spanish in the real world. What would be considered to most students as an easy task, some students are not comfortable with this and would rather do book workÂ at home where they feel more comfortable. A one size fits all plan does not work for every student, some need hands on learning, some need to listen to instruction and be taught directly to, and some students need to read and do book work. The idea that one assignment will fit every students needs and allow them to complete it quickly and efficiently will quite frankly never work. This type of flexibility is what students need out of summer projects and, they should be designed by the students.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kidsÂ to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project. Every student is a different learner with different advantages and disadvantages and, projects should be made to meet those students needs or they will either not complete it, or complete it while gaining nothing from it. Students know what they need and should not be completely controlled by teachers who think they know whats best for them. The student knows themselves better than anyone else in the world so they should be able to design their own summer projects.Â  Â",

      "Teachers are ready to go to action to help their students succeed and learn.\n \n Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break, and coming back to school knowing whats coming. The summer projects should be designed by the teachers because teachers have it planned, teachers know the information needed on the project , and it gives the students a less work lode over their break.\n \n First thing is, teachers would have the projects all planned out for their students, so the student won't have to worry to plan a project out. It gives a teacher a relief knowing that their student has a project ready for them, and not having to worry that the student for the them to make one. It is also important for the teacher to have it planned because they would have all the work needed on the project.\n \n When the teachers plans it out it would be more organized. It is also better for the teacher to have it planned; because they can see where the students need help when they have completed the project.\n \n Teachers would know what information is needed to help the student learn ,and get them ready for the upcoming year. When the teacher has all the work needed on the project; the student wont have to worry and look upÂ what they need to study. This is important because it gives the teachers the information to see what their students are struggling in ,and plan ahead for the year. When the information is laid out for the student it would be more: organized to do their work, more efficient, and gives them a heads up to see what their struggling in. This will also be easier on the teacher when they have the project ready for the students because it gives them an idea how to gradeÂ the project.\n \n The summer projects would be best if the teachers design them. Thats because when students are on break; they would get to lazy and not even want to start making a project for school. Also the student might even forget to design it on their own. Thats why when the teacher has it already designed; they can email their students, and remind them to work on the project that is already made for them. Another reason why the teacher should design the projects is, it gives the students time to be kids and have fun. Also it gives the students more time to enjoy their break with their family and friends. Over all it would give the student lees of a work lode over the break and let them be kids and enjoy.\n \n Although students should be able to design their own projects because they can study and do the parts they need to learn more; other then having to do work that they already know, but teachers insures that all the students have the needed work and information that the students need to learn. Also the teachers would have all the information if the student forgets to include in their project. Over all it would be the best for the teachers and students if the teacher designed the project becuse:\n \n it would be planned out, teachers know the information needed on the project , and it gives the students a less work lode over their break.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Many students tend to forget or struggle when their teachers assign them with projects over the summer.Â Students should design their own projects because teachers don't know what students do over the summer and students want to have fun and want to enjoy it more than having to still do school work. This lets students create a project that will allow them to manage how much time they can set into doing school work and have more time enjoying their break. Letting students choose helps them by setting it at a level that they can work at without struggle and make it easier for them.\n \n Students creating a student-designed project will allow them to manage time better with what they can work on during the summer and have more time enjoying their break. Most students like to travel over the break and sometimes they can't do it abroad and don't have much time when they come back. For example: \"I went to El Salvador with my father and he lives in the country side, in his house he doesn't have wifi but does have cable. Coming back I only had five days to do it before I had to go back to middle school.\" Students wouldn't be able to do any school work because they could probably not have internet access and want to enjoy their time visiting.\n \n Students can design their project and making it easier by doing: a summary over a couple of simple novels, do a short essay over a easy and simple prompt, do research over patterns in nature like, looking at moon patterns for two weeks or observe temperatures for a period amount of time and do a study on it when they come back. For example: \" I had a simple project to recorded what the moon looked like at night, every night for a week and draw it. This was easy and simple for me to do and i still learned a lot from it from observing that the moon slowly phases through each night through its cycle.\" Even doing small simple projects, students can still learn and discover new things because they don't have to stress about it and its something most students should be able to do.\n \n Someone might say, Teachers select projects that they think is good for students and it's better for a teacher to have control over it because they know their students best, expects them to do their best, accomplish it and that challenging them is good so they don't forget what they learned; however, that's not the case, really what teachers don't know sometimes, and what makes students have a hard time or take a long time on projects is that, teachers want to assign projects to what they think their students can do and put them at a challenging level or a process that takes a long time but students want to have it simple over the summer has they don't have class with other students and don't meet their teachers anymore so they can't ask for help. Students don't need to stress out over the summer by what their teachers assign, letting students decide lets them be creative and discover with what they chose to do.\n \n In conclusion, Student-designed projects, will encourage and help students with work and still learn from it as the teacher wanted for them to learn in the students own creative way.",

      "Is not three months of summer break a very long time to stay away from school work? The summer break is very discussed by people because for some, it is a very long period were people can relax and take a break from the school season.

Altrought complete summer projects designed by the teachers for a school purpose during the summer break could dissappoint a lot of students, the teachers know which topic the students have to focus on, and be ready to go back in school as better as possible, for the next school year.\n \n Having a big vision of the development that the student did during the year, the teachers are the best individuals to assign project to work on and refresh on what has been done.\n \n In this case, student have a complete plan to work on and view where they have problems or concerns and be able to get feedback from the teachers. They do not have to spend time in researching in which topics they want to focus, havind a designed plan that cover most of them.

I feel as it should be teacher designed because some people wouldn't know what to come with, It would make it easier because they are more familiar to teacher designed assignments, and most students wouldnt do it because its not teacher designed.\n \n First, most students would feel as it's easier because it's teacher designed and thats what they are familiar to. For example, The teacher gave us students designed projects and we really didn't know what to do. So when the time came for us to turn it in, the class really didn't get a good grade.\n \n Another reason, is some people wouldn't know what to come with.

So they went to each others houses and would think about what they should do and before they knew it, it was time for the project to be turned in.

      "Some schools require summer projects for students; these projects need to be student designed. When teachers plan a project some students don't enjoy completing the assigned task. For students to learn they have to be interested in what they are doing. There are many ways to assign a school project, it could be hands on, writing, individually, in groups etc. Each student has different skills, they should do a project that best fits that skill to succeed. Summer projects need to be student designed so that they are more motivated to complete the assignment, to have fun with the assignment and to have interest in the task.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to enhance motivation. When students are motivated this encodes the topic in their memory. When students are motivated they get better grades, the project is better quality and students do the project to their best ability. As a student when a project gets assigned and I am not interested in the assignment I try to get it done as quickly as possible and put no effort into it. I end up getting a lower grade. Students will also want to keep working on the project if they are motivated to complete it. With more time spent on the project this equals better quality and higher grades. Students won't procrastinate if the project interests them and will be motivated to start the project early. As a student in High School lots of students procrastinate when given a project. If projects were student designed this would motivate them to learn about the topic.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed so that they have fun with it. If they had fun with the assignment then they would have a memory of their experience. If schools made learning fun they are more likely to remember the topic of the project. If students were in a group for the project this would enhance team work skills if they had fun. As a student I found out that if I had fun learning about a certain topic I remember it more clearly and can connect it to other things in life.\n \n Summer projects need to be student designed to have students have interest in the topic. This would help students explore their interests that they never knew they were interested in. This may help students what they want to do after graduation. Chances are if a student is really interested in what they learned in class then they might explore that topic outside of school. When I had a project assigned to me that I was interested in I enjoyed completing the project and continued to learn more about it outside of school. Summer projects that have students interested is a key to success in their academic career.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects need to be student designed so that they look forward to working on the assignment, enjoy completing the task and continue learning about the topic outside of school. Some people say that projects should be teacher designed they are wrong because students then dont get the freedom of doing what they enjoy most. It also isn't equal to all students. For example, a teacher assigns a research paper on a certain topic, some students have a love for writing and it is their strength and others don't like to write. This is why student designed projects are important.Â",

      "Summer projects are notorious for being not only extremelyÂ uninteresting, but incredibly easy to put off. While teachers have tried to find ways of captivating students by giving a varietyÂ of choices or making it more hands on, they always miss the real reason why students seems to loathe these assignments. I believe that it all comes down to student choice. Society teaches us that we are all different in our own ways and that people want to do different things, but this is not demonstratedÂ in our schools. A step forward into integrating more individual-focused work is by starting off with one of the most hated assignments for all children, summer projects. Having student-designed projects would give students the chance to explore topics they're interested in, control over how they want they're project to turn out, and incentives creative thinking.\n \n The most common response I get from my peers when we get a project over the summer is, \"Why would I need to know about this?\". This leads to them not caring about the outcome of their assignment and putting minimal effort into it, thus leading to lackluster scores. This could be absolved by letting them choose what they want to learn more about. Seeing that it is the summertime, I believe that students shouldn't be tied down to one subject, but use their break to learn whatever they feel that they need to put more time into. Even if it has to revolve around one subject, they should have the option to include aspects of other subjects that they would find more enjoyable. Giving them the option to choose where they want their time to be spent would open up different avenues for them to take their learning.\n \n Students want more control over how they want their work to turn out. Giving strict restraints on how the project should be about and its formattingÂ disincentives students who work at a slower pace and holds back those who work faster. Rather than molding the student to fit into the curriculum, make the curriculum easier to mold. Give students the best opportunity to grow and succeed rather than holding them to a set standard that all can't meet. We all have different preferences and learning levels and our work should reflect those differences.\n \n Letting them design their own projects would challenge them to think creatively. With the option to take aspects of multiple subjects and to illustrate it in a precise manner, you would have to think of creative ways to present it. This would force students to think carefully about what information they want to include and the undertones that it could have, just like in real world presentations.Â With the choices that would be given to them, students would have to find the right combinationÂ of formats and subjects that would most accuratelyÂ reflects their goal.\n \n While some would say that it could lead to students choosing the easiest route, I believe this comes from a place of little faith. Given the chance to learn more about something that actually interests them, I think that most students would jump on the chance. The reason why students, especially high school students, seem so apathetic is that we aren't interested. We feel as if we're just going through the motions of school and that summer projects are just a way to bleed more of our time away. The problem isn't the student, but how the system is set in place.\n \n Summer projects have always been a chore to do. From the uninteresting topics, to the fact that it's during the summer has always made students dread, but if these projects were designed by the students, I think we would see a sharp spike in enthusiasm around their arrival. Being able to choose the topic, have control over how it turns out, and the need to actually think creatively would excite students and teachers alike. Giving us the chance to express ourselves would be the right direction for summer projects.",

Students they chose their own topic and design their own project willÂ be more interested in what they are learning. Also the students would be more likely to actually do the project if it is something they have interest in, and the students would have more say in what they are learning if they got to design their own summer project.\n \n If students were allowed to design their own project they would be a lotÂ more likely to actually do the project. Most students rather be with friends or on vacation during summer, rather then staying inside and working on a paper for school in two months. If the student designed the project it would be something that they might actually want to do or find interesting, not just something they were told they had to do the last day of school for that year. I know when I'm on vacation I like to do what I want to do and not be followed around by all the school I have to get done. So if it feels less like school work and more like a project that you want to do in your free time the students might actually do it.\n \n Letting the student have a say in the design of their project helps them get more involved with their learning and education. If you just et a teacher tell them what to do they will get bored with learning and not be interested and learning new things, but if they got a say in them project they could get involved and actually enjoy learning.

A teacher can just pick a random topic without even thinking if the students will find it interesting.

When you are forced to learn about something that doesn'tÂ interest you it is harder to learn that topic. You have to do it all the time in schools such SOL's. You learn about something in school that does not interest you so the state will give you a label of smart or not smart even if you are just not interested in the random topics they pick to say they have taught you something. If it is a project that is to be done over summer vacation, let it be something that the student might actually enjoy and want to do. The student can easily just blow of the project and then start the next year in a bad spot because he or she is already behind on the first day of school and that is setting them up for failure for the rest of the year.\n \n Although teachers liking to design their summer projects for the students, the students should design their summer project. Have the project follows certain guide lines so it is still some what attached to what the students learned in school. Having the students get involved with their education is good for a lot more than just school, it can help them in the real world too.

      "Over the summer, the majority of students will forget the core lessons they learned; therefore, some teachers decide to give students summer projects to keep information fresh in their minds. There is an ongoing debate over whether teachers should choose the summer projects for students, or if the assignment should be the ideas of the student themselves. There are those that say that it would be better for teachers to assign their own project, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.\n \n There are a variety of reason why students should create their own summer project. First and foremost, it inspires creativity. When a teacher assigns their own cut-and-paste project, this removes most creativity from the assignment. Students need to practice creative skills, and the low stress environment of summer is a perfect time for doing that. Additionally, students having their own project idea allows them to do what they want to do. This is obviously beneficial because the student can choose the subject that they are best at, which will improve the quality of the summer project. Also, giving the student the choice on what they want to do makes the project enjoyable, which is important considering that it is summer break. Finally, allowing students to assign their own project ideas motivates the student to actually do it. It is very common to witness teachers giving direct instructions on how the class should do something in a certain way, only for the students to lose interest. On the other hand, giving students their own unique project can inspire them to complete it with actual effort.\n \n There are additional reason why students should create their own summer projects. For instance, the student can use real world examples that they are familiar and can easily understand. Most teachers, especially ones in larger schools, will not know the student's personal interests and experience very well. Students can take inspiration, data, and ideas from their surroundings during the summer, which can make for an excellent project. Another reason students should design their own summer projects is that it creates less stress for the teacher. If students are making their own projects, it will make the job of teachers easier since they dont have to create unique prompts for each student. Additionally, each student having their own personally crafted project will get rid of the possibility of cheating, something they have would have if students were all to have the same assignment. Lastly, students creating their own summer projects will prepare them for the future. In college, many assignments given by your professor will be self directed, meaning you will need practice in creating your own ideas for projects. Careers also rely on creativity, innovations need to be made for more efficient work, which can earn you promotions.\n \n Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects. This is the case due to less overall stress, motivation for students, and inspiration for creativity and innovation. There are those that say teachers should design the project for the student because the teacher knows what the student needs to learn, what the school board wants, and what the student will learn the following year, but this is not the case. It's true teachers need to encourage creativity in and outside the classroom, but students also should enjoy their summer break after a hard school year.Â",

      "Summer assignments are important to help students continue learning over the summer. This is why these assignments should be designed by teachers, rather than students. This is due to the fact that teachers are going to assign challenging projects, which most students would not; additionally, teachers may use this assignment as a way to prepare the students for the following year.\n \n Everyone wants to enjoy their summer break, go on vacations, and chill at the beach. Summer assignments are a great way to put a pause on the fun. Knowing this, students are not going to purposefully give themselves a challenging project that could benefit them in the long run. They would create assignments requiring the least amount of effort and time in order to get back to playing videogames or tanning on the beach. This defeats the purpose of the summer assignment because an easy project that does not challenge you will not continue your learning throughout the summer.\n \n Additionally, this may be a great opportunity for teachers to help prepare students for the type of assignments they will be recieving the following school year. Students are unaware of what to expect, so they cannot prepare themselves 2ly. Teachers have also been with these same students all year and know what they are good at, and what they need to work on. Assigning them a summer project may help these students work on their weak points, and gives them plenty of time to improve before the next school year.\n \n Some may argue that if students are not actively trying to challenge themselves, then they are only hurting themselves. However, many students likely are not sure what type of project would benefit them best, or are unaware of what they need to work on to improve. They also likely assume that they do not need to be challenged or believe that they are already prepared for the next school year.\n \n Overall, students would benefit more from teacher-designed summer assignments. Teachers know what students need to be prepared for and where their weak spots are. Often times students are unaware of how to help themselves improve. This last assignment can lead students in the right direction and assure that they are fully prepared for the following school year.",

      "The school system says we as students should all do some type of school related work during the summer in order to still have the knowledge of the things we learned during the time we was in school. including school projects, I do beleive that the school assignments that are givien should be student designed because in fact they are giving the work to us. The teachers already gives us alot of assgiments that are dessigned by teachers and their department maybe for once its time to give us a chance to let the projects be on us and up to our knowledge , even though the summer is really suppose to be about our summer vacation because we did just come from school and finished our requirements, the summer is really just a break for student to relax and getting your mind off school but I do agree that we should still do work and try to at least read once in a while so we dont go back to school during end of August or Septmeber and we clueless, reasons of why the summer projects should be student designed is because students may have ideas that teacher dont think about giving and belelive it or not these students can be very creative sometimes and come up with really excting ideas for projects with that being said they should be school educational wise , with the purpose of the summer projects being designed by students it's a better way of showing the teachers and the school education department that we have been learning in school what we need to know for an example when a student is doing their assignment and they include , context clue , details , strong vocabulary words and the unit basis of what we have learned in school. Coming to the next grade level it will show teachers that so far we have learned the right curriculum and the reached the standards because it will be presented in that presentation or that project assignment by the students who are doing it on their summer vacation however , if it were to be teacher designed because teachers are looking for specific portions of what they have learned during out the school year and on books they have read then I would understand why it would be that way even thought its taking out the purpose of a students own ability to do work on what they want to work on like me being in that position I would absolute take student designing the summmer projects for an answer.\n \n I would brianstorm with all my ideas for example ; the way i used math this summer when i went out and helped my father at his job because his back was injured i can definetly write out how i used some math learining skills and I can also write out the trips i went to and wrote essays about how it went and the stops we made thats a skill of writing and perhaps even reading , the more vacations and trips the longer my essays can be , of course it has to be educational wise so i will add some puncuations and maybe even the vocabulary that i learned during english class , it will show that not only do i remember what i was doing in school but I will also be preparing myself for next year I will have more practice and knowledge and try to fit in a litte bit of history in there as well like what's going on with my family and the government and how my grandma is sick so we trying to bring her here to stay with us for a while but because of the new rules in the United States , there's just some things we aren't allowed to accomplish no matter how bad we want her here and take care of her , I can definently make a project in how the government has these new rules that affects others and their familes like mine , that would be a example of me being in the postion as to it being student designed so I can personally write about how my life is going with that being said I would have to make the projects relate to school and the things we learned and of course that can be easy because there's alot of things we learn in school that can help us out later in life and when we look at a situation we see the things we been taught to prepare us in becoming adults I still til this day come home telling my parents something new that I've learned and at least try to help like when my mother lost her job and I was sitting in econ and finance and listening to my teacher tell us the things we can come off of when your in a situation like my mother when she was fired and was on a contract but because the business was low my mom was took out , teachers teach you alot about life and how you want to be ready and some students take it as a joke and others think into it and see a lot of sitiations like it when they come home and their parents having their own problems those are things we learn in school and when we have a chance to decide on our ideas. I think it's best as coming up with good thoughts on how around the places you travel or even in your own household there is school knowledge.\n \n things we learn in school students can relate to and may or may not affect them at home . When we're out of school we go home and have a long summer break and as we start to think of the things we've been taught in school we living in it and that's our future , that being said I do think students should be giving the opportuinty to decide on what they want to present there project on in the condtions of it being school educational purposes and to show how they not forgetting what students learning in school. A project in the summer especially when it's our free time, our vacation, it's time to let us students show the teachers what we know and learned from them and how we can relate to it when we are actually living in it, when we learn in school we have all this knowlege and the standards in each subject we're being taught gettting us ready when we become adults ourself. letting it be teacher-designed will only cover what a teacher expects from us. Us as students have way more to show what we know and what we keep in with us as we are being taught different lessons in each subject.",

    essay:
      "Many teachers assign summer projects to students to ensure that the child is still school focused throughout all the fun summer activities. Even though, majority of students hate the words \"summer and project\" together, giving them lead way to design their project is the best way to go. Students would have a chance to gain responsibility, be creative and make an easy grade.\n \n Firstly, giving students the lead way to design their project allows the individual to gain responsibility. The student would be obligated to make time for all the steps leading up to the final project, making them move their schedule around or cancel plans. This ties into being an adult, making sacrifices to get important things done. For example, a students gets a summer project, its a Friday night and his or her friends wants them to go out. Instead of being behind on the project from going out, simply saying no and staying in to miss out on the fun is a sacrifice to the student. Therefore, creating responsibility from the ultimatum.\n \n Secondly, letting students take lead way is the best option because it allows the student to actually be creative. Students get boring topics and assignments all the time, causing them to do poorly strictly because they dont find interest on the topic. However, giving students the free will design the project based on their interests while also being school related will definitely give a change in the result of the final project versus a random teacher designed project. For example, a teacher gives a random topic she designed to the student. The student gets a topic about plants, which the student knows nothing about while also having little to none interest about them. As a result, the student is not going to give their full potential on the project because they did not have interest on the forced topic.\n \n Lastly, letting students design their summer project will give students the ability to bring their grade up. By students being creative and going the extra mile to have a successful project will give them the the perfect opportunity to make a great grade. For example, while doing the summer project the students will have confidence in the topic. While doing research the student will know exactly what they want to look for and even have a small plan on how they'd like the final outcome of the project to be. Resulting in a confident, well putÂ together project.\n \n However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be. However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer.\n \n In result, when summer rolls around and summer projects are assigned, letting students get the opportunity to design their project gives them responsibility by making simple or grand decisions, an open door to the students creative limits, and also makes great pay off from all the hard work and dedication gone into the project. So next time a teacher assigns a boring topic, students should take the lead and make a astonishing grade.",

      "Most schools require students to complete a summer project to make sure that students are still expanding their knowledge while school is closed. These summer projects are long, uninteresting, and tiring. Most students refuse to complete a summer project. Summer projects should be made into something that students would want to do and enjoy doing. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be creative, students can pick an assignment that is best for their knowledge capability, and students become more intrigued with their assignment.\n \n Typically when summer projects are assigned from a teacher, they're similar assignments. When summer projects are similar, they attend to make all students the same and strips away any originality. Students need to be able to show their individuality through their work. Research shows that when students choose their assignments, they exceedÂ by forty-five percent more than a teacher-assigned assignment. Creativeness is something that should be essential to students because that it was forms them as a whole and makes them unique to themselves. Each summer project would allow students to express themselves in ways that a teacher-assigned summer project can't. Creativity is something that is with-in a person and something that should never be taken away from an individual.\n \n Students come in variety, from ethnicity, gender, age, and most importantly in this case, teaching perforations. Students will learn a lot better if they were allowed to pick their own assignments because they could create a summer project that is perfect for their learning pace. For example, I observed that when I am completing an assignment that is not too fast or not too slow for me, I do better tremendously. Summer projects are so horrific already, at the very least students should be able to decide what is best for their learning capacity. Pacing would set students up for great improvement and succession.\n \n Students will become more interested in their summer project. Most students will not complete or do well on something that they are not interested in. An article stated that, because students are so young, and their brain has not developed yet, their attention span is very short. Meaning that students will not focus on anything for a very long time, especially something that is boring and has no significance to them. Evidence also shows that each year the passing rate and or completion rate of summer projects never exceed or increase, the rates always decrease. Students will be intrigued with their work if its assigned by them. If teachers keep assigning summer projects then the passing rate of the summer projects will continue to decrease, students need to stay interested and the most important way to have that happen is to allow them to choose their own summer project assignment.\n \n Summer projects need to cater to students to cause improvement. Students do not require much to be successful,teachers just have to have the ability to allow their students to be flexible with their work. It is important that teachers grasp knowledge of how important it is that a student remains creative,that a student can pace themselves,that students remain intrigued, and most importantly students become successful with their summer projects. Summer projects are a wonderful idea but being student-assigned is way better.",

      "When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project.\n \n A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself.\n \n When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing.\n \n School can stress a lot of children out. Making them continue doing work can add on to their stress if it is something they feel incapable of doing. Giving students the choice of designing their project can give them the benefit of the doubt, because the project is still what the school wants but just at the rate of what the student can do. Stress should not be something a school wants their students to have.\n \n Summer break is the time for students to enjoy themselves. Students should at leastÂ have the choice on how their project is designed. All year the teachers had a say on what their work would consist of. The students should have a project they could enjoy doing, and not feel forced to do a project they would have a hard time on. If they have to have a project it should be something they do not stress over, but something they are confident in doing. Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â  Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "Have you ever wondered, why students stress themselves up during their summer vacations? Why sometimes they refuse to interact with people around them? Well, the reason of this issue is the \"teacher-designed projects.\" Projects are extremely beneficial and they can be in different forms like posters, presentations, models, videos, etc. Projects are very profitable, especially, in the long summer vacations because these introduces new ideas to students. Researching and building a project should both be interesting to students because then students will place their full effort, due to their enthusiasm. However, some schools require students to complete the teacher-designed projects. This means that students have to complete the teacher's-designed projects. What if the project is about the topic which students do not like to study about? Their lack of interest could lead them towards learning nothing about the specific topic. I believe, that schools must require students to complete summer projects of their own preference to assure they continue learning because it can help students in becoming more knowledgeable about the topic and can assist them in achieving their goals.\n \n The primary reason that why students should be allowed to have their own-designed projects is that it helps them to become more knowledgeable about the particular topic. One example of the benefits of student-designed projects is that the topic which interests them more, they are willing to put their 100% effort in researching and understanding about the topic. For instance, a student have interests in researching about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays from the sun on people. The student who enjoys this topic would not only research about the bad effects of these rays on people, but also would be automatically encouraged to go more dense to its roots, such as, effects on aquatic wildlife, atmosphere, etc. Another example of the benefits of student-designed projects is that the students can teach others about what they have learned through their research. Not everyone is aware about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays. So, the student who is already acquainted with this topic can detail the adverse impacts of these rays to his/her youngsters and even elders. Then the society of ours will also be in less danger because if everyone is aware about the adverse effects of these rays, people will be more cautious and apply precautions to stay healthy. Based on this evidence, schools should require students to complete their own-designed project, as it helps them in becoming more knowledgeable.\n \n Another reason of why schools should require students to complete summer projects of their own choice is that it is helpful in achieving their goals through the research about their interests. All the research that the project requires to have, might convey students to think and choose their particular career path. Teenagers often over thinkÂ about their future jobs and overwhelm themselves. They might consider going into the field about which they are unaware of. This makes them change their minds swiftly, from one career to another. The shifting of minds affects students when they graduate from their schools, and are unclear about their careers. But, the students which have already researched about the jobs for their careers and have made projects on their interests, they become more successful in their lives. This is because, research made them more aware about the positives and negatives of the specific careers. Another example of the benefit of the student-designed project is that the students who already researched their fields for their careers, will have the potential to make their wishes come true. Successful career paths always provide the good amount of salary. Students can use their this capital to buy houses, cars, etc. Based on these proofs, the students through their own designed projects, can choose a career path that suits them well and can fulfill their dreams.\n \n While the above specific examples shows that the schools should require the students to design their own preferred summer projects, one can argue otherwise. Some people might argue that the teachers are more knowledgeable about what the students should be learning about. That without the teacher's directions, the students will get off task. But, what if the teacher assigns the project about Mahatma Gandhi's struggles in his life? Students even if they lack interest in this topic, have to complete the project anyway. Lacking interests in a specific topic also lead students to a stage where they cannot contribute their 100% to their projects because this is what they don't have their interests in. Therefore, from their little amount of effort, they will not be able to obtain good amount of scores. Whereas, if the teachers themselves asks students to complete their own designed projects, students will never hesitate to provide their 100% effort to the project. This is so because, this would be about something they want to study more and research on. The more effort students put into their projects, the more better they score.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that the schools should require the summer projects to be student-designed and not to be teacher-designed because this helps the students to obtain more knowledge about the topic they enjoy.\n \n Student-designed projects captivates more attention of the students to research deeper and deeper. This eventually helps the students to get to know about that topic from its roots. The idea of Student-designed projects also assists students to achieve their goals, which eventually make them successful in their lives. Through much research, a certain field might get more interesting to a student than before. They might end up choosing that career. That is why, I believe that the schools should require students to design their own-designed projects.Â",

      "Throughout my adolescent past, I've had a vigorous number of summer assignments. Whether it was a Algebra 1 packet or a summer reading assignment, teachers never fail to overwhelm there students with work before the year even begins. Most summer assignmentsÂ are enforced by the teachers and lack any student input. A majority of students show little interest in the assignments they are presented and approach the work with a negative attitude rather than optimism. Although a student-designed summer project is a chance for students to exhibit there work in a more enjoyable fashion, a teacher-designed project would work better because teachers understand what work will best prepare students and shows the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.\n \n A reason why teachers should design the projects is because they understand what work will best prepare students. Many teachers have attained an advanced education in there subject. Unlike the students, the teacher knows exactly what the course will consist of, and the level of difficulty that they will cover. In most classes, students start the year with no prior knowledge of the subject they will cover. An example of there unpreparedness is that large portions of high school students switch out of classes because they don't know the level of the work that they will be covering.Â A student led project could be void of any important information. If they find an area of the subject thats more difficult than the others, they could address that area more than another part of the subject.Â Assignments created by teachers would be a prime opportunity for teachers to demonstrate the work they will cover, and help a student drop the class if the work seems too challenging. A summer assignment is before the year starts, so switching your classes wouldn't interrupt your school year.\n \n Another reason teachers should design the projects is because it shows what type of assignments will follow in the future. Teachers are a people of habit. Throughout the year, they will assign projects that are very similar to each other, following similar guidelines. An example of repetition in school is teachers assigning a variation of slide show presentations. Throughout the school year, many teachers conduct slide show presentations within new concepts. If a student were to design the summer project, it could be an entirely different format then any format suggested by a teacher. With the teacher in control, they could give you a project very similar to one that you may face in the future.\n \n Many believe that if enjoy what your doing, than you will be more productive. A student getting to choose what type of project they will do could introduce the topic in more exciting manner. While enjoying what you do is important, it may also not prepare a student to the best of it's capabilities. A student led project may not cover the ground that it needs to cover. For example, the students could decide to write a one paragraph reflection on an area of the subject that they found interesting. The problem with that format is that it may only tackle a small portion of the subject, and you wouldn't be able to reflect on what others found interesting, which would help you remember the information better.\n \n The teachers should design the project that the students work on. They know what work will best to prepare students and help them succeed. Teachers understand the subject far greater than any student designing the project. A more rigorous area of the subject could be addressed more in the project. If the teacher creates all of the future projects, than the summer project could reflect the type of projects teachers will assign in the future. Repetition is prominent within classrooms, and a summer assignment created by the teacher could offer incite into future projects. With a student in control of the project, they may only address a small area of the subject that will come up later in the year. While a student-designed summer project can make there work more enjoyable, a teacher-designed project would be better for students, because teachers understand what will prepare them best and is a way to discover the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.Â  Â",

They aren't going to make it something they dont want to do. Some might say the students aren't going to know what information to learn and use in the project. If teachers work with students they can figure out a way to make sure that they students learn all the information they need to. Teachers can even give them a rubric with all the information the students need to use.\n \n When you are doing something that you enjoy you stress about it less. Especially when you're on summer vacation doing a summer project is the last thing that you want to be doing. Kids would much rather hang out with friends or play video games. If students are designing the projects they will design something that is less time consuming or more easy to manage . While some agree with this others are concered that students would make the project too easy. Teachers at the end of the day are assigning the project, they can put guidelines and expectations on top of the students project design.\n \n During summer vacation lots of students will travel and go places with family. Students can figure out a way to involve family members making the project easier to do on the road. Having a parent help out on a project helps out and helps kids stress less. While doing a project with family members might distract students from learning some say doing a project with parents might help kids focus as well. No kid wants to mess around during a project with their parents.\n \n In conclusion, there are many benefits to allowing the students to design their own project. If students were to be allowed to design their own summer projects it would help students focus more on the project, it wouldn't be a super stressful project and students could involve their family.Â",

It will also help the teachers know more about their students, what they struggle with and what they understand.\n \n Students can be more creative and willing to do the project if they get to design it themselves. If its about something that is special to them they will put more effort into doing it. Most of the summer projects I got I didnt do because it didn't interest me at all. In English, they usually give out a summer reading list of books they want you to read. I would try to read the books that were on the list but they never made me want to finish it. If I had the oppertunity to pick my own books then I would read all summer.\n \n Letting students pick there own project would keep kids from cheating because if they have to pick their own topic then two kids can't write about the same thing the exact same way. Most students do their project at the last minute and schedules come out toward the end of summer. Therefore, they match their classes together or see if they have the same teacher and then they share answers before school even starts. Students shouldn't be given out packets with all the exact same questions because they will just cheat and learn nothing. Instead, we should be given projects that we get to pick.\n \n If we get to pick projects that mean somethng to us then the teachers can know more about who we are and not just by some packet with questions. Students could make projects about something that happened in their life or something that means a lot to them. Most teachers don't even care to know your name not to mentin who you even are. I still have teachers that ask me what my name is when they write a pass for me and i have been in school for almost 6 months. If students could do projects that mean something to them then maybe teachers would know who they are and not just some paper they are grading.\n \n In conclsion, Students should pick their projects and desgin the projects themselves. By letting students have a choice, It helps them and teachers too. The more creative students can be the more participation there will be.

They can also show their character and more about who they are. This can be a opportunity for students to open up with their teacher and classmates. Students can come out their comfort zone and be unique when creating their project.\n \n Second reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because students feel less pressured. If students have a certain project, they feel more pressured to do exactly what the project is based on. The project may be based on a subject they may not feel comfortable with. If students have a student-designed project, they will avoid that conflict because they will be able to choose their own topic. This may also pressure students because they could get a project that doesn't appeal to their personality.\n \n Third reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students responsibility. Students will have all summer to create their project; if the project is not done, it shows they aren't responsible. The project shows if they can be able to do a project before the new school year begins. Certain students will prove they're able to complete a project throughout the summer. While others will prove they aren't responsible enough to complete a project. In addition, this will give them a task to do while they aren't in school.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-based. My reasons on why I believe this should be a student-designed project is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility. A summer project should be a project you are comfortable with and can show how you unique every individual is. The project will also keep students feeling educated while not being in school.",

      "While on summer break, students typically do not enjoy being assigned school work. There is an ongoing debate over whether or not students should be able to design summer projects. Those who oppose this state that teachers should design student's projects, but this is not true. Although some may disagree students should be allowed to design summer break projects.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why students should design summer break projects. If students where allowed to design projects, one would be able to find an enjoyable topic to focus on. For example, instead of a book review, one could write about a destination they are visiting over the summer. This allows students to enjoy their summer break while still completing school assignments. The summer time is a time for rest; however, students still need to complete assigned projects. If students could design their own projects, one would feel more free and content; as a result, Leaving them with less stress and anxiety. Many students summers are very busy.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. There is an ongoing debate if these summer projects should be teacher- designed orÂ student- designed. Those that disagree state it's easier on yourself and brings out your own ideas and creativity, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be teacher- designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be teacher- designed. The teacher can challenge the students. For example, if I was assigned a project where I can pick my own topic I wouldn't do a lotÂ to where it's hard work. Furthermore, the teacher can also prepare you for next year and do the topic about something you're going to learn about. Doing a project of my own choice of topic wouldn't help me next year. Also, it lets the teacher see who can do it and who needs more time and help. Every year is different and working on a project designed by the teacher can help you get ready.\n \n There are further reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. One reason is to have a topic to the subject. Doing a project about my favorite song wouldn't help me with science. A teacher- designed project can also better your work. When your teacher assign a project about a topic your going to learn next year, you will already know about it because you did a project on it. Lastly, doing summer projects prepare your brain for school. Over the summer you can forget things and having a teacher- designed project can help remember.\n \n Although some mayÂ disagree, summer projects should be teacher- designed. This is the case due to better work, prepare you for next year, and challenge students. Those who disagree state it's easier on yourself and bring out your own ideas and creativity, but this is not true. This topic is important because it shows how some schools do better than other schools when they do summer projects. It makes other schools want to prepare their students for their upcoming year.",

      "What school summer projects have you ever done? How much do you think they have helped you? School summer projects have the capability to prepare students for a class and help students succeed. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student-designed because they will help students learn the material, students will perform better in the class, and students will retain the material for a longer time.\n \n School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students learn. If school projects are student-designed students will learn the required information for the class easier. Furthermore, this allows them to understand the material in greater depth, rather than if the projects were teacher-designed. Teachers should already understand the information for the class. This means, that if projects were teacher-designed it would not help the teachers anymore, because they are not the people completing the projects, and students will not benefit as much because the projects are not geared towards them.\n \n School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students perform better in the class. To get good grades in the class, students answer questions based on their unit of learning. Therefore, if students understand the material they will perform better on the tests. Student-designed projects help the students understand the material, so students will perform better on tests. Also, students who do better on the tests will enjoy the class more than students who do not do well on the tests. Students will also be happier with themselves if they have a good grade in the class.\n \n School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students retain the material for a longer time. Summer projects that are student-designed will not only help students understand the material for one test, but they will remember the material for the length of the course and possible even longer. Student-designed summer projects will help students retain the material for the rest of the course and any future courses that are related to the first course they took. This could also affect the workplace. Students who are taking a course related to their current job or a job that they are looking for in the future will have the material retained that will help them. This means that they have the ability to do well in their job, and they will make a good living for themselves and their family.\n \n Student-designed summer projects help students, the people who need it, to learn the material, rather than teachers, who should already know the material. Because students understand the material, they will perform better on tests and will be enjoy the class more and be happier with themselves. Also, students will retain the material for a longer period of time. That will make it easier for students in the rest of the course, and related courses they might take in the future, and current and future employment. Because student-designed summer projects help students learn the material, make students perform better on tests, and students retain the material for longer periods of time, schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student-designed.",

    essay:
      'Schools give many projects and homework assignments to assure the student knows the information, and it also gives them a chance to learn something new. Schools give projects during spring break, winter break, and even our longest break during the summer. Many of these projects are made or designed by a teacher, while some have a basic outline and are mostly designed by the students. Projects should be designed mostly by the students, and many agree with this statement as well.\n \n Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this makes the students strengths and weaknesses easier to indicate. This allows the teacher to understand what his/her students need help with. They can guide the student on how to perfect their strengths and improve on their weaknesses. An example of this would be if a student is bad at giving examples in essays. If the student is given an essay on "What was the most impactful battle of WWII" , they have many examples to choose from and many reasons those examples would be chosen. But if the student is given an essay on "Why should video cameras be used" , their mediocre examples will be easier to notice as not as many facts back up the opinions on if cameras should be used or not. Some may say since student-designed essays show the students flaws, their flaws could cause them to get a poor grade. While this is true in some cases, it is better the student\'s teacher see his/her mistakes now and help them improve on them, rather than before the big test. Although this is indeed one, there are many more examples of why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this allows more creative freedom and ideas on the essay/project. A student has free range to think of new ideas if they are not put on a metaphorical leash by the teacher. They can explore new ideas which in turn could make their essay much better and even teach the teacher something they never knew before. A satisfactory example of this would be if the teacher assigned an essay where the student could write about whatever they want, but they had to relate it to racism. The student could write about slavery, the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and they could even write about hip hop. But if the teacher tells the student to write an essay about " Why we read books" or " Why we eat food" the students will all have similar responses. They will say something along the lines of " We read books for the knowledge and information they give us" or " We eat food because food is a necessity our body needs to function properly". These essays/projects are very linear and do not bring anything creative to the table. A few may say that allowing full creative freedom on essays will cause students to drift away from the central idea of the essay and dive into personal opinion. Of course it is inevitable this will happen to some, good writers will know to not do this and will stay on the topic of their essay, while the writers who went astray will get some help from their teachers on how to improve that.\n \n Summer break projects should be mostly designed by students because this will encourage the student to do better on their essays/projects. Allowing freedom on a project allows the students to try as hard as they possibly can, while if they were given a project on something that disinterests them, they will only do what is required. If a student that is a fan of Lil Uzi Vert(rapper) is given a project on " The Evolution of Classical Music" , they are only going to do the minimum requirements of that project, while if they are given a project on Effect of Old Rap on New Hip Hop" , they will be more interested as it relates to something they hold dear. Some people may say that the students should already be encouraged to do the project since it is an important grade at the beginning of your school year, which is true, but some students need to be motivated in order to want to go the extra mile, and doing a project on one of your favorite artists is the right motivation.\n \n Summer break projects seem to have a negative vibe around them. Not many want to do them, and some think we shouldn\'t have them, but if we are going to have to do a project over the summer it should be about something e like or something we hold dear. Our families, our friends, our hobbies, our music taste, etc. Doing summer break projects on things that relates to us encourages us to do better, shows our flaws, and gives us freedom to run wild.Â',

    essay:
      "The concept of summer break presents many flaws to the school system. It causes students to lose vital information they learned the year prior and creates a lazy atmosphere with the absence of work. The clear solution to this is summer assignments and projects, yet some wonder who deserves to decide what the projects should consist of. Summer projects, a key tool to ensure continued enrichment, should be student designed to allow opportunities for creativity, increased enjoyment while working, as well as higher rates of motivation to continuously work on the project in order to nurture passion and a love for this work within students.\n \n During the school year teachers are obligated to obtain a set amount of grades and fit a certain curriculum, yet during summer these rules no longer apply. This leaves summer as the perfect time to allow for creativity with learning. One such example is the Sustainable Technology Class. This is a project driven class where students are given guidelines to fulfill and that is it. Many of the students taking this course have a passion for the material and need a chance to see all of the possibilities it can hold. With this class specific, originality could lead to a revolutionary invention, such as electricity generating bicycles or solar powered toys. Through this experience a student can truly fall in love with the world of science and decide to create a career out of it. A cpncept very similar to professors being able to do any research they can get approved within their budget. Also, including student led work could help school systems break the factory system pattern of the school year in which you do your assigned work and keep the classroom silent. Our current system, where students have very little say, easily leads to anxiety, exhaustion, and eventually, for some, fully dropping out of high school. By offering a chance to have a self designed, teacher approved project, students can fully appreciate knowledge in a way the benefits the individual.\n \n Once the door to creativity and choice has been opened, enjoyment has to follow. In 1800's France, a new style of art was emerging, impressionism. If these talented and famous painters, such as Monet and Van Gogh, solely followed the advice of their instructors and refused to step out to paint what they enjoy, we would not have beautiful works like Starry Night. If they had not branched out and followed their intuition and joy, they may never have continued painting due to constant belittlement of the art style they preferred. Our museums would be repetitions of the same work with very little diversity. This is true for essentially all art, another example of this is the Rock Revolution. If stars such as Elvis and the Beatles only followed the era of Big Band music and never were allowed to play and create what they enjoyed, music could have never evolved. With each generation, the world learns more and more. Advancements would never occur if every project was solely based off of the knowledge of the teacher.\n \n Finally, for the average student, September through June is an endless pattern of early mornings, tests, and work sheets created by their teachers. More importantly September through June is a pattern of procrastination for many students. Due to dread about a certain assignment or just plain boredom, work piles up and leaves the student to rush through it carelessly before the due date. A perfect example of this is Love Canal, New York. In the 1970's a community was built over a former dumping ground for radioactive waste. The families quickly noticed issues such as minor chemical burns from the grass and black sludge seeping into their houses, but the government ignored the growing tragedy. There was no action taken until 18 out of 21 children were born with severe chromosomalÂ defects. By this point, the government was forced to spend thousands of dollars in relocating the families as well as reparations, hospital bills, and environmental recovery. If they had not procrastinated, then it would have been considerably less expensive and would not have been as horrific as it ended up being. While this example may not directly highlight the issues within teacher driven projects, it does show what a consistent habit of procrastination can lead to. Which is what the school system instills in students by not allowing decision making. It is undeniable that when people care about the project being done, they are will put time and energy into it through out the whole experience, not just the ending.\n \n While there are some benefits to teacher driven projects, such as the possibility for concise instructions and often an obvious path to follow, these just allow the students to be overly protected and lazy. This prevents the potential for growth that comes from creating something and succeeding in it without the help of an adult. It also instills the idea that there will always be someone telling you what to do. Which is very harmful once these students get to the work field. They will be unprepared due to never doing fully original and individual work, and the school system would be the one to blame.\n \n In our modern world, we need innovation more than anything else. Young minds need to be nurtured, but also allowed to follow their own path of individuality and creativity. The only way to ensure the growth of these important traits is to loosen the leash and allow students to make some of the decisions. It is just one project per year, but a country wide switch could be revolutionary.Â",

      "Usually when school is out for summer break, you instantly forget about everything that you have learned. Nowadays, schools want you to do some of project or activity to assure that you have more knowledge and learning throughout the break. If these projects are really going to happen, they should be teacher-designed. If these projects are designed by teachers, then they are most likely going to be more educational, you can get hands-on help from a teacher, and overall they can allow you to become more prepared for the upcoming school year.\n \n Firstly, these summer projects should be teacher-designed because they can be more educational for the students. By doing this, you can learn many things that you never knew before. Such as ; a certain word problem, how to do an equation, or many other things as well. When the summer projects are finally over, you will be able to look back and see what all new information you have learned.\n \n Secondly, you can get better hands-on help from the teacher. Say one of the projects is about somethingÂ you have never seen or learned before. Obviously you are going to need to get help or a teacher's assistance. Instead of having to solve the problem by yourself, you can get someone's help so you can figure out what to do and how to do it.\n \n Thirdly, overall a project designed by a teacher will allow yourself to be be more prepared for the up and coming school year. If you have a project based on one of the classes you are going to take next year, you can start preparing based on that. You can start learning what the class is all about too. At the end of the day, no matter what type of activity or project it is, it will prepare you for the next school year.\n \n In conclusion, it is better for summer projects assigned by the school to be teacher-designed. In the end, they are way more educational than a project designed by a student them self. If you are not understanding something,or if it is difficult to complete, the teacher can help you out. Also in the long run, it will prepare and better yourself for the next school year.",

    essay:
      "In the summer, learning significantly decreases in students, so it's important to continue learning. Having a summer project is a great way to do so, but is it better to have the project designed by teachers, or the students themselves? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what is expected to be learned, it will be fair to the students, and teachers already have more experience in designing assignments.\n \n Teachers are already well informed about the curriculum about the subject they teach, and they also know some of the curriculum for the other classes related to the subject. For example, a math teacher for Algebra 1 has also taught Geometry in the past. Since he has experience in Geometry, he knows what his students should expect in the next year when they take Geometry. The students were only exposed to the content in Algebra 1, therefore making it more productive if the math teacher designed the summer project. By implementing content of the next school year into the summer project, students will be better prepared for the class. Because teachers teach the curriculum for the students, they know what is most important/useful to remember. For instance, a Biology 1 teacher knows that the unit focused on animal and plant cell anatomy is crucial to remember because it is always used in Biology in general, so she mostly focuses the project with cell anatomy. It is beneficial to students if they are informed what is expected to be to know in the future. Teachers who know what is most useful to know would design summer projects more 3ly by knowing what content to emphasize. Students do not know what is important to learn because they are in the process of learning, so having them design summer projects would not 3ly help them better prepare over the summer.\n \n If students are assigned to design a summer project, they are most likely to do something that is personalized to be easy for themselves with a lot of bias, which is not fair to everyone. Such as, English 10 students were expected to come up with comprehension questions for a book, and they ended up creating questions that were easy to them, but very difficult for other students. Students would not know how to create assessments that would cater to everyone's level of knowledge. Since teachers oversee the class, they would know what kinds of questions to create that would best fit for the class's knowledge, with no bias. If there was student bias involved in designing a project, many other students will have complaints and disagree with the components of the project. For example, a history teacher who assigned a project did not receive a single complaint compared to when a student proposed a project. If students know that the project was designed by the teacher, it will significantly decrease the amount of complaints and the students would just accept it because he is a higher authority. By having the teacher design the project, students will all have a fair assignment to do with no bias since it was designed by the teacher. Having students design a project could create a lot of disagreement.\n \n Teachers have more experience in teaching and the basics of learning. They have traditionally always created and designed assignments in the past. For instance, a Psychology teacher has been teaching for over ten years knows how to create 3 projects for his students. Since he has been teaching for over ten years, he has more experience and knows what he is doing. People with more experience can design better quality projects than someone who is still learning, Teachers know what techniques to use to 3ly assess knowledge. An example is that an English teacher added more steps for annotating a book because she knows that it actually helps students understand the book better. A student would not like to add more steps in annotating a book because it is more work, but they do not know that is is very helpful in the long run. The process of learning is more likely to be 3 if the assignment was designed by a teacher because they have more experience. It is important for students to learn with purpose and practice beneficial habits.\n \n If teachers designed summer projects, it would be beneficial to the students' learning. It would ensure that students are learning the correct information needed, would be be just for all the students, and it would be more efficient since teachers have more experience. The purpose of summer projects is to continue learning in students over the break, and teachers definitely have the power to do that.",

      "Summer projects, some schools have these projects to complete during the summmer so students do not have to completley stop learning during the break. The assignments are more than likely created by a teacher; What if the students created the assignments though?\n \n i believe that if student's created the project it would probably be easier than a teachers project, for the benefit of summer. On the other hand if teachers designs the project it will come with more work and more information for the benefit of real learning.\n \n Student designed projects, in my opinion, will probably help teachers in the short run because of the fact that teachers will not have to worry about creating a project. In the long run though, i believe students will not learn anything new. i think student's will just create it and make it easy just to get it over with and begin their summer. Or make it easy enough to just procrastinate about it all break and complete it at the end of summer. Even creating the project is more work for the students which i think will have some students not even trying to do it. If the project is created by students i think mostly all of the students will complete it and turn it in because of how easy they made it to be.\n \n Teacher designed projects, These projects will have what the teacher's and school want students to study during break. Teachers will actually create it to be work that will leave students with information that is needed and that should not be forgotten, for future puposes like for classes that they will be taking when back from break. I think a good amount of people would not complete the assignment due to the fact that teachers make them hard and actually have you do work. Students would rather be doing anything than a project during the summer. Teacher designed projects will help students out more in the long run because teacher's know what students need to study and focus on.\n \n So, in my opinion a teacher designed project is for the benefit of the student's learning. A student designed project though, is for the benefit of the student's summer. In both cases though the student is going to be working on it thoughout summer and keeping in touch with learning. I think it would be best if a teacher designed project was given for the summer. If the chance was given to me to create one though, i would definetly rather do that.Â",

      "In some schools, summer projects are assigned to assure that students will continue learning well after the school year ends. Although students should continue to learn during their break, some have argued that if the projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed is the better option because students will have more options to chose from, they can do a project they're interested in, and teacher-designed projects are annoying to produce.\n \n Many teachers would complain that students won't have any directions to follow on their projects and will thus not continue learning during their break. Although, students not having any directions on how to make their projects is true. This can be viewed as a purely subjective point, since this'll give students more freedom on how they want their projects to be. Another point of discussion is is that students won't continue to further learn during their break. This viewpoint that students won't continue to learn is wrong due to the fact that students will be learning while creating their projects.\n \n Having more options for students to choose from is great because students can create a project of something they're interested in with high effort. In the past, teachers would only give students one option for a project idea; therefore, limiting the chance of something that student would interested in and lowering the effort. For example, if a student was given the freedom to write about a certain sport they're interested in, they could make a well informed slide show to present to a class or could talk forever about their favorite team in a podcast. A student would choose to write something they're interested rather than having to read a long book than having to write a big essay any day.\n \n Students can make projects more enjoyable is a valid point because it can show their creativity. Since students won't have any directions on how to make their projects, they can be as creative as they want. They can try out new ways to present projects like showing a cool infographic or make a fun video that can inform a class about a topic they worked on. This could make the actual work process of the project more enjoyable to the student and whoever they're presenting it too.\n \n The third reason why student-designed is the better option is because teachers can make projects annoying for the students. Teachers can sometimes make students go out of their way to work on their projects. To include, teachers can make it so students have to visit somewhere to get information to further continue working on their projects or make students have to buy certain books to write about. This may not seem so bad at first glance; however, for some students who go visit out of the country for the majority of the break can be a nightmare for them. Imagine a student being gone for the majority of the break just to come back and only have a little less than week to visit a musesum and write an essay about it. This situation shows how teachers make projects annoying for these types of students.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project is better because students can choose what they want to talk about, projects would be more enjoyable for everyone, and students won't have to go out of their way from teacher-designed projects. Having more freedom in options leads to students picking something they're interested in.\n \n Students also show their creativity thus making it more enjoyable. finally, teachers make students go out of their way for projects; therefore, making it annoying for some students who travel.",

      "Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughoutÂ the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.\n \n Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.\n \n Almost all teachers a facultyÂ spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.\n \n A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.\n \n If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. IfÂ assignmentsÂ must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power pointÂ on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during theÂ upcomingÂ school year\n \n Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them. This is why students should be able to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a desire to do the work.Â Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed because an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, they are less restrictive, and students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.\n \n A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. For instance, a lot of the projects in school are tied to a specific topic. When it comes to choosing the type of project, at a first glance, there may seem like there is a lot to choose from. But in reality, this is just the illusion of choice. There isn't a lotÂ of room for creativity and imagination, therefore there isn't much freedom. Many individuals will agree that with more freedom, they have the liberties and creativity to come up with something that is unique. Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn, But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point.\n \n Student-designed projects are less restrictive. For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade.\n \n individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects. A project can seem like a large and outstanding task to finish for a large amount of students, and as a result, puts stress on an individual. A student-designed project can relieve plenty of this stress, as students can choose a subject that they are best at. It is easier for someone as they are more comfortable with a topic they are more knowledgeable with. Other individuals may argue that students should make an effort to choose a subject they aren't familiar with, but many can disagree because choosing a topic someone isn't familiar with puts more stress on a person and can lead to them struggling to learn.\n \n Summer projects help students learn during the break, but students should ultimately decide on designing their own projects for individuals to continue to learn. At the end of the day, they should have the freedom to enjoy doing what they are best at they shouldnt be stressed over work they aren't comfortable with in the summer.Â  Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Teachers design the worst summer projects ,in some schools it is required that students should complete a summer project to make sure thatÂ they are still learning something during their break ,but some schools give out summer projects that the teacher design. Most students would agree that student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways such as they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity abilities,and the students may be really be interested in the project that they are doing.\n \n First,when teachers assign a summer project it might be something that the student may not know or can not get a grasp of because it is too difficult for them to understand. And in some cases if it is too difficult for them the chances of them just giving up and not trying areÂ pretty high. That is why if they pick their topic or subject for their project it may lead to a better outcome. Then you will see a lot more from that one students project.\n \n Second,summer projects are for people with creative minds and want to do so much to their project and make it look nice,but they would have to be limited mainly because it has to go by what the teacher assign. But if that is the case then if the teacher did notÂ choose the project then the creativity would go through the roof due to the many of creative minds of students and they would be limitless. And the outcome of the summer project would look stunning.\n \n Finally,when given the project from the teacher it may come to a surpriseÂ that some students may not be interested into that one subject or topic that they are learning,so they would lose interestÂ in the whole project and not put effort into it. But if it is for a topic or subject that they are interested in and that they can choose the teacher would fully capture their interest and the student may put effort into the project. And if they know so much about that one thing then you are sure going to see a lotÂ of things down on that project.\n \n One can argue that this is not a good idea for students on choosing their project one reason one could say is that it may lack focusÂ ,that this curtain thing wont help them in life, and that they need to know more important things in school so that is why teachers would assign these projects for the teacher to know the understandings of their students.\n \n So in conclusion, student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways that they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity,and the students may be really interested in the project that they are doing. And this can help them do more well in school due to that one summer project.",

      "Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests.\n \n Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique.\n \n Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughoutÂ the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of.\n \n In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like.\n \n As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it.\n \n Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to designÂ it and stride for their best educational experience.Â  Â Â Â",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.\n \n If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new.Â Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.\n \n The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.\n \n Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.\n \n Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseveranceÂ and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.\n \n We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",

      "Summer Projects for school should be Teacher-designed because it will show students the expectations for the course, helps them learn the specific material that is needed, and keeps students on track. The main part of summer projects is to assure that students continue their learning process. While schools have long breaks at a time, it is difficult to come back and still remember all of the things that was taught before being let out for a long amount of time. Teachers and student both struggle to jump back into the schedule of going to school each day. Many students have a hard time maintaining everything after being a way and not looking at the material for a while. Some schools require students to complete assignments or projects during a long period break to maintain their learning abilities, but if students are not given the right objective, then they are bound to not learn anything. There are many examples on why summer projects should be teacher-designed.\n \n First, students need expectations and requirements for school projects because it shows them what the teacher will be looking for while grading. This can relate back to whenever a teacher is gone for a period of time or is absent for the day and tells the students what is expected of them while the teacher is away. Having expectations and requirements for a project makes sure that the student puts in effort and that the assignment is detailed with the right topics. While students are working on an assignment, and essay, or a project, they do tend to lead their way off topic and start to write about unnecessary details. Having a list or a checklist of things that are expected of each student helps them know what needs to be on it and it is easier to follow.\n \n Most students have said that they prefer checklist and requirements than anything else because it is helpful to check off instructions and make sure that everything that is needed is on the assignment.\n \n Next, having students keep the learning process going during the summer with help their growing minds, but if they are not given the right topics and material then they will be confused and would have not learned a single new thing. With projects, students are suppose to make the assignment talk and discuss a main point of a topic. Teachers usually make projects as specific as possible, if the student was told to do it themselves then it would be easy for them to not go into detail and specifics about anything. In school, most topics have a huge variety of smaller details and information that would not be a main point in assignments and projects. Students would have to follow what the teacher wants to make sure that they do not write down the wrong information. Most of the time, when a teacher designs a project, they usually give a variety of tools and websites to go to if they need more information on something. Those websites and tools will give the specific examples and info on what the topic is based on and it will help the students have a better knowledge of the main point.\n \n Lastly, after focusing on one main topic for a long time, students tend to get bored and not try as hard as they should. Some students have a hard time staying on track while doing something school related on their own, they usually need some guidance to follow and go by. If summer projects were student-designed, the students would not be able to follow what they need to do and would not have any rules to go by. Different students have different ways of learning, some like to do hands on activities or web questsÂ to learn, others just prefer to write down everything that they learn as notes. A teacher-designed project can give different ways of portraying the material. A teacher-designed project will also make students be on time with the assignment. If a teacher assigns a summer project, they will most likely attach when specific things are due at what time, for example: the essay portion will be due in 2 weeks, the rough draft is due in 1 week, the poster with the end result is due the first day of school. Most big projects that take a while to finish will have smaller tasks to finish throughout of period before it is due. Teachers can tell if students are on the right track if they assign things during the process of working on the project.\n \n In other words, having a student designed summer project is not a great idea. If students made the project by themselves, the teacher could become confused while trying to figure out the main topic. Students would not follow any sort of guideline unless a teacher attaches it to the assignment. If the project was not designed by a teacher, then the student making it would not be great with knowing when to put deadlines and they would not be sure with what to put on the project. The summer project will most likely be done much sooner because made it clear when things will be due. If it was made by a student, they will more likely slack off and be lazy with portraying the assignment. A teacher-designed summer project would be the most efficient way to stay on track with deadlines, to know what to talk about or not, and it shows the requirements and expectations that the teacher wants to see.

      "As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed. When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. This allows students to base their project on something that they are heavily interested in, others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with, and lastly it motivates them to complete their assignment with passion.\n \n It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult. However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view. When picking topics for a project, most students are inclined to base it on something that they have a liking for. When I was in middle school, I was part of a program called the\n \n Gifted and Talented, this program was centered on both, group and individual projects. We had been assigned a project in honor of Earth Day and due to my immense love and interest for marine life, I had decided on creating a vessel that would roam the ocean and detect any trash that had been tossed into the water, and collect it. After I had researched where most ocean trash was found, I had decided that this vessel would remain near beaches and ports. If the teacher had designed the project and told us that we had to create something on a specific topic such as, prevention of forest fires, there could have been a chance that I hadn't been as enthused and wouldn't have tried as much.Â Not only did this project help me think outside the box, but it also helped me decide on my future career by allowing me to research more on a topic that I was interested in.\n \n Furthermore, instead of sticking with something familiar, students might try and explore other topics in which they lack knowledge. By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life. I once new a woman who arrived at college \"undecided\". She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosingÂ by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.\n \n By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.\n \n Lastly, when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking. It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion. For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing. OriginallyÂ I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it. In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project. At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had. I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month. By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night. In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later.\n \n All in all, student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature. When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success. Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind. Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class. However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning. Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in. When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about.Â",

    essay:
      "Summer is a time for student to have a long deserved break from school. During this time, however, some students become unable to no longer retain their knowledge and have to recover prior knowledge starting the next school year. To compensate, some schools assign summer projects for the students to be proactively accomplishing. Whether it be a project that they get to design or a teacher designs for them. The main argument here is \"what is better\" for the learning experience of the student. A project created and designed by a student over the summer is better than a teacher designed one because the project will be more engaging for the student, the student will have full control, and the student will have easier time learning or their own accord.\n \n A student who designs their own summer project will have a engaging experience with their project. As a student, the ability for a project to be fun to do and still be a good learning experience is number one. Having your own project to do gives you the sense that you know what you're capable of accomplishing. It will be engaging because student will get to interact in their own methods and ways. Learning in this way helps students to retain information and maybe learn about something they may have never thought about. An engaging project made by the students will also give the students a means of commitment to do the project if it is fun to do and is beneficial for them academically. Engagement in a project is the best way for a students to want to be able to drive their passion in learning forward, without the hassle of abiding by the teacher's rules and regulation of the project. Giving students the right to build their own project makes the learning part fun and engaging for the students, which will overall provide them with possibly of better academic achievement and retention.\n \n Students with full control their project will be able to make it a project they will be proud of. Full control means that students will be able to go though the steps of conception, planning/design, making/prototyping, and possibly revision on their own. Giving students the leveraging control, builds the sense that they understand the topic the most and that they should be able to complete the project under their own goals and ideas. This helps to build skills in learning and retaining information taught. With full control, they will also have the necessary time to complete their project on their own without the overlooking burden of a teacher telling them what to do exactly. This removes the unnecessary stress of designing a project to meet someone else's goals and hoping that it will meet their specifications. A student, given this freedom of choice and design, will be able to learn more about something that they enjoy learning about, it makes the overall experience better for them and also builds their design processes to be better efficientÂ and less costly to them. These skills learned from being in full control of a major project can be used in schools and possibly be used later in the workplace or any other setting that puts them under control of a project.\n \n The last argument is that students will have an easier time of learning when they get to make it. Without the teacher being in the way, not only will the student be hopefully, less stressed, but also put them in charge of learning. Being able to self pace yourself, will help to slowly build up information into your mind and retain that information for longer when you may have to use it one day in the near future. Without the regulations of an authoritative teacher, students build projects under their ideas. As long as the project is providing the student with educational content that they will learn from, they will be able to enjoy it, which removes the boring parts of learning about a certain subject and instead, make it fun to learn about and understand. Students building up the knowledge slowly by themselves, will slowly integrate the information into their mind slowly, without overwhelming students with complex research projects or projects dealing with hard to reach goals assigned by the teacher. A student who learns by themselves may be smarter and less worried by the goals of a project than a student who has to follow the rules and regulations word for word from the teacher. Students that get to design the projects themselves will overall have an easier time understanding and learning.\n \n A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is 3ly gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will help them excel academically.\n \n To wrap up, projects under the design of a student will be better than a teacher designed one because the students are better engaged in their own projects, the students will have full control of their project and everything that goes into it, and the students will have an easier time comprehending/learning at their own pace. Schools that assign summer projects know that the real intent is to help keep the students proactive in their studies over the summer break, and these projects are suppose to help them do so. Student designed projects will be a better option for schools since it gives the students choice in their education. And that profound statement, gives students a better chance at starting off the next school year with information ready to be used.Â",

      "As the school year comes to a close, countless students look forward to spending their days relaxing by the pool, going on vacation, and hanging out with their friends. For some, however, the beginning of summer break also means preparing for the next school year. Summer assignments are common among advanced high school classes, and are equally dreaded by most high school students. Moreover, teacher-designed projects do not spark much interest from those who must complete them. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should allow students to design their assignments because it promotes responsibility, keeps students interested, and provides more opportunities for students in school and in the future.\n \n When completing an assignment over the summer break, students are responsible for setting time aside in order to work and study. A good sense of responsibility is an essential part of designing a project and making sure it gets done. When crafting a project, students are responsible for creating their own ideas and implementing them correctly, in order to create an interactive and challenging assignment. Without good time management skills, a student may fall behind, leaving them with a sub par project, and most likely a disappointed teacher. Allowing a student to take the lead on designing a project will promote the necessary components of learning good time management. As well as time management, a student also learns how to balance priorities. Yes, summer is an amazing opportunity to have fun, but it also provides the means to be better prepared for the school year. When a student decides to prioritize a summer project over a video game or TV program, they set themselves up for future success in the form of a high grade. Focusing on one's priorities teaches them a great deal of responsibility, and can be applied to many different situations in the future. Allowing a student to design their own project teaches them how to 3ly manage their time and understand their priorities, leading them to become more responsible.\n \n When a student learns or studies about something they are interested in, they are able to absorb more information. Letting a student design their own project will assist in a more powerful learning experience. If a student who was interested in trains received a project about frogs, chances are he/she would quickly become disinterested and bored. A student would perform far better on an assignment that their interests can be applied to. A student designed project promotes creativity, as well as sponsoring individuality. Moreover, it is almost impossible for a teacher to design a project that caters towards all the needs and interests of his/her students. A student-lead project would return higher grades and provide a way for a teacher to further understand each of her students, the way they learn, and their personal interests. This allows for a stronger relationship between a teacher and /his/her class, and creates a more beneficial learning environment. The decision to allow students to design their own projects will make for a more impactful, enjoyable, and interesting learning experience.\n \n Lastly, a student-designed project will provide more opportunity for students to expand their network, and discover what they want to study and achieve in the future. When working on a project or assignment that is based off the personal interests of an individual student, they could be inspired to study further into their chosen subject, and provide them with an idea of what they want in the future. A student who studies trains could soon realize that he/she is more interested in planes, and now wants to be a pilot. They could also be influenced to join a school club or get a job that pertains to their chosen subject. The ideas that they create when designing their own project can be applied to their goals for the future. As well as providing ideas for their career and future studies, they will also be able to expand their network of people who have the same aspirations as them. Designing a project allows for one to work with many different people, such as a partner or group, and offers the means to build new relationships and acquaintances. The idea of a student-designed summer project is more 3 in expanding a student's knowledge of personal goals, and provides an environment with many opportunities to meet new people and discover new ideas.\n \n In conclusion, the benefits of a student-designed project are far greater than those of a teacher-designed project. Students learn new skills, such as responsibility and time management. They are also provided with opportunity to expand their knowledge, discover their interests, and discover themselves as an individual. The people they meet and work with throughout designing and completing a summer project will benefit them in school, further studies, and possibly even the work force. The idea of a student-designed project proves itself to be a more beneficial, rewarding, and fun experience.Â  Â Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn'tÂ know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.\n \n Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn'Â be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.\n \n Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher-designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed.",

    essay:
      'Some schools that require students to complete summer projects to assure kids continue to learn over break is a smart idea. Yet, the question "Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student- designed?" Can determine if a student will enjoy and do the work that they are assigned. These projects should be student-designed because this will cause a higher percent of students to do the work, while enjoying the experience, students can learn about something that they want, and teachers will be able to learn about the new students coming to their class.\n \n There is always a problem with kids not doing their assigned work. Starting off the year with a incomplete project could ruin the year for some. If students were allowed to design the project, they would be choosing topics that they are likely to complete, and ones that they can enjoy. There is a direct correlation with kids who enjoy the topic they are learning about and completion rate of projects. Student-designed projects may lead to a higher percent of kids doing their work and less kids pushing off projects till the last minute. This can assure that kids will be learning the matirial over summer break.\n \n Projects don\'t always have to be strictly information that we cover in school, sometimes it is good to learn about something that interests the individual. With student-designed projects, students will have the freedom to chose what they want to learn about. Giving this opportunity to students will allow them to show their interests to teachers and their peers. Having kids focus on something they find interesting, increases their drive to learn new information, which will help them throughout the upcoming school year.\n \n Student-designed projects will not only benefit students, teachers will learn about new students as the school year starts. Having teachers learn about students can help build important teacher-student relationships. Teacher-student relationships are important to develop throughout the year, so students feel they have a safe place to go if they need help or if they have had a bad day. Many students tend to have hard times learning from teachers they dont respect, or like. Projects that are student-designed will increase the trust kids have in their teachers, as well as teachers about new students.\n \n While some teachers and school officials may not be in favor of student-designed projects because it could be hard to grade if the teacher does not know the topic being presented. Many people would argue that students should not be the only people learning new things. Teachers should be able to learn about topics the students are interested in to better the way they interact with students. Although, teachers might not be experts on these topics, grade should not be on the information, rather on the way the student presents the information and how they researched each topic.\n \n While the answer to teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects can be up for debate their are many reason to why a student-designed project are better than teacher-designed project. The level of completion, student interest, and allowing for better teacher-student relationship are all very important to assure that students will continue to learn over break.Â',

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.\n \n Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.\n \n Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.\n \n Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.\n \n In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer?Â",

    essay:
      "Imagine you just finished your sophomore year of high school. Summer has finally arrived! The whole Summer is yours for you to do anything and everything you want to do... except for your Summer assignment. In one class, your teacher has assigned you to run a specific research project that encompasses all the main ideas of the subject. In another class, the teacher has given you the assignment of designing and completing your own project. You sit down and think. Which one of these projects will teach me the subject better? Summer project assignments should be designed by the teacher of the course's project since it would avoid students designing projects that are not challenging enough, teachers know the subject better, and they are trained to give the right assignments for 3 teaching.\n \n First and foremost, high school students are known to avoid the heavier workload if given the choice of a lighter one, even if the heavier workload will benefit them in the long run. For example, I've had the experience of having a history class assign more work one year, and the next year's history class assign less. In the class with more projects and work given, I learned the material more thoroughly and can still apply the material I learned to other situations. On the other hand, I can't remember much of the material from the class that gave me less work and projects. Though I enjoyed the lighter class, I learned that more work is equivalent to a better understanding of the subject. This, therefore, means that students, with their preference for less work, would not benefit from designing their own project since they'd simply design a light and extremely easy project.\n \n Another reason why teachers should design Summer projects is that they know the subject they teach better than the students they are assigning the project to. Teachers, apart from having learned and gone through the same classes as the students they teach, have also gone to college and studied the subject in a lot more depth for years. They simply know more than the student and know what projects helped them, as students, learn the material. A chemistry teacher, for example, is going to know what project to give to students in order for the student to learn chemistry since the students haven't even taken the class yet. Students do not know what projects will teach them 3ly.\n \n Additionally, teachers have gone through years of schooling and college to get to the position they are in, as well as probably having years of teaching experience. They have been trained to teach students 3ly and know what methods of teaching work best. This also means that teachers know which projects and what approach to projects are best for students. In my science class one year I had the option of designing and running my own experiment. I chose the easiest option and ended up doing badly since there were no instructions or guidelines for the experiment. I did learn from my mistakes and having to teach myself the subjects related to the experiment, but the experiment was mostly a fiasco. I learned the subjects a lot better when my teacher gave us a project that had clear intentions and guidelines that guided us to the main lesson we were being taught rather than just a project of doing whatever thrown at us. Teacher usually knows best.\n \n After a few moments of thinking, you come to the conclusion that teacher-designed projects teach you better and more 3ly. Yes, you as a student do know how you yourself learn better than a teacher knows how you specifically learn. Yes, students can also learn from the process and mistakes of designing a project, but the truth is that the likelihood of at least the majority of students putting the effort into their project to put these ideas into account is very low. Teachers know how to teach and what projects to give to students to 3ly teach. Now, you sit down and start your projects.",

      "Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.\n \n Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.\n \n Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do. Teachers are the ones ensuring that their students are prepared and know the material, and it is their responsibility to prepare their students for their curriculum. At the end of the day, the students are not the ones getting paid to teach their students.",

      "Should students have the ability to create their own projects to further their own education during the summer; or should the instructor give a teacher-designed project?Â Students should be able to make their own student-designed project. They have a say in their own education, especially when it comes to their summer break.Â Unlike teachers; students know their own limits when it comes to stress. Teachers tend to give more and more work to 'help' their students, when they are really hurting their mental state. Although, some students are proven to be less responsible than others, they are able to realize what they can and can't do. Yes, continuing student's education over the summer might be the best for them, but is it really worth stressing them out?\n \n Summer time for teachers and students, is a time for them to have fun and relax. Why have the teacher do the project on their break, when their students can do so in a way that they enjoy? Students are capable of creating a project that is fun and helps them learn new things on the way. Teachers meanwhile, might tend to put their own stress in the work, due to their break being cut down for a project. Many people tend to see students in a bad light. Such as, irresponsible, lazy, and forgetful. Rather than putting them in this bad light, we can give them a chance to choose their own learning style over the summer. Is summer break really about having fun or just having work?\n \n Many adults and teachers tend to see students in a bad light; such as: irresponsible, lazy, and forgetful. When in reality it is due to them not being motivated. When there is a chance; like this, to give a student a way to teacher themselves in their own unique way. Self-motivation is what most 'lazy' or 'irresponsible' students need when it comes to their own education.

Why constantly putting students in a bad life for their past behavior, when we have a chance for them to give themselves some motivation when it comes to school work?\n \n When the time hits for summer, teachers and students want to relax, but also continue learning at the same time. Teachers tend to not realize their students limits when it comes to work. Students need self-motivation when it comes to school work sometimes. To help their education and stress levels, why not let students make their own project for the summer, for their benefit?",

    essay:
      "Summer projects, although tidious and time consuming, are important. They are given to students by teachers to allow the students to retain the knowlege they have previously learned. They might also be given to teach the students new concepts before they enter the new school year. This allows teachers to teach a new concept at a faster pace since the students already taught it to themselves over the break. These project are very common in higher level classes because they require a higher level of understanding. These projects should be student-designed. I think that student-designed projects are a more efficient way for students to learn the required material over the summer break. It gives the students the flexibility that teacher-designed projects don't give. This is because students can design the project to their specific learning style and schedule and it allows the students to explore their creative side.\n \n If students design their own projects they have the ability to cater to their own learning needs. Some students are visual learners. Some benefit from repitition. Each student is vastly different from next. For example, if someone knew that they were a visual learner, they could draw pictures about the topic that they are learning about. They could illustrate a storyboard about a major war or make a cartoon about how to solve a math problem. They would not benefit from making flashcards and memorizing words because their brain deems those tactics boring. When someone's brain recognizes something as fun and enjoyable, it is more awake and ready to work. This also allows the students who don't know the best way that their brain retains information to explore and find what works best for them. This could help students in the long run by making them aware of what tactics they can use to study for tests.\n \n Students, especially high school and college level ones, usually have extremely full schedules. On the days they don't have extracurricular activities, they have work or home responsibilities. The range of what keeps a student busy is enormous. From a part-time job to band practice, students are overwhelmed with endless responsibilies. Allowing students to design their own summer projects gives them the ability to set their own work load. This takes some of the pressure off and still gives them the time to focus on other things in their lives. If a student only has two hours in their day to do school work, they won't design a project that requires them to research a topic for three hours a day and then write about it for two more hours. They will make something that allows them to research a quick topic and write a short paragraph so they can get in their eight hours of sleep.\n \n Schools focus on challenging their students academically and they champion the students who thrive in the athletic department. Schools usually fail to give any attention to the students who excel in being creative and having problem solving skills. Student-designed school projects would allow those students to thrive in making up a unique and efficient way to learn a new concept. It would also be beneficial to the students who struggle in that area, allowing them to practice and explore new ideas. As a student who stuggles in being original and creative, I would be forced to research new ways of learning. It would make me practice thinking outside of the box which is an important skill that can be applied outside of a school setting and in the workplace.\n \n Although student-designed projects allow students to make projects to their specific learning style and schedule and allows the students to explore their creative side, there are also things that teacher-designed projects are more efficient at. Teacher-designed projects make sure that what is needed to be learned, is actually learned. If a student designs their own project based on a broad topic, they may miss key terms or ideas that are essential to understanding the whole topic. When a project is guided by the teacher's instructions, students are less likely to be confused. There is also the chance that a student designs a project so they do not have to do any work. They can make one that requires them to only write their name on a piece of paper. Most projects are already teacher-designed and not many people have trouble understanding them. If students were to start designing their own projects it may leave students confused and unprepared for their class when the school year starts.\n \n I think that teacher-designed projects can be beneficial, but not to every student. Allowing the students to make their own projects makes certain that every student will learn the material in their own style and at their own pace. When teachers design projects, many students don't understand and are left behind. Even though some students may design a project that is incredibly simple, not all students want self-sabatoge like that. Most students understand that summer work can set them up for success during the school year. I think that the pros outweigh the cons on allowing students to design their own summer projects. Student-designed projects allow students to learn by their own style, learn at their own pace, and explore and implement their creative ideas.Â",

      "When was the last time you have been assigned a project over summer break? My last summer project was this past summer. It was a history project that took me days to complete. All I remember was dreading to work on the project because I already knew the information that it was about. Instead of the summer project being only a review, it should have been both a review and new information. Students get bored learning the same thing over and over again. They need something to help them for the upcoming year as they enter a new class. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because students would learn better, use their creative ability, and be more motivated to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should not be about keeping the student busy. They should be about preparing the student for the new class along with helping the student retain past information. If the projects were student-designed, then students would be more likely to learn better. When I was in tenth grade, our task was to create our own project based off a certain number of topics that were given to us. I chose to do my project about World War Two. Since I chose something that I am interested in, I learned a lot of new information and information that I already knew. If I was assigned a project about old civilizations, then I probably wouldn't have learned as well as I did. This is a prime example showing how a student-designed project will help a student learn better.\n \n Creativity is something that is difficult to express for students. There are very little opportunities to express who you really are in school. Every small chance that a student gets to show their personality is an opportunity. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed. Furthermore, if a summer project was student-designed, then that student will have a ton of opportunities to create something that represents them. For example, an artsy student might pick a project that involves drawing or painting. An athletic student might pick a project that involves a challenge. Finally, a studious student might do a project that has a lot of work. The possibilities are endless. Having each and every student express who they are can inspire many in and out of school. This is only the second reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n The last reason summer projects should be student-designed is because the students would be more motivated to complete the project. Summer is the only time that students have a long-tern break. They don't think about school or learning too often. The last thing they want to think about is another project that their teacher assigned to them. Their motivation to complete this project is very low. The only way to help motivate students would be to allow the project to be student-designed. It needs to be a project that they will enjoy doing. It can't be just another project that the teacher assigns just because why not. Last year, in chemistry, I was allowed to pick my project for my end of year science research project. I picked a topic that I wanted to see the outcome of. Throughout the entire project, I was motivated to complete it. This is because I chose what I wanted to do. Some people might say that a student can be motivated to complete a project even if it is teacher-designed. The counter to this is that when a student designs a project that they are interested in, the likelihood for that student to complete the project increases greatly. This is because they know what they want to learn about and what is interesting for them. Every little bit of motivation can help a student learn more than they thought.\n \n As you can see, student-designed projects are way better than boring teacher-designed projects. These were only just a few reasons why student-designed projects are better. Now that you know which one is better, I encourage all people to advocate around their community to make this a reality. Every student should be able to do a project on what they want to learn about. If we all used our voice to express our thoughts, then our planet would be a much better place in and outside of school.",

      "Some schools are required to assign assignments to their students to do a summer project during their summer break, but I believe that students should'nt be required to have summer projects. And I also believe that student should have a student-designed say in this because it's their choice based on if they would rather have summer assignments or not. I get it teachers want students to have summer assignments so that they're still learning but if students have assignments during their time off is that even summer break if students still have to do work during thier break.\n \n One reason why I believe that students should'nt have summer projects is because it is summer and student just want to enjoy their break and have fun. Student should have a say in this is because it's their choice if they would like to do summer projects or just enjoy and relax. I think most student would rather pick having fun and relaxing over summer projects, because for nine months students are going at least to 7 classes for nine months and learning new things, also doing projects, homework, classwork and more. If students had to have a vote for summer assignments or having a summer break without any summer projects, the majority of the students would pick summer break without any summer projects.\n \n Another reason why I believe students should design summer projects is because some students might get overwhelmed and very stressed out. School can be really stressful especially if you're failing some of your classes and getting a lot of work. Another reason why I think school is stressful is because you have seven classes and most teachers asign assignments to their students, this can be stressful for students because they have a lot of work to finish and some assignment are due the next or next class and they have to think about their other class assignments. Most students have a job and they won't have time to their summer assignment or they either went to vaction because summer time is about relaxing and having no worries, it should be a stress free summer. Summer is a time to enjoy while there is no school or no work assignments, summer break is a time to spend time with family and go to fun places and explore new things and places, not just doing school work while it is summer break.\n \n The final reason why I believe that student should have a say in summer project is because students should have a good time off. Students should'nt have summer projects because some students might go to summer school and have to do more work on top of summer projects, while they're doing summer school work , it could lead to some students not doing the summer project because summer school is too much stress for them. When student are in school they aren't really going on vaction or they aren't going out as much having fun because of school. The majority of the student don't want to miss school because if they miss school for a day it can back up them up from learning and not knowing anything that is going on in class. And summer break is about going out on vaction and exploring new things and adventure's, also not having to worry what time they have to be home for school or doing any assignment because it is summer break they should be able to enjoy it until school starts again. The majority of students don't go out on school day or during the weekends because they're either busy, working or just don't have time, that's why we have summer break so that we can relax and have fun and not worry about summer assignments.\n \n In conclusion these are the three main reasons as to why I believe that students should be students should not be assigned summer projects , so that they can enjoy their summer vaction off and being stress free until school starts again, I also believe that all students and staff should have off so that they all get a break and time off to relax and have family time.Â",

      "For most, summer is filled with unwinding from the stresses of school, traveling to new places, and learning new skills. This break is given to students to relax and reflect on all of their hard work. Summer allows students to find activities that they are passionate about. Summer assignments should be student-designed because this allows students to determine the extent and length, the topic, and the platform the project will take place on. This break in between moving onto the next level of education is meant for students to distress and enjoy life outside of school. Surely, making the summer projects more student-based allows for scholars to continue to learn, while also allowing students to enjoy time off.\n \n An important part of growing as a person and figuring out what career path to go down in the future is exploring possible interests. This break from the school year allows for students to do this outside of school, as well as time given to relax. If the length of the projects assigned over the summer are chosen by teachers, the students could end up with a big work load which takes away from their opportunities. Many students get jobs over the summer to gain work experience before furthering their education after high school. Not only does this help them build their transcript and resume before moving onto a new chapter in life, but it also allows them to figure out what they like do versus what they do not like to do. Students who are overwhelmed with summer projects are more inclined to not get a job or participate in the things they like to do, which defeats the purpose of the break.\n \n Another positive outcome of student-designed projects is students can have a say in what they want to research. If the students are allowed to pick the topic of their projects that have to do with the associated class, they are more likely to have better work and learn more. Again, this break is given to scholars to allow them to enjoy life outside of school. By giving students no say in the topic they are furthering their learning on, they are less inclined to do their best work or even any work at all. Having students pick the topic of their summer assignments would surely make the projects more enjoyable and easier for the students to complete.\n \n Finally, the last component that students should be able to determine for their summer projects is the platform they use to complete the project. Hands-on students prefer to do projects on a poster board, while more tech-savvy students would prefer to use Google slides or Prezi to present their work. Giving students a say in the way they are able to complete their project makes it a lot more enjoyable for them, essentially making it easier to complete. There are many different types of learners like people who prefer to visualize the topic they are learning about or people who would rather hear more on the topic. More visual learners may have better time comprehending the subject of the project if they can add visuals to the projects by hand. Audible learners may want to listen to videos regarding the topic and film a podcast discussing their work to better process the research they have done.\n \n Student-designed projects allow for better learning and understanding of the topic, while still allowing students to enjoy their time off from school. Although, student should have a say in the subject, length, and platform of their summer projects, teachers should also set boundaries for these projects. It would be pointless for students to study a topic not relating to the class at all. Teachers could provide students with a list of subjects to research that they can pick from. There should also be guidelines that pertain to the length of the project because it is unfair if some students work really hard on the summer projects, yet others slack off for the same grade. However, the students should have some say in the amount of work they chose to do. Students should also be given multiple platforms to choose from, but not completely free range. The risk with giving students a free range of platforms is students could use platforms that teachers are not familiar with. Students should be given the choice of the topic, length, and platform concerning their summer assignments with teacher guidelines. It is important to keep students learning, while also letting them participate in the things they are passionate about.",

That is what summer vacation is for, it allows people, especially students to have some quality time off. Students do not always do their homework, from personal experience that is true. That is why they have less chance of doing projects during the summer when they can be relaxing instead. If they are giving the option to select their own projects they desire, they will more likely finish the project and have fun while doing it.\n \n That allows students to stay interested in a certain topic they love to learn about. This makes projects during break way more fun, and it increases the chances of students doing the projects. From personal experience, learning about topics I am passionate about or interested in, makes it way more fun to research and learn about.\n \n People might disagree that students do not don't care about their projects, or that they won't do it, regardless what topic it is about. That is false, humans are curios creatures, learning is part of the everyday life for everyone. Learning is fun and it helps individuals develop as a person. Students are more likely to work on projects that is important to them, topics that they love learning about.\n \n Everyone enjoys time off, but there is times when everyone has to do work. During summer break, students have time for both. Summer projects will help keep their minds ready and assure they learn during break, while they also have time to relax. Students will increase their effort in projects if the topic is more interesting for them.\n \n They should have the choice to choose what projects they want to do on their summer break.",

      "Once a year Summer break comes around, the time of year every student is looking forwards too from the moment it end till the minute it begins. Yet some schools believe that their students need to continue to study, and learn over this long break. Summer is a time that has always been advertised as a time to go on vacation and put down all the books for a series of weeks to have fun. Yet for some students this isn't an option some teachers assign rigorous assignments for students to complete which can completely control and ruin theirÂ time off. By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is 2 and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.\n \n If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.",

      "One time in the 5th grade me and my classmates were given an assignment that we were told to design by ourselves. We were told to choose any format to present our projects and allowed to present it on any topic as long as it related to science. As the deadline for the project drew near many students talked about how they had not completed the project because they lacked direction. As a result many students received bad grades and teachers struggled to grade individual projects on the same scale due to varying formats and topics. Many schools are questioning whether summer assignments should be designed by students or teachers. Mandatory summer projects shouldÂ be designed by teachers to guarantee that students have a clear understanding of requirements and continue to learn over the break.\n \n Educators best understand the curriculum students need to keep up with. In the majority of schools different departments are run by teachers working together to design the courses. If summer projects are designed by the same teachers then schools can ensure that the assignments will help students prepare for upcoming classes.\n \n Additionally, these projects can give a general idea of how the class will be taught and how difficult the course will be. This way students can get a head start on the material and have a complete understanding of what will be required.\n \n When designing tasks teachers can ensure that students are given enough work to learn. Over the summer of my freshman year I was given a project where students were allowed to choose which book they read and write a report on it. Many students chose short novels and finished their assignments in only a day. This caused any potential learning to be lost as students mostly forgot about the assignment after completing it. Projects designed by teachers can ensure that students do enough work over their break to continue learning outside of school and that the work matches the level of the class.\n \n Teachers can give additional support and instruction on assignments they designed. When projects are created by students teachers may struggle to help them with questions they may have. In the English department at my school teachers all work together to design large projects so that anyone in the department can answer questions and help students. This leads to a better understanding among students but still allows them to create unique and individual products that promote growth.\n \n Projects assigned over long breaks should be designed by teachers because teachers can better understand the curriculum, ensure that students learn, and provide additional support on assignments. In the future more assignments could be created that allow students to get a glimpse at upcoming material. Long breaks that often cause students to lose touch with the rhythm of school can be turned into opportunities to prepare. We should all encourage the furthering of our education by demanding that schools around us help students learn over break and require teachers to design summer projects for students.Â  Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more 3 regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.\n \n To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more 3 and helpful for a student in the long run.\n \n Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more 3. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.\n \n Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more 3 regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may 3ly design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more 3 if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be 3ly prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also 3ly make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.\n \n As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more 3 than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more 3, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.",

      "Summer projects are often assigned to students to ensure learning continues over the summer. They help keep students' hands moving and gears turning. Projects are typically designed by teachers, however, when made by students the work load is easier to handle and is best fitted to each, individual student. Teachers can't always make classwork fun and engaging. By having a student make their own project, it takes the work load off the teacher and gives the student work they will enjoy doing. Additionally, most projects made by teachers have the same structure, therefore, it would be easier for students to cheat. Lack of supervision and a surplus of free time can lead to unwantedÂ collaborations.\n \n Everyone knows students dislike school, It has loud teachers and bone numbing A/C. Students are constantly falling asleep in class, not listening, and avoiding work. Being assigned a project over their sunny Summer break must be a bummer, right? That's what most people think, but assigning work that students have more liberty over can give them the upper-hand. They can choose a project that they have the supplies for, set it so it doesn't take much effort or time, and not to mention, they can be creative! They get an opportunity to explore something they're passionate about. And when a student is passionate about something, they make sure everyone knows.\n \n Projects take up time. In the Summer, time is in excess. Giving out a project makes sure they always have something to do. Students loose a lot over their break, they come back to school perplexed at a simple math problem. Take Generic_Name into example, she's an A-B student but every summer she looses what she learned that school year and it takes a few weeks for her to get back on track. Usually her first report card has C's and even D's. But one summer in 10th grade she was assigned two projects and her first report card in 11th grade had ALL A's! She was way ahead of the class and felt more confident when completing her assignments. Practice is key to gaining knowledge. With students tongue tied, Summer projects help turn their question marks into exclamation points!\n \n The teacher may also get a better understanding of his/her students. They get to see what they like, what inspires them, what makes them mad, what makes them said or what they have strong opinions on. It makes it easier to relate to a generation that seems illegible on the exterior. Kids can be confusing, especially with the professional relationship of teachers and students. They can't be as personal with their students, even then, there's too many to even try!\n \n Student-made projects give teachers an easy window into their individuality. Future projects may also improve and become better suited to the audience. Complaints about the complexity or disappointment of their assignment will disappear. And, yet again, the work load that is removed. No more stressing about what they should learn, just some simple guidelines and grading rubric. They could even make their own!\n \n Teachers put a lot of effort into their job, some would say the most out of any job. Their own money and heart is put into their work. They buy students supplies and are even are taught as if they were the teacher's own! There will always be that one kid that wants to show off and ends up biting off more than he can chew. Teachers give great structure by making it themselves. Projects are also easier to grade because they would all have the same structure. Summer projects can be a great way to keep minds growing over that long break, it just depends on the situation as to who should create the project.",

      "Almost everyone who attended school can attest to how boring and tedious summer work can be. Whether it's assigned reading or a project, students often dislike having schoolwork cut into their summertime. However, it is a necessary evil, and although there are compelling arguments for self-directed learning and independent study, the fact remains that it's the teacher's job to know how to help their students learn. Summer work should be designed via a partnership of students and teachers, so that students can learn in ways that interest them and help them grow, and teachers can ensure that the material is taught correctly.\n \n While the intervention of teachers in this process may seem to be too controlling or unnecessary, the fact remains that they have gone through a lengthy process to ensure that they are trained to teach the material as 3ly as possible. They go through an extensive process involving obtaining at least a bachelor's degree as an undergraduate student (and in many cases going even further and pursuing post-graduate studies), spending time as a student teacher, obtaining other certifications, and taking part in continuing teacher training throughout their careers. The experience and education that teachers have is simply too much to ignore when considering the development of a student's summer project or curriculum.\n \n Another factor to consider when advocating for students developing their own projects or curriculum is that all students are different. Some may not design their own work with their own best educational interests in mind, and others may not do as well learning via a highly structured summer project or curriculum. Yes, some students are very bright or passionate and will diligently undertake projects and studies on their own, but that is not true for all students. Everyone learns differently, and many people thrive in situations where they have specific guidelines and rules to follow or goals to meet. The wide range of learning and personality types in schools is a major reason why summer projects and curricula should be a collaborative effort between students and teachers. No two students learn the same, so why should they be forced to do the same work?\n \n Although there are many good reasons for students doing projects that were designed by a teacher, it is also important to consider the fact that teachers may simply be out of touch with how their students wish to learn. Student-designed work can be incredibly fulfilling upon completion; the student will have identified an area of study they enjoy, pursued and researched it, and hopefully will have reached a fulfilling conclusion through a project, experiment, or assignment. However, all of this can be accomplished to its fullest potential with the help of an adult. A trusted mentor (such as a teacher), can be an invaluable resource to a young person undertaking a major project on their own.\n \n Much of education deals with absolutes. Standardized testing, graduation requirements, etc., etc. One can go on and on describing all of the things that individuals must do to conform with the school system. All of this is necessary to ensure that all students find success. However, summer work is a wonderful opportunity for a student's individuality to shine through, and with the help of a teacher, they can design work that will be fulfilling and extremely educational.",

If the student creates their design it could be fun and easy for them, and they will be learning from it as well, and they will understand it more because they are make whatever out of it. They could do it in their own way which will also make them determine to complete their own design they created.\n \n Students design could also help the teachers too , they wouldn't have to do much planning cause the students have to come up with their own designs so the students have to come out with ideas on their own.

      "Work over the summer sounds boring enough, it creates less time to have fun over the summer break. However, what if it was the students to design the summer project, that can be based on a interest, a hobby, or an activity. In addition, if this was a possibility, creativity can shine on a student project, and a sense of pride upon working, so while doing work, student can enjoy of what they enjoy, share their ideas and passion. While others believe, that teacher should designed the summer projects; However, if the summer project was a student design, it'll benefits students and gives freedom to work on what they are interested.\n \n If were to be students designing a summer project for school, it brings out the creativity and how its unique from comparing other student's projects. Also, this summer project can spark a students passion or ideas to share, and create a voice for themselves. Moreover, student designed project, can cause less vulnerability of copying others projects, it creates a space where everyone is unique in their own way. I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.\n \n From the project, there was not a lot of commitmentÂ for sharing ideas. ProcrastinationÂ happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot ofÂ encouragementÂ to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.\n \n In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share.Â",

When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.\n \n Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do.

And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.\n \n Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it.Â",

      "Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.\n \n If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?\n \n When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student canÂ do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.\n \n Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.\n \n Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.",

Most of the time students will go see a parent, or go out of town, so they wonÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â´t even have time to do a project.\n \n My other reason is that teachers make projects to complicated.

Students in the summer would know what they have time to do and if they wanted to take more time to get something accomplished they dont have a due date to go by they have more time .\n \n Is a summer project was student designed I think it would have a greater outcome of student completion and student satisfactory. Students wouldnt be stressed or exhausted after they finish the project. They could used their strength and weaknesses to their advantage to get a good grade. The work wouldnt be assigned by some teacher who they had last year. The work would be assigned by a the students for the students.Â",

    essay:
      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects...should these projects be teacher-designed or student designed? Summer is a moment that shouldn't be taken away by work. As a student it;s best for summer break projects to be designed by students. Although some may disagree that student-designed projects are effective; with a student-designed project time management can develop, more relate-ableÂ projects and creativity can be produced, and principals of cooperation/social skills can be established.\n \n Firstly, time is just as potent as life itself. As an adult time management is key in the world of work. However, the younger generations of students, and children do not process this until later in life. The time difference in constructing, doing, and presenting a project can be comparable to real world activities such as: writing a report with a crunched due date, getting to a destination in a reasonable amount of time, utilizing and enhancing a persons' morning routine to get out the house more early, and many more real world tasks. Time is just as important as breathing everyday, and with having student-designed projects, students can gain these experiences at an early age; with replication, the success rate of younger adults will increase.\n \n Secondly, doing the same activities every year such as: large research papers, extensive PowerPoint, and book reports can be repetitive; especially during summer vacation when both students and teachers alike get a break from the constant working. Students designing projects can prove beneficial; however, not only to the students themselves but teachers and even the environment along side. The creative factor in a simple project can increase for example, a science study project that involves a class taking a trip to a zoo or animal shelter for studies. Giving the class a opportunity to decide on summer projects can also tie into the immersion of summer vacation. Instead of being that book report, a person can interview others who like or dislike the book and gain criticism, knowledge, and information from a vast prospective. Not only with creativity, having the ability to relate to the studentÂ can be a opportunity to increase overall contribution of students in projects over the summer.\n \n In addition, communication is important and a staple point in our economy. Allowing students to design summer projects can put the basic skills of cooperation and socialization to use. Understanding and accepting cooperation can place a person in a better position in life than someone who refuses to cooperate with others. And cooperation is needed life after high schoolÂ examples such as: getting assistance on business, buying objects such as houses and a vehicle, working along side coworkers you don't like. Along with aiding the understanding of cooperation student-designed projects can be helpful for those who have trouble with socializing, anxiety for example. Placing a person within a group of like mindedÂ people with goal in mind can give one the opportunity to get assistance with anxiety and communication blocks throughout life.\n \n It is often argued that having teachers to designate projects can be more beneficial than having students do the task. Certainly there are those who claim teachers are more experienced, well organized, and can provide more clarification on requirements for the task at hand. However, role reversal and having the students design the projects can result in more creative ideas, have individuality or unique portrayals of each separate idea, and a overall better interest in the project itself. As a result this side is more effective because you can gain more interactions within the targeted group, more interest in the assignment as a whole, and lower levels of stress weighing on a person or group.\n \n As we have seen the argument of whether students or teachers should be designated to design projects runs on; having students design projects can be more of an improvement than a teacher. Simultaneously a teacher can gain more interest and interaction in the overall class, and boost the basic core skills of time management and cooperation. Not only strengthening a persons' individual skills but a persons skills to interact with the world after high school.",

      "Students are like baby chickens. They need a leader and proper guidance to ensure they prosper in life. Teachers can be and usually are that mother hen for their students. This applies to many circumstances whether it is in school, during the summer, or even after college. Planning projects in the summer, a perfect time for students to grow and expand their knowledge, is an area that most teachers are experts on. Some people may say projects given during the summer should be designed by the students. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed because students cannot be held accountable and need guidance.\n \n Summer projects should not be student-designed because students are not trustworthy. The majority of students will search for an easy way out and try to make the project as simple as possible. This is completely divergent to a teacher's mindset. They enjoy pushing students out of their comfort zone so they have a better chance to improve and grow. Students cannot be held accountable to design a summer project that will challenge their mind because of their lack of motivation. In addition, students are not responsible enough to be bestowed with the task of creating their own project. Without a doubt, they will prioritize relaxation and fun over learning and hard work, especially in the summer. As a repercussion, it is a waste of time for the student and teacher, since the student did not put forth their best effort. Some people may say students should create their own summer projects so they can take the initiative and learn to be independent. However, they are wrong because students cannot be held accountable for their actions due to their lazy mentalities. Teachers benefit from challenging students, which is why teacher-designed summer projects ensure that students continue to learn.\n \n Another reason teachers should design summer projects is because most students still need assistance and guidance. Teachers are more experienced in life and share their wisdom with children. Nevertheless, they know what activities and projects stimulate the brain and help students learn better. With this additional knowledge, they are better suited to plan and organize projects. For many students, their brain continues to develop and their pre-frontal cortex develops last. As a result, they rely on their amygdala, which is why they do not have the best decisionÂ making skills. When asked to create a project, some students do not know where to start because they need guidelines to accomplish a task. For this reason, teachers are always there to help and give guidance. They look out for their students and give encouragement because they want what is best for them. Many people say that schools should give students permission to design summer projects as a way to give them more freedom and allow them to express their creativity. Although, they are incorrect because students still need guidance since they do not have as much experience compared to adults and for the reasont that their brains are still developing.\n \n Clearly, summer projects should be teacher-designed due to the lazy mentalities and ongoing brain development of students. Children cannot be trusted to create their own project because they will not challenge themselves enough, especially compared to a teacher. Students still require guidance because their brain is still developing and teachers provide beneficial wisdom. It is essential that these projects stimulate the brain so student continue to learn over summer. Without a doubt, teachers should definitely create summer projects because if they didn't, students might be robbed of a prosperous future.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure we continue learning during break. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? As a student, I strongly believe that the summer projects should be student-designed. Even though teachers will disagree, they're wrong! When a student gets to choose what he or she does for their project, I know that we'll have more fun completing it and we'll be given the chance to become more creative than what a teacher would make us do.\n \n Summer break is suppose to be fun. If a teacher gave us a project, we'd be sitting at home, all alone, inside reading about a great adventure, when we could be having our own! Instead of writing a boring paper, with no enthusiasm, about someone else experience, we could have the chance to go out and make our own. Then, the paper would be full of passion. I would rather design my own project that would not only make my teachers happy, but will let me have fun while completing it!\n \n Another great reason students should design their summer project, is because is gives us the chance to become creative. Creativity inspires us to thrive and do our best. For example, a few years ago I was told to come up with a way to show how bullying can change ones life. I had a great idea! I went around the school and asked ten people if they were ever bullied. If they said yes, I asked them how it changed their life, or if it even did. I wrote down everything they said, and decided to make a short play. The play was about a little girl who was bullied her entire life, and the things she stopped doing because of the bullies. The play showed everything the teacher wanted to know and more! I loved doing that project, and to this day I will never forget how proud I was and how much fun I had doing it! It gave me the chance to explore my creativity. I wish i could get the chance to do it again!\n \n I understand schools want us to continue to learn during our break, but that's why we should have fun while doing it! A student-designed project gives us the chance to have fun, make our own experiences and explore our creativity! When a student enjoys doing the project the outcome, or grade, will become a lot better. This is why I believe the student-designed projects would be better than any teacher-designed project. It gives us a chance to grow, not only as a student, but as a person too!",

      "I think Summer projects should be teacher designed rather than leaving the student to their own devices. For reasons like having an idea already set for the students, making it so the students don't get too lost, and if the teacher came up with the topic for the project then there's be more summer than work stuffs.\n \n Now then, when an idea is already laid out for someone, it becomes faster for then to think of more ideas from the base of the first example. For book reports and the like, its already hard because you have to choose from a list of books that you probably don't want to read,* but it gives you a bit of simpleness to get to choose a book that is meant to be read during summer.\n \n Now comes the topic of getting lost within your own thought as you try to think of an idea that wasn't preset for you already. Getting lost is inevitable in some cases, but when there's no prompt to start you off, it becomes a lot harder to follow up with good ideas.\n \n When it's the teacher or school that comes up with essay prompts, you'll have a much easier time since it saves up time from your summer. Book report prompts are usually made so that they're going to take a while before you finish them; but since those all have prompts already set by the school, they don't take as long as they would.\n \n The question that this prompt asks is vague as it is, but the fact that I wrote this much based off of that makes it seem less vague and more just difficult to interpret. Summer projects being teacher designed is what all students have gotten used to at this point in time; and it would be wrong to switch it up on the next generation of students to make them come up with their own ideas from nothing to base them off of.",

      "Many schools incorporate summer learning into their students' curriculum to have them maintain knowledge gained throughout the school year. Although these projects are thought to be beneficial for students, the topics and activities given by teachers are often strenuous, and frankly, uninteresting to students, especially during their summer break. Summer projects assigned to kids should be allowed to be student designed to fit the student's interests, keep the child engaged, and to promote responsibility when constructing a project.\n \n As a child grows, so do their interests and beliefs. Allowing student designed projects means letting them take control and organizing their own thoughts in which they see fit. By letting kids create a project based on their interests, it enables them to stay engaged on what they are working on, and to be able to put in their best effort and ideas into their assignment. A child's own ideas would mean better grades and a better concept of the topic they have chosen.\n \n Students must be taught responsibility, and by allowing them to create their own rubrics, guidelines, and ideas, it promotes creativity and a sense of control in a child's mind. By allowing this flexibility of guidelines and rules, kids can stretch their ideas further without having to feel they have gone off-topic because it will be designed by them.\n \n Although some might claim that teacher designed summer projects are more structured and educational for students, this is a flawed argument because most assignments given by teachers are strict and are only focused on a certain topic that not every student will take interest in. It's also important to give students a chance to be creative with their own guidelines and requirements, something that is restricted when a rubric designed to a teacher's expectations is given. Students would simply thrive more if handed an assignment they could create and build on their own.\n \n In conclusion, schools should begin leaning more towards student designed summer assignments because of the immense freedom that is given and the responsibility that is required of students to create their own projects. It is important that from a young age, kids are able to write, discuss, and learn more about topics they are passionate about, and it is even more important that we do not limit their creativity because of the idea that projects should be teacher designed.",

      "Over Summer break, certain students are required to complete projects to ensure that they're learning during their time off of school. Summer projects are quite beneficial to students; they allow students to become more knowledgeable about a subject during the process of completion. Although, a few factors should be considered when creating them. These types of projects should be designed by teachers since they're aware of the curriculum, it'll avoid students from making it too easy, and it could potentially benefit the students.\n \n When teaching, the teachers must teach according to the school's curriculum. They also have a complex understanding of the material that they share with their students. With this knowledge, they'll know what to include when designing the projects. Not only do these assignments encourage the students to learn, but some teachers assign these projects based on the new material they'll be learning when they come back. Therefore, they will be prepared for the new unit when it's introduced to them at school.\n \n A majority of students come to school prepared and eager to learn. The rest of those students are typically known to be lazy or carefree when it comes to schoolwork. If they get the opportunity to design a summer project, some of them might take a shortcut, which may defeat the purpose of the project. Without authority, numerous students obtain the idea to go after something they normally wouldn't go for if they had a sense of authority. Some will put in zero to no effort into designing the projects.\n \n The purpose of assigning these projects to students is to ensure that they keep learning. Certain students won't gain much knowledge if they're not given the right tools to learn. Another factor that comes into play is that kids sometimes feel pressured when a teacher expects them to fulfill something. Sometimes they need a sense of direction when they're clueless about what to do; lack of direction may sometimes lead to confusion.\n \n With these reasons in mind, teachers should design summer assignments for their students, instead of the other way around. Students will be ready to absorb more knowledge and will be able to understand the material in a deeper meaning. Overall, teachers know what's best for their students. If the projects are done in an organized manner, this may guarantee success into a student's school career.",

      "Summer and projects are two words that dont go well together especially for some students. Summer is a season to be enjoyed by many no one is in school and a lot of people are out on beaches or vacationing and having a good time. However, some teachers assign projects during summer and some hate it and most rarely do some enjoy it. Teachers assign projects so that students dont forget what they learned in school, but many argue should the project be teacher or student designed. Summer projects should be more student designed because they are more creative, they have more ideas and it makes them a better thinker.\n \n One reason projects should be student- designed is because they are more creative. Many projects that are offered in education systems are always one sided or the same. Many teens during school tend to do projects but they think its boring what the teacher assigned them. They need to be more creative. They could use different colors or different things to make it their own way.\n \n For example, a student in school had to do a project that she didnt want to do, so instead of doing what she was suppose to, she decide to think outside the box and do her own thing. The teacher got mad at the teen but the teen said It's better to be creative then do the same thing as the others. While some may say that being creative cant get you anywhere, those type of people would be wrong.\n \n Many famous celebrities and scientists got to where they are or were because they had to be creative to reach that high. Furthermore, being creative on school projects makes one different and unique and many teens today should do that.\n \n Another reason projects should be student- designed is because they have more ideas. With many projects assigned they are usually being given a specific thing they have to work on. Many teens, however, dont want to do just one thing they want to be expressive and show how many ideas they really have. During class a teacher assigned a project that any students disagreed on, and many told the teacher that they didn't want to do that. The teacher asked the students what they wanted to do and many of them responded with different ideas about how to do it and what they wanted to do it on. in the end, the teens came up with more ideas that even she couldn't think of and assigned them to do whatever they had brought up or though of. Some will argue that more ideas isnt always better, but that would not be correct.\n \n Many companies or businesses in today's society come come up with more and more ideas to keep their companies going, and to them the more ideas they have the better. Therefore, it is essential to having more ideas for summer projects is better because it gives you more think about, and is better than one specific idea.\n \n The third and final reason why summer projects would be student- designed is because it makes students a better thinker. In today's schools many teens are tired and sleepy. When adults or others assign them something like a project or anything thingÂ really, many complain that they are boring or dumb. When it comes to doing projects students have a hard time doing them. Mostly because they dont like what they are doing or because they simply dont want to do it.\n \n Students would be so much more ecstatic to do a project if they could just do the way they want to do it. During the summer a teen had to do a project on something she didnt really want to do,so they about day after day, night after night until it finally clicked into in their head. They were going to do a project that no one had yet to think of. After days of thinking and hours of working he had perfected his project. Since he had to think more about what he was going to do it took him longer but in the end it ll worked out for him.. Others may say that on test and presentations and even homework he wouldnt have to think as hard and the only reason he thought so hard was because they were working on a project but that would be false.\n \n You would still have to think hard on tests to know how to get the answer, on presentations you would have to think how to set it up and all. and for homework you would have to use your mind to answer the question. The project helped him think harder and because of that he was also able think better during his school performances. Projects may not always be the best but they can improve one's thinking ability.\n \n Many school or summer projects should be a student- designed because they are more creative, they have more ideas and it also makes them a better thinker. Students and even teachers have the ability to choose what they want to do and no one can stop them from doing it.\n \n Some students may be scared to choose their own path or their own way but depending on what they are doing it can all wok out for the better and can become a much better person for it. Sometimes choosing a way that everyone goes isnt always the right one or correct one. For example, like on a project many students may choose to do one thing, while oneself wants to do something in a completely different direction. By all means, do whatever is best for oneself, instead of what others want to do.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â",

      "Student-Designed Summer Projects\n \n Schools across the nation have chosen to require their students to complete summer projects during their break. This requirement is designed to assure that students continue learning while they are outside of school. Though many schools agree on this idea, there is another debate surrounding the issue. Some agree that the projects should be designed by students, but others feel that they should be outlined by the teachers themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed because this would allow students to display their creativity, their true knowledge and abilities, and their overall work ethic.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because this would allow them to showcase their creativity. They would be able to choose the format of their own project. This could be anything from posters to online presentations. In addition, allowing students to have creative freedom over their projects would increase their interest in the idea of summer work. If they could create their projects using any format, they would be able to incorporate their own ideas and interests. A student who is interested in graphic design could use the Internet to create their project. On the other hand, a student who is interested in art could draw their own poster by hand. Letting students creatively design their own projects would allow them to learn even more. They would be able to explore new project formats and find new resources that they could then implement with future assignments.\n \n Another reason these summer projects should be student-designed is because it would allow students to exhibit their true knowledge and abilities. Without an explicit outline of what the students must incorporate into the project, they would need to determine what all should be included. This would allow them to show off their knowledge of the content at hand. This would also show their ability to separate important content from unimportant details. Teachers would be able to use the knowledge of their students' strengths and weaknesses to design future lessons and projects that would fit their particular group of students.\n \n The final reason that students should design their own summer projects is because it shows their true work ethic. By designing the format for their entire project, students would be able to show a commitment to their education. Projects that are designed poorly and thrown together at the last minute would show that those students did not put in very much effort. On the other hand, projects that are neat and organized show that they were put together with effort and precision. These students would clearly have the stronger work ethic. Knowledge of their students' work ethic could be very valuable to teachers.\n \n Though many people agree that student-designed projects would be more beneficial for the students, others disagree with this opinion. Some people believe that summer projects should be created by teachers instead. They argue that projects organized completely by the teachers would allow educators to ensure that students include all of the necessary content in an organized manner. Though this could be viewed as a slight advantage for teachers, it is outweighed by the many disadvantages of this idea. By not allowing students to design their own projects, teachers would be limiting their students' creativity. Outlining the projects completely would prevent students from placing their own creative spins on the projects, so teachers would end up with nearly identical projects from all of their students. It would also place more stress on the teachers. By not allowing students to have the creative reigns over their assignments, teachers are placing more work on themselves. Though the idea of teacher-designed summer projects might seem better, the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages.\n \n Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it would allow them to show off their creativity, their personal knowledge and abilities, and their individual work ethics. They would be able to display their creativity through their choice of format for their project. By creating their own designs for their projects, each student would be able to show off their ability to translate their knowledge into an appropriate format. Finally, the effort put into designing their project by each student would show teachers whether or not they possess the ability to work diligently on their assignments. Though teacher-designed projects would allow the teachers to ensure all projects are completely organized, student-designed projects allow students to incorporate their creativity and interests into their project design. Overall, students should design their own summer projects because this opportunity would allow them to take charge of their own education.Â",

      "Imagine walking into a new school year, having already learned some of the topics your teachers will teach this year and still memorize some of the stuff from last year. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure students continue to learn over their summer break. Should students be able to design what they want their projects to be or should the teachers design it? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will pick educated projects for their students, it will be harder for the teachers to answer questions and grade individual projects that the students came up with their self, they will know for sure the projects taught students things for their upcoming year. Here is all the reasons why the teachers should design the summer break projects.\n \n First, students might pick uneducated projects to do. Teachers will pick projects that help relate to what they learned in the class room. For example, students might pick what they are interest in, instead of picking what they need to learn to better their learning experience over the summer. Teachers are more likely educated than students about what the students will learn in there next grade level. So for instances, they will give them projects based off what students will need to know next year, to further their education for the next grade there are entering in. For these reasons teachers should be the one's to choose the projects for summer.\n \n Second, it will be easier for the teachers to answer question and grade the projects. If a student gets stuck and need help from a teacher, they can email the teacher an ask for help. If it was student-designed each student might have an individual project. It will be harder for the teacher to answer all of the questions, because he or she did not pick the project for the student. If the teachers come together they can figure out the right projects that can benefit the students education. This is another example for why the teachers should design the students projects.\n \n Lastly, some students might say that, by letting them design their own projects. It will not be boring and it will increase the rates of students actually doing the different projects over the summer. It will also make students put more effort into their individual projects. However, if they let the students decide then how will they know if their learning anything from there projects. It will be way easier if the teacher choose it because then they will know for sureÂ they will learn something educational while doing the projects.\n \n In conclusion, they should make the projects over the break teacher-designed, because teachers can give out educational projects, the students can ask questions about the projects the teachers have choosing and it is more easier for the teachers to grade, and they know that the teachers will choose what is best for the students to help them get through the year. To make it easier for the teachers they can all agree on what educational fun projects they want the students to do over the summer.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "At a lot of schools summer projects are not given, but at some they are and they are given vigorously. If over the summer projects are given, they should be student-designed for many reasons. First off, letting a teacher decide what the students will do over summer will not only make the kids mad, it will also cause them to be less engaged with the topic and assignment. If the school allows the children to pick their topic, they will be more engaged because they are creating their own work from the bottom up. This will be more fun for the students and they will be more likely to complete the project. Summer projects should be student-designed to be fair to the kids, to make it more fun for the students, and to also further engage children with their work.\n \n The first reason to why summer projects should be student-designed is because that is the only way that it will be fair to the students. Kids will be able to choose what they want and start their own creation from scratch. Giving the students the same topic by the teacher will put some at a disadvantage. Some are not likely to complete the assignment because they do not want to do the topic assigned, and some will also not be comfortable with competing against their higher academically sound classmates. Another reason kids should be able to pick their own topics is because a lot of schools do not do summer projects in the first place. This is just to be fair to the class. Let them pick their own topics, do not add on to the kids' disengagement by telling them what they are going to do. It will also be easier for the kids to complete the assignment if they are able to choose it themselves. For example, this past semester, my history professor assigned my classmates and me a project about the history of the United States. Each student had the exact same topic and that made it very stressful. We all were trying to search the same things, and it sure made it harder to find the information when the teacher assigns a tough topic. Then on the other hand, this semester my professor has allowed each of us to pick our own topic. It has created a lot less stress and it is easier to find information on the topic when we are able to search it and find what we need. So, to be fair, let the students pick the topics of their choice and there will be a better outcome.\n \n The second reason of why the projects should be student designed is so that it will be fun for the kids. The students should be able to pick a fun topic of their choice, and not a rigorous topic that their professor assigns. This causes the students to be able to pick a more personal or relatable topic to them, that they then will want to complete. Letting children choose their topics will also assure that each project is different and that there is no way for them to cheat. When each student chooses their own topic, there will be color and diversity to each project. This will then make it easier to grade for the teachers. If each student had the same topic, it would be harder on the teacher to grade because they would be looking at the same thing for every student. It will be fun for them just like the students because they will be able to see what is going on in their students' minds, and how creative they can be. So, students should be able to pick their own summer project to make it more diverse and fun.\n \n The third topic adds on to the first two, and that is when the students are allowed to pick their own topic, they will be more engaged with their work.\n \n There will be more diversity and intensity among the work, A student will want to complete their work, because it actually means something and can be personal or emotional to them. Assigning the sudents a project based off of what the teacher wants is not smart. The professor should be able to come up with what the criteria requires, but let the students pick so they can be engaged. Students can also create some competition amongst themselves when they are able to choose their own topic. They will compete to see who can create the best work and see which one their teacher will like the most. Their minds will be able to explore and their work will represent how they feel and what the project meant to them.\n \n In conclusion, letting students pick the topic of their summer projects will have many benefits for the students and even the teachers. It will be more fun to the students and teachers. The students are able to let their minds explore and they are able to be engaged with the work that they have created. It will also be fun for the teachers because their grading will not be as tough and boring. With each student, they are able to see something new and what their students have thought of. There are no real disadvantages of this, as long as students stay in the guidelines of what they are supposed to do. And, that should be no problem if the students know exactly what to do. Summer projects are already enough of a hassle for the kids, so let them choose their own topics to be fair, fun, and create more engagement within the classroom.Â",

But, what we don't realizeÂ is that these summer projects can be very helpful in the future. Once we go back to school, and as we get older and closer to graduate we try taking difficult and more advanced classes to bump our gpa. To be in these classes, most of the time, teachers assign summer assignments to give the students an idea of how the class is going to be and the certain skills you need to maintain to be in that class. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed because the teachers already know what the standards are in that class, and what objectives you need to be familiar with before coming into that class. Also, if a student were to design the summer projects, they might make it easy for their fellow peers and not work at their full potential.\n \n I believe that teachers should design the summer projects because they know what can benefit you as a student and want to see you succeed as much as possible. One reason why I think teachers should design the summer projects is that the teachers already learned the subjects they are teaching. So, they could create a summer project that could help the students understand the material the teachers struggled with learning when they were once students. Another reason why I think the summer projects should be teacher designed, is because the teachers probably have taught the class before and know what topics you need to be familiar with when you arrive to that class. Also, the teachers have had experiencesÂ with students in the past and know what skills and work ethic you need to succeed in that class. In my opinion I think that students required to complete the summer projects would be better off if it were designed by a teacher.\n \n If the summer projects were designed by the students I feel like the students wouldn't make it as challenging as the teachers would. I feel like the students wouldn't work to their full potential since they know the teacher didn't design the project. As a student, I think that sometimes we try to find an easy way out to complete an assignment and I think that the students would make the project not as challenging and in the future that could affect how we would do in the class and the easy project would reflect on our grade if we dont know the full material. Also I think that the students might not know the criteria as well as the teachers do, to assign a project on it.\n \n Overall, I think that the teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects because they have the experience and the students could ask them questions if they need to involving the project. The students would defiantly benefit from the teachers designing the project because it would give them an idea on how the class would be like in the next school year and would prepare them to strive in their classes. On the other hand, if the students were to design the summer projects they wouldn't know what topics to include, unlike the teachers that have had experiences with other kids completing their assignments in the past. In conclusion, I think that the students would be better off if the projects were teacher-designed.Â",

    essay:
      "It is a common occurrence for teachers to assign work over the summer. There are many reasons for this, the most prominent being to keep students refreshed and ready for school and new classes after a long break. Many argue that the responsibility for the creation of these assignments should belong to the students, while others argue that the teachers should have the control in these assignments. The ones who should be responsible for the creation of these assignments is the teachers for a multitude of reasons, the main ones being that teachers have a better understanding of the next years content, they understand the skill level of the class as a whole much better than the students, and students can and will get lazy with assignment creation intending to slack off.\n \n The purpose of school is for students to learn new things and gain a more advanced thinking process, the point of the summer assignments is to prepare students for the new things they will be learning. The implications of this are that, if students made these assignments, they would not be able to prepare themselves for the next year and for what they don't know about. On the other hand teachers have gone to specialized college classes to teach their respective subjects and have a much deeper understanding of what it is they have to teach. These qualities allow them to best determine what a student must know and remember for the next year, because a student who doesn't know physics can't properly prepare themselves for a physics class. Vice verse a teacher who has a degree in physics knows exactly what they want their students to know and remember when they enter their class.\n \n Another reason in favor of having teachers create the summer assignments is the fact that they know their classes better than any singular student does. This ties in with how students don't know what is coming the next year in the way that the teacher has the most knowledge on what the class as a whole struggles on the most and therefore, can form assignments around this. While a group of friends can have knowledge on what each otherÂ struggles with they don't know about the rest of the class in the way teachers do. A teacher has access to all tests, quizzes, and basic assignments from their class, this information is not privy to the students and therefore a student can never truly understand what is needed in these assignments.\n \n The final reason for summer assignment creation to be put in the hands of the student is the common laziness and apathy that many students face. One simple sounding solution to the problem above would be to have each individual student make their own assignment with a check done by the teacher. The problem with this is if an individual student is given the choice to make their own assignments many will choose something much easier than necessary and not get the proper education benefits from the assignment. Then, if everything about the assignment must be checked by the teacher anyways it only gives the illusion of choice. In actuality while the students may have different assignments from each otherÂ it is no different from the teacher just giving the students a more specialized assignment seeing as the teacher will make the changes to it they need anyways. Since this is not giving the students the true ability to make their own assignments the power is now in the teacher's hands. Therefore, if students are given true control of their assignments, they will always look for an easy way to increase their grade with the least effort, this is why teachers are given responsibility over the students. If responsibility was removed students wouldn't learn in school and assignments would almost never benefit the students.\n \n In conclusion while there can be an argument for students creating assignments, if the choice must be black or white, the teachers should have the responsibility of creating summer assignments. The reasons being that teachers have more knowledge of a given subject and a deeper understanding of students, while the prevalence of apathy in students harms their case. While in actuality the best choice would be one of compromise in which both students and teachers get choice, the teachers should always have the majority of choice in the assigning of almost all work pertaining to school not just summer assignments, or else there is no purpose of school in the first place.Â",

    essay:
      "For most students, summer is a time of freedom and relaxation; unless, of course, they're given a teacher-designed summer project. As a young learner, I can tell you truthfully that being assigned a summer project is absolutely heart-wrenching. Imagine enjoying your amazing summer and you realize half way through it that you have a summer project due; and if you're anything like me, you'll still find yourself procrastinating on it as the thick assignment haunts you over your shoulder with every fun summer adventure you experience. Don't get me wrong, summer projects can be extremely helpful; however, the stress that comes with them can be avoided if the assignments were student-designed. That way, the work can be personalized to improve the learners' problem areas and fit into their summer plans.\n \n Students know what they struggled with while school was in session; they were in those classrooms learning it and trying to understand it the best they could all year. Therefore, they have the ability and information to design a summer project that allows them to learn and improve in whatever topic they had trouble with by putting it together in sections. Perhaps their problem areas were small parts of units. For example: \"unit 4, 2.1a\". If that's the case, they could include that portion in the assignment to help them practice. If that's not the case and they simply just didn't understand an entire unit, they could sum up the lesson and include those factors as well. This allows them to learn and practice so they can be the best student they possibly could during break.\n \n As I said before, summer is a time of freedom and relaxation; however, us youngÂ onesÂ have to keep learning or else we'd lose our scholar touch. So, the student-designed summer project could be broken up by months; this is an acceptable way to help learners keep track of their summer work becauseÂ not only does it allow them to set aside free time for their break, it also helps them make a reserved time for assignments. That way, kids can still enjoy their break while keeping those learning juices flowing. This working format mayÂ even help uplift stress because when students see a big project that's nothing but work and no sections, they start to feel under pressure and might even begin to procrastinate. This event has happened to me countless of times; I see the task, get overwhelmed, and procrastinate. Although I am guilty of being a bit of a bad student because of this, I know good and well that sectioning work into months is a much better way to handle the load.\n \n Opponents may claim that because they don't want to work over summer, the young learners will make it ridiculously easy for themselves so they can have a relaxing break. This is a valid point, however, us students just want to improve ourselves. It can be embarrassing to lack understandingÂ of what's going on in the classroom; it can also make students feel like failures, or even feel stupid. I know from personal experience that school leaves majority of the kids feeling like the most idiotic person alive; but that just motivates them to do more to improve so they won't think down on themselves. That is where the student-designing comes into play; if they made it too easy for themselves, they wouldn't be improving. If they're not improving, the continuous cycle of feeling like an idiot will not end.\n \n In conclusion, students know what is needed for them to thrive in their academics and they're willing to have open arms to allow that to happen. With the assignments being by students, for students, they are designed specifically to help them achieve the hardships of assignments and to come back to school with their brains running, in school mode, and ready to learn.Â",

      "Some schools have these dreadful summer projects that students don't really enjoy to do. However, it's required in most schools, regardless if it's a reading assignment or a history assignment. The school system just wants us to keep our brains going during the break. Now here comes the big question of the day, should the projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? When this was first brought to my attention I would have said student-designed .Now that I have put further thought into it . I feel that it should be teacher-designed and student based. What I mean by that is students should have a big role in how teachers design it, so that students would be eager to do them ,and have a good challenge on their hands. Nevertheless it should be fun and educational.\n \n Students count down until summer break and not just in ''\n \n Highschool Musical''\n \n either they can't wait to hangout with their friends, be out all night, and not have to wake up for school. Students know it's always that boring assignment that they have to complete over summer , which they wait the last minute to do. If the assignment was student based which mean it would have been appealing to to them, then they wouldn't wait all summer to do. It wouldn't just be a bunch of confused, nonintrested students putting anything down on a piece of paper just so they can get a grade. Some people might not agree and say an assignment is an assignmentÂ it has to get done regardless. However I myself am a student and I know once students get an assignment that they are eager to do your probably going to get their best work yet.\n \n Everyone loves a good challenge especially a student. I know I do, and so does my peers. Students love an interesting challenge that will have them using their brains. The whole purpose of the summer project is to assure that students learn over the summer. What a better way to do it then by finding out what interest the students and challenge them to lean more about it , rather its for History class or English ,or in the format of a poster board project or an essay project. An educational challenge is always a good challenge because 1 it teaches students not to give up 2 that there is always more to learn.\n \n I understand that theres going to be an assignment due at the beginning of each school year. However, if it is teacher-designed and student based schools will have an outstanding out come because the more the students are eager to learn , the challenges get harder, and the harder it gets .The more students learn how to succeed in life after high schoolÂ probably before they reach high school or the 12th grade for that matter. Summer projects are for the students to learn more an as long as it is teacher designed and student based the school system will have a greaterÂ impact on our lives.",

      "If there's one thing all students can agree on, it's that summer is the best time of the year. We can also agree that having to complete work assigned over the summer is the worst. Instead of staying home and doing a math worksheet for hours, most students would rather be lying on a beach. Summer gives kids the chance to get a break from the stress that comes with school and having to spend free time doing assignments they don't enjoy. Some schools have started implementing projects assigned to students for them to complete over summer break. These can either be teacher-designed or student-designed, which creates controversy. I believe that schools that require summer projects should be student-designed in order to build creative skills, allow students to explore their interests, and experience more responsibility.\n \n A lot of students often feel stuck when it comes to working on school projects with specific guidelines and topics. Instead, these summer projects would let kids be creative in what they'd like to complete it on. It's very important for students to learn how to be creative, which many jobs need in the future. In the past, some of my favorite projects I've done were the ones where I got to have total control on what it was on. It allowed me to use my creativity for something different and helped me strengthen those skills. Students need to learn how to use their creativity to create a project to better prepare themselves for skills needed in different fields of work. Letting students explore their creativity also helps them enjoy completing these summer projects more. I feel that whenever I'm assigned something over the summer, I dread doing it and then end up finishing it at the last minute. If I had more control over a project assigned to me over the summer, I would have a much easier time completing it. Kids don't like to be constantly restricted, so letting them have creative control over a school project would result in better work. By giving students creative freedom over summer projects, they're able to strengthen their creativity and make a better project overall.\n \n For most students, we don't usually get to choose which classes interest us the most until middle school. Student-designed summer projects allows us to explore things we're more interested in than what we learn in school. I've found myself feeling trapped in a class that I absolutely hate, which makes it much harder for me to do well in that class. When I get to use what I'm interested in to create something like a project, it's a lot easier for me to feel motivated to do so. In middle school, we had to make PSA projects for a couple different classes, which allowed us to choose a topic we like. I chose to do one of mine of adopting dogs instead of buying dogs, and I ended up getting an A on it since it was something I was really interested in researching and informing others of. Students want to learn more about topics that aren't taught in school and these student-led projects will let them do just that. Teachers can expected to receive much better work on projects that students are actually interested in, rather than a boring or confusing topic. This can also help student discover new things that they enjoy that they would've never found out about if they hadn't be assigned the project. New discoveries are beneficially to students who struggle with what they enjoy while trying to think about their future. Students enjoy getting to explain some of the things they find interesting in the form of projects.\n \n Many students are faced with responsibility everyday, but if they have to create their own unique project, they get to experience responsibility that isn't always available to them. Students can learn how to be responsible by experiencing it from something they enjoy. A project that they can design is the perfect opportunity to explore responsibility. Doing those PSA projects was helpful for me because I dealt with the responsibility of completing the project better than I had before. I felt that coming up with my PSA wasn't a chore, but rather something I actually enjoyed. These projects can help teach students that responsibility isn't always something that has to be dreaded or feared. Responsibility can help build character and maturity. Student-designed projects allow students to learn that responsibility can be enjoyable too.\n \n The introduction of summer projects in schools should be student-designed so students can be more creative, learn about new things, and learn how to be responsible. Many could argue that letting students create their own projects gives them false hope that most projects will be the same, but they also let kids experience individualism. Teachers would still have to put some restrictions in order to keep them appropriate and give a standard set of guidelines on what the materials should include. Letting students design their own summer projects helps them grow as they get older to help them for their futures. Many teachers should consider assigning fun projects instead of worksheets over the summer in order to get the best results from students.Â",

    essay:
      "Most students do not like homework over the summer, so it can be difficult to get students to do the work. Many schools just give students a generalized project to keep their brains working. If you got students involved in the choice of their homework, they would be more likely to really work their brains on it. Schools that require projects over the summer should be student designedÂ because it will increase enthusiasm and expand variety, students will go into more detail, and cheating will be decreased.\n \n First, if schools made summer projects student designed, it would increase enthusiasm and expand the variety from the students. For example, Generic_Name who loves outer space is more likely to put effort and research into a project about space than he or she would about the water cycle. Each student has their own interests, and the best way to reach the minds of all students is to let them design their own project. The originality of the students should not be diminished by putting their creative ideas in a box because we want a generalized subject. Teachers also don't want to read the same report over and over 30 times. Student designed projects would allow the grading process to be more interesting for teachers. In the event a student discovered something very interesting, you could actually do something with it.\n \n Also, student designed projects would improve the likelihood of students going into more detail. Students want the opportunity to expand their knowledge in topics that interest them. Why not let them teach themselves and you something along the way? Students doing a project on something that doesn't interest them would be a vague and boring version of something that could be chosen by the student. In the science fair people aren't given a topic, they are told to run free with all the ideas they can think of. That's how a summer project should be.\n \n Finally, student designed projects would decrease the level of cheating. Student designed projects wouldn't allow for the same cheating as teacher designed projects because the ideas would have to come originally from the researcher. You might think student design versus teacher design has nothing to do with cheating, but there are many reasons as to why this is a component. Say you are a big vacationer and choose not to do your project until the end of the summer, you might just call up a friend and ask them to share their ideas with you. With teacher designed projects, that is very easily done. If you chose your project and did all the research on it, you would be less likely to give up all the information to a lazier student.\n \n Schools should have student designed summer projects because enthusiasm and variety increase, there will be more details on the projects, and cheating is less likely to happen. Students want to have fun over their summer with as little stress as possible. Giving students the chance to design their own projects would not only get their brains working but would allow the research to be fun. Turning a task into an exciting opportunity for learning is what would happen if projects were student designed.Â Â",

      "At some schools summer projects are a requirement for students to complete during the break. These projects are assigned for students to continue learning over the summer break. Not only do these projects help students learn new content, but it helps the students retain the information they have learned prior to the break. These breaks are fairly lengthy and without some work between each school year it is often difficult to retain the information that the students have learned. Many of these projects are teacher-designed, and the thought of student-designed projects are a possibility. Student-designed projects may sound great to students, but this would ultimately be ineffective when it comes to student progression. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would be more organized, more effective, and more efficient.\n \n Although some may say that student-designed projects would lead to less stress, teacher-designed projects take away the stress of creating the project. Students will have to think and create a project for themselves to do over the summer with student-designed projects. This adds another step for the students to go through in order to complete their work. Some students are not as creative as others, and they might struggle to think of an idea for their project. Some students may stress over if what they completed is acceptable and adequate. Students would not have to stress over the creation of their projects if they were just given guidelines to follow by their teachers. Teachers distress the projects by taking away tasks that the students would need to complete to finish their assignments. Students having to create their projects adds a whole level of stress to the project that would not be there if the teachers had designed the projects for the students.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would be more organized than student-designed projects. Teachers can create organized projects with many details to the project due to them already doing that during the school year. Teachers create projects and assignments throughoutÂ the school year, so they are good at creating guidelines and rubrics on which they are scored upon. Teachers are able to organized the fine details of the project such as what it is on, what it should be formatted like, and what it will graded on. Teachers can organize assignments better than students because it is their jobs to do so in order for students to learn. Teachers are the best suited in order to make projects organized.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would be more effective than student designed projects. The projects created by teachers are based on material that the students have learned or will learn in the future. Students should not know the material that they will learn in the future, so the teachers creating the material for the students would be effective for them to learn. The teachers know the content the students will learn, so making the students create the assignments would be absurd. Teachers know how to create projects that will help students understand the material because they know how students learn. Giving students the task of creating a project will be based on prior knowledge and not what they will learn: this is just memory retention rather than learning.\n \n Teacher-designed projects would be more efficient than student-designed. Students creating a project for themselves to do will take up more time than if the teacher were to assign an project for the majority of students. This takes away the time from the students' vacations and time to create the project. The teachers would make the experience much less time consuming for both the students and the teacher. The students would spend less time designing the project, and the teachers would spend less time going through each project idea. Teachers would efficiently grading through the projects due to them being based on the same assignment.\n \n Teachers would be the best option to design projects for the students to do over summer break. Teachers would create a less stressful project overall for the students because they would have to spend less time on creating an idea for the project. The teachers are better at organizing big assignments and projects such as a summer project. Teachers know the material that students will learn making teacher-designed projects more effective for student learning. Teachers will create a time effective and efficient projects not only to complete, but to grade as well. Teacher-designed projects are more beneficial to the student for learning over the break than student-designed projects and should be the preferred method of project design for all schools that require summer projects.",

      "As the weather becomes warmer at the end of June, students eagerly leave their schools excited for the start of summer. However, in most school districts, summer break doesn't mean a break from school work. Many school districts require students to complete an assignment over the summer to assure they continue learning . Over the three month break, students must complete one project. This project should be about a topic of their choosing. Allowing students to complete a project on an area of their interest, rather than a topic assigned by the teacher, the work will be of higher quality, have a stronger impact on students learning, and be more enjoyable for both the teacher and students involved.\n \n When students complete a project on what interests them the most, the quality of their work is dramatically increased. The students are willing to do more research on a topic they enjoy than a topic assigned to them. Someone who spends time playing music outside of school will be more interested in discovering the impact of music on their community, than researching the rain patterns in the state of Florida. Over time, the work each individual puts into their project will be more meaningful and have a stronger impact on their learning. A student may go out to a museum related to their topic, or interview a neighbor that is specialized in a specific area. The knowledge gained from students completing their project is important, but each student will learn new skills beneficial to their unique life in the future. When school rolls back around again in August, each student will have a more enjoyable time sharing to their classmates and teachers about the topic they spent time lots of time learning more about over the break.\n \n Some people may argue that all students should complete the same exact teacher-designed project over the summer. While doing so may make it easier for teachers to grade by simply using a rubric and checking off all areas complete and marking off areas not included. However, when the school year begins, most people involved won't be interested. Classmates listening to the project will not be focused on the student presenting, since they also completed the same project, and the teachers grading will quickly get bored from hearing the same thing over and over again. The entire objective of having an assignment for students to complete over the summer, is to ensure they are still learning. If students aren't interested in the topic they are working on, the impact of the project and knowledge acquired will not be as great. The impact will be much greater if students are completing a project on something they enjoy.\n \n Allowing students to have a more enjoyable summer that is still filled with learning is important. Students that are required to complete a project over the summer should be researchingÂ about a topic they enjoy, rather than one assigned by a teacher. When students complete work that is important to them, the final product will be of much higher quality, have a stronger impact on the students learning and future, and be more enjoyable for the teacher and all students involved.

      "BOO! BOO! Cried the Generic_SchoolÂ students when they found out they have to complete a summer project over break in order to assure they do not forget all of the material they have learned over the school year. However, what these students do not know is that they are not the only students that have to complete this project. Various schools have adopted this strategy and there has been a debate about whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Letting students design their summer projects could be an extravagant opportunity because students would have an opportunity to be creative, however, teachers should be in charge of the summer projects because teachers have more knowledge on their subject than the students, more experience with lesson planning, and can also construct projects that can be fun and enjoyable for students.\n \n To start off, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more knowledge about their subject than students. For example, by the end of the school year many students have already forgot most of what they have learned over the past school year. On the other hand, teachers teach their subject material over and over again for years at a time. Teachers know their subject like the back of their hands, where as, students are just learning this material and still have much more to learn. Another reason would be that students often have a hard time remembering the material they learned at the beginning of the school year because students have work upon work piled onto them with every class that they take. Once the students learn one unit teachers move onto a different unit and eventually by the end of the year students have so much information crammed into their brains that they can have a hard time keeping up. This is why teachers should take it upon themselves to plan the summer projects for students.\n \n Additionally, teachers have more experience with lesson planning. The job of a teacher is to come up with different lesson plans and strategies for their students to assure they obtain all the information they need. Students are not educated on how to teach other students. Students may be able to come up with a summer project but between the students and the teachers the teachers would have a better project idea because that is their job to have effective projects. Teachers know what strategies work for helping students obtain knowledge. It would be irresponsible to allow students to come up with their own project. Any typical student would not be thrilled about the idea of having a summer project so if students were given the opportunity to construct their own assignment then they would make it to where they would not have to do as much work. However, teachers would guarantee that their project plan would work for their students.\n \n Furthermore, teachers have the ability to construct projects that are fun and enjoyable for students. Although there may be a selective group of teachers who typically would not have hands on and enjoyable projects, majority of teachers could construct a fun summer project for students. Whether the project is to visit a certain historical figure and take notes or to raise awareness for any person in need. Some teachers who are experienced and have worked with students for years at a time are aware of what students are capable of. If a student is motivated enough and has the right resources then they can achieve any project assigned to them. Teachers would also have to keep in mind that every students is different and has different resources and limits.\n \n To conclude, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers are more knowledgeable than students about their subject, they have effective lesson planning strategies for students, and have the ability to make any project enjoyable for students. There is nothing wrong with assigning students summer projects to make sure that students remember all the material of the past year. Students forgetting material over a set amount of time is not uncommon. As long as these summer projects are fun and not stressful on students then the students will remember their summer for years to come.Â",

    essay:
      "Summer is a great time of year for both teachers and students. Months of break and leisure allow for a good cool downÂ after a long school year. However, summer isn't all fun and games, as many schools give out summer assignments in order to keep the students learning over break. But should the responsibility of designing these projects fall on the student or the teacher? I believe that teachers should create and design these projects, as students could make the assignment too easy or too hard, warp the directions to a point where the final product is no longer what the teacher is looking for, or just not complete it.\n \n My first reason justifyingÂ my belief is that students could make the assignment too easy or too hard. If given the choice between taking on a difficult assignment and an easy one, most students would choose the easy one. In this same way, if students are given the opportunity to make their own assignment, then they will do everything in their power to make sure it's as simple and easy as possible. This results in them not actually learning anything and defeats the whole purpose of the assignment in the first place. On the other side of the spectrum, there could be students who try to take on too much with their project, setting lofty goals and overcomplicatingÂ the assignment. This only serves to build stress the student over break as then they feel as if their project is too much to complete and only do a minimal amount of work on it, if any at all. If a teacher were to give set directions, then this wouldn't happen as there would be a very minimal amount of freedom, resulting in projects being neither too easy or too difficult.\n \n Furthermore, if a student is given the reigns on the creation of an assignment, they could warp the directions, intentionally or accidentally, and the project could end up becoming something the teacher isnt looking for. This could happen for many reasons, ranging from students with malcontentÂ looking to make it easier for themselves or students who just understood the directions differently than the teacher explained them, resulting in a project that doesn't teach the student what they need to learn. If this occurs, the student would not realize their mistake until they go back to school in the fall and turn in their assignment for a grade, leaving them with a bad grade to start off the year and no chance for remediation.\n \n However, the opportunity to create and design the assignment could help students find motivation and may even affect the quality of the work. It's no secret that people do better work when they are invested in the topic or field, and often times go out of their way to avoid topics they hate. Because of this, if students are given the freedom to create their own project, they are more likely to center it around something they are passionate about, leading them to be more likely to not only complete the assignment over break but actually put effort into it.\n \n Contrary to the previous point, students, if left to their own devices, could end up just not doing the assignment. This could happen because the vague guidelines given by the teacher to design an an assignment could be unclear and seem overwhelming to even begin. Non-creative students could also not to start the project as they can't think of a place to start, leaving them to be more likely to not try. Even if the student does get over the initial barrier of creating an assignment, they could get bored wit their topic and change it several times, resulting lack of motivation to actually finish or a final product that is half baked or an amalgamation of several ideas.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects need to be created and designed by teachers in order to prevent students from making and assignment too easy or too hard, warping the directions, or not doing the assignment at all. All of these only result in the students getting nothing out of their summer assignments, leaving precious break time wasted.",

      "Summers can be the best times of a students life. They get a break from the stress and anxiety of school and they are allowed to do any and all things they wish to do within the legal limits. Summer projects are designed to keep students engaged and learning. This can be a very good thing as long as the project is based on a topic that the student actually enjoys and will be motivated to complete. Students struggle staying engaged enough during the school year, adding a project during the time they are meant to go be kids should be handled very carefully. If they want the projects to be successful they must set a broad topic and allow the students to chose anything they want under that umbrella topic. Students will enjoy doing a project about a certain YouTube creator they have fun watching, a sports team they love, or even their favorite book they read during school or over summer break. These projects should not be based around a Shakespeare play that they struggle to even read let alone comprehend. Summer projects are a good idea as long as they are handled well.\n \n Assigning a project to a kid during the two and a half month break they get is something that needs to be handled very carefully. Learning is very important and having the project is a good idea. The students must be able to choose exactly what they want to do. This will keep them interested in the project which will make all the grades of the projects go up compared to if it was a topic they have no interest in. The students will use more of their time to perfect the project instead of waiting until the last weekend and just turning it in because they do not care about the topic and do not want to waste their time on something that has no impact on their future as soon as they finish the next test they have on the topic. Allowing the students to pick and choose their topic will help them learn about their team, person, idea, etc. without making them feel the stress and anxiety of a teacher assigned school project.\n \n Projects picked by a student may even result in more knowledge being gained than a teacher assigned project. Students could focus on a sports team and how they network their team to different audiences in different ways. For example, mascots are normally focused on the younger audience. Teams almost always have a promotion for the first certain number of people that arrive. The first one thousand people to go through the security gates get a free t-shirt or the first fifty fans to arrive get a jersey. Marketing and understanding how to focus products to a certain group of people is so important. My dream school, Virginia Tech, has promotions every basketball game that if the opposing team misses two free throws in a row the entire crowd gets a voucher for free bacon. This encourages all Hokie fans to be as loud as possible to mess with the mental mindset of the opposing teams shooter. A majority of jobs and careers that are pursued must have a way of marketing or selling their product so this is a very important skill for kids to have that they would not other wise be able to understand if they had to read a Shakespeare book followed by a five pager paper.\n \n Having a teacher assigned project does have an upside. This will give the students structure and something to base their project on instead of having all the options in the world and not being able to choose one. In school, students are normally more prepared if it is a topic they have been learning about and have background knowledge on compared to a project half way through a topic, or even towards the beginning. If students are given a short book or even a PowerPoint on the topic at hand they will be more successful in completing their project.\n \n A student lead project during the summer is a great thing it keeps the mind or a student engaged with out boring them. Students can research any and all topics they would like so that they enjoy keeping their brain working and focused on bettering themselves. Teacher based projects will give the students structure but will leave them feeling not engagedÂ because the topic is not something they will necessarily enjoy. The idea of a student based project is a good idea and should be created to help the minds and bodies of the students.Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Although in theory a student-designed project sound good, in practice the students will most likely struggle to make the project because of lack of understanding the project. This is why a teacher-designed project would be beneficial because it would be more thought out, leave a clear outline of what to do in the project and have more structure then say a student designed project.\n \n When you're a teenager you want to be free as possible but sometimes you are too free, that you don't know what to do with this much freedom so you do nothing.\n \n In this sense the project that would be designed by a student most student would have no idea where to start discouraging them for even commencing the project and of course there will be people that can do the project easily but we want to make the project fair and equal for everybody.\n \n This is why a teacher-designed project would be best because it would leave a outline of what the project is about, What you will create, how you will do it and what criteria you have to meet to have your project pass leaving it fair and equal for everybody or another solution to this problem is that it could be the students choice if he/she want to design the project or take the teacher-design project\n \n In conclusion a teacher-designed project would be the best option for this summer project because it would let the teacher outline certain thing they want in the project to ensure that the students are still learning over the summer break.",

      "Over the summer students tend to forget a vast amount of valuable information they learn during their education. To fix that issue most schools assign summer projects to students every year. These projects assure that students retain the information they learned in school and possibly learn more over the long three month break. In most cases, these projects are teacher-designed and students have no part in the creation of them. Some students may want to design the summer project; however, it should stay as the teachers responsibility. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge and teachers know how to creating projects.\n \n To begin, summer projects should be created by teachers because of how much information they know. In order to teach students, it is common knowledge that an educator has to know more than the learners. The summer project is meant to not only help students retain information, but also to learn more, and teachers are easily capable of adding that needed information. If there is a greater amount of information on the project, then students will be able to remember what they have learned. An example of such a project would be The Summer Reading Project because of how much material is sprawled into it. The Summer Reading Project is when students read a book over the summer and are required to fill out a paper with details of the book. This project reminds students of what they learned in English class and also helps students learn more by reading new books. This well thought out project is teacher-designed; therefore, teachers are more capable of creating summer projects than students because they have more knowledge. Either way, teachers having been learning how to teach most of their life should know best on how to create summer projects.\n \n To elaborate, teachers should design summer projects because they know how to create projects better than any student. Teachers learn how to teach and create projects for their students before they can even start educating them. This means that most teachers have experience with creating projects already and that making a summer project would be an easy task. Students have no background in creating projects because they are always the ones who complete them. Therefore, students creating their own projects would most likely end up as a disaster. A scenario like this would be chaos because students rely on teachers to give them the information required to learn, and they can not get that material if they are the ones creating the project. Teachers know how to make projects, so they should be in charge of the construction of summer projects.\n \n On the other hand, some people do believe student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial. This is because it could teach a student how to be responsible or learn on their own. However, many students today are extreme procrastinators and because of that their work would likely be average or below average. Teacher-designed projects are better because there would be a system that students can use to understand information better. If students were in charge it would become a jumbled messy puzzle of a project.\n \n To end, summer projects are better off being created by teachers because teachers are more knowledgeable and know how to create projects better than any student. Teacher-designed summer projects are extremely beneficial for students. New information learned from these projects provided by teachers can help students be prepared for what comes the next year. It is important to have a system in projects and the best people to create that system in the summer projects are teachers.",

      "The student-designed projects will create an educational and more engaging summer program than teacher-designed projects. Summer projects that are student designed will allow the students to create an engaging project that they will want and be able to complete over the summer break. By allowing students to design the summer project, students will want to complete the lessons they have created and will be able to follow the lessons at their own pace, with teacher assistance if they get stuck or have trouble completing the project.\n \n With the ability to create a structured summer project students will be engaged in the project and it will allow them to express their own creativity while designing the project. While creating the projects the students should be given a rough outline of the themes and main points that should be covered in the project, this will allow the students to complete a projects that will follow along with the lessons that teachers will present during the school year. Book projects that are student-designed and assigned over break would be interesting and engaging for students who may or may not find the actual book interesting, this would encourage the students to complete the project before the school year starts and be less stressful for the students. This process would lessen student stress about summer school work and would prepare the students for their classes in the new school year.\n \n The projects that the students create would also allow the students to follow along at their own pace throughout the summer without having to worry about family vacations or other activities because they would already understand the project and know what is required and how to complete it. This would also encourage the students to complete the project because it would be something they created themselves. The student projects that are created could have check-ins every few weeks to remind students of the project and ensure that they are gradually completing the assignment. This would allow the teachers some control over the programs without undermining the student-designed aspect of the project.\n \n A drawback to the student-designed aspect of these summer projects would be the concern about the educational value of the projects that are student design. The students could create a project that does not incorporate analysis or thinking skills that are necessary for their course during the school year. These concerns would be solved with teacher guidelines for the the project with certain requirements that would use the analysis and thinking skills, without taking away from the aspect of the student creation. This would allow the students to create an educational program that is interesting to students and meets all the required thinking and analysis skills.\n \n By allowing students to create their own projects the school system is continuing the students education over the summer break while still enabling students the freedom to do the school work at their own pace and have engaging projects for the students to complete. This program will increase the student learning throughout the summer and prepare them for the upcoming classes in the next school year.Â",

    essay:
      "Everytime students hear the word school they all have a similar reaction: \"why school.\" This reaction is due to the rigor of work school puts on students' backs and the repetition of constant learning. In order to give students time away, they are given three months of summer break which spans from June - August. During this time many kids choose not to continue learning and a negative effect of this is knowledge and memory decay. In order for their minds to be stimulized and conditioned to learn once school begins, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. The summer projects should be designed specifically by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them and express their ideas without being limited by a teacher, on the other hand teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them. Being able to do something which one is passionate about results in the best work that he/she can produce, this is because learning is driven by motivation. When a teacher assigns something for the student to do, he/she does not have an eagerness to learn because of the fact that it is something they don't have a strong passion for. When students are given an opportunity to produce their own projects, their minds open up and they begin to think outside of the box, which results in true creativity. School is based on a set curriculum and students have no input on what they learn and how they learn it, as a result, students lack effort and motivation to learn. Giving students an opportunity to create will eventually lead to increased productivity in later life One example of this is when adulthood hits and students are required to develop a skill set. Students are never given the opportunity to learn individually and this causes students to become dependent on others to feed them knowledge and information, therefore, students will only learn when they are demanded to. Having the freedom to create will give students their best opportunity to learn, whereas when they are not able to design certain projects, their goal shifts from learning to completing which will result in the content not actually being analyzed and took in.\n \n Not only does students designing their own projects give them a opportunity to pursue their interest, but it also gives them ability to express their ideas in a fashion which they are not pressured and limited by others. Students become boxed in boundaries due to the pressure of doing things a certain way and learning the way teachers tell them to. When students can design projects and learn in a way they believe is beneficial, learning becomes less of pressured task and more of a way to explore one's horizon. One thing students struggle with the most when completing assignments and projects is constant pressure. Students do not have the ability to express their ideas because they have to stick to an exact rubric. One of example of this is a science expo; many teachers tell the students what they should do for the project and don't give the students time to think about what interests them. This pressure of another voice constantly in their head makes learning and expression of ideas a struggle. In order for students to reach their full potential, they should be able to design in a way they are not boxed by others.\n \n In contrast to student-designed projects, teacher designed projects also have a positive impact on students because of their ability to create content which is consistent with the content students learn during the school year. Thinking outside the box and being able to express ideas is very important, however, without teachers, students would have no path of what to learn and how to learn it because they do not have the experience and accumulated knowledge many teachers have. Teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to the students ability to learn during the summer because the content would be structured in way which is taught during the school year. An example of this is when a science teacher assigns a cell packet project which corresponds to the cell unit taught during school. This might be very boring for a student to learn, but doing this project will set the student up for success when school begins. If the student were to design their own project it would probably not be in line with the certain style of teaching which will cause the student to struggle during the school year. The main focus of teachers is to help students succeed in school and by designing these projects students will be able on the correct path to fulfilling that goal.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to learn in a way which interests them and express their ideas without limitations and pressure by a teacher, on the other hand, teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. Being able to acquire knowledge and learn in way which interests one self is very important throughout his/her life, however there are different goals for both the student and a teacher. The teacher's goal is to help the student succeed in a certain class, whereas the students goal is to learn what they want in a way which interests them. Having the right balance is very important and this balance can be obtained by students designing their own projects in the summer and teachers guiding students during the school year. This method will result in individuality development and the teachers can lead the students on the right path throughout the school year.Â",

      "Every year from 6th grade to 12th grade year students have to do a summer project and turn it in to their teachers in their next upcoming school year. Due to al the mixed feelings about the project there's been a debate about whether it should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers will ensure the student will learn and grow and they'll set the proper criterias for it.\n \n Teachers know what students need to learn and usually what they will be learning in their next school year. With this knowledge teachers can determine how the projects should be structured to help benifit the students and make them grow. For example a summer reading project, a project made by a teacher where the students have to choose a book that's on the reading level that they should be at and do a report on it. The way this project is structured helps students learn and grow by keeping them reading making them grow stronger in it which can help them in the future with work,writing,etc.\n \n If somebody wants to learn something they need certain criterias to help them actually learn. A person can't learn something from something they already learned and know. The same thing can be applied to summer projects a student can't learn something new from something easy and that they already know. They need certain criterias, restrictions, rules on stuff to ensure they will learn. Teachers can ensure that the students will grow and continue on learning by putting the correct criterias. For example the summer reading project again where students have to choose a book in their reading level and do a report. If the teacher didn't put the rule of choosing a book in their reading level a student could have chose a very easy book and not really learn anything from it because it's not challenging for the student and something too easy to learn from. Therefor having teachers designing the projects ensures they will put the right rules down to make sure the students is learning. Not all students will do something like that but having a teacher makes it easier and more trusting to know they will keep learning over the summer.\n \n Some people think students should design it because it would be a lot more funner for them, get them more engaged, and make them a lot more enthusiastic about it when given the chance to design it. It's good to have the students enthusiastic and engaged but it's not ensured whether they will learn something or not. The chance of a student designing a project that won't help them learn much is not beneficial and defeats the purpose of the summer projects. It's a teachers's job to make sure that students are learning so they will do their job and make sure they are. It's better to know for sure the students will learn with the teachers designing it rather than to not be sure with the students designing it.\n \n Teachers are way more educated that students are. So they can make the best projects that can benefit the students the most compared to the students designing it. They know what to do, what to look for, and what's best for school. They are more trained,equiped, and have more knowledge to do it. So teachers should be designing summer projects not students.",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during there break. I think that they should be student-designed because if the schools want the students to do work on there summer break then it should be something they want to learn.

Also If the students design the projects they will have more fun doing them because its something they chose.\n \n I think that if students design there own summer projects they are something they want to do and not what the teachers want them to do. For example if a teacher designs the project then It would be like another day of school and i dont think the students want to do school during there summer break. They would prefer relaxing and not having to do work for 3 months. Also if the students design it then it will be something they like to do. For example having games or something similar to help them learn. Also if its something the students designed and wanted to do It would be more likely to get done and It wouldntÂ be a waste of time.\n \n Another example why students should assign there own summer projects is that it would be more fun.

    essay:
      "During the summer for most people its the time to go have fun , go out in the sun , go on vacation, work , babysit, or do whatever you want to do .In multiple societies for one-hundred eighty days students attend school and usually most high school students end up working or participating in some kind of sport during this time period . Due to this time lineÂ being so hectic with the pressure of studying and commitments within and outside of school its best that students now have this time during the summer to just be kids, be creative , be themselves , learn themselves, and take advantage of this break to the fullest extent. Because some schools require students to complete a summer project the assignment should be student-designed so they can be creative in their own individual ways and reflect growth over time.\n \n Even though teachers are use to giving students direct instructions on their work , it is fundamental to the development of the child to learn individuality. Giving students the choice to express themselves through the work they turn into their teachers at the end of the summer will show you who that person is through their behavior. For example, one day i came into class and my teacher had been telling us for weeks that we were going to have a project to do with no guidlines ... to just be creative and express ourselves into whatever form. She said it doesnt matter what it is it just has to be presentable. I could not figure it out for the life of me what i was going to do, i panicked because it was for my english class my best subject. Then i realized one of the largest issues we deal with as a whole in society today is individuality , who are we. So many people struggle with individuality especially in school systems because everything isÂ mimicked or put in place to follow a direct pathway that is made for students to be like someone else. Which is why that very simple question \"who am i\" ate at me for days until i sat down and really thought about it and i ended up writting a poem . I hadnt realized how much i use to enjoy writting them until i started thinking about something that really stimulated my mind and asked me a question i could contemplate. In the end i got an A in all areas of the summative but the grade didnt matter to me. I learned something that meant something to me that'll carry on into my adulthood. It mattered that one of my favorite english teachers taught me to be creative and unlocked different passions within myself just by giving me an assignment with no guidelines teaching me to teach myself personal growth. Giving students a chance to express themselves in their own ways teach them that its okay to be themselves , its ok to not be perfect , its okay to not know things because your still learning which is one of the best things you can do as a tecaher .\n \n After learning individuality it is important to reflect upon the growth , this will help teachers understand the students as a person overtime. Although if this assignment were teacher-designed the summer poject could just be another way for students to just feel trapped , overwhelmed, or irritated because they feel as if their teacher is giving them pointless busy work during a time their supposed to be having fun. Its better to give them work that means something , work that teachers can study , so they can feel like as a teacher your just as invested in them as they have to be into you. There was a very obvious difference between my english teachers assignments and my science teachers assignments , one of them stimulated my mind with questions about the world that my teacher left up to me to express and talk about and the other left me bored and uninterested and asking for help on bookwork . One of my teachers invested in learning about me for who i am as a person so she could teach me to the best of her capability and the other could care less for who i was as a person. My grades also became a representation of that ; Its understandable that duing the school year theres not alot of time to get to know 100+ students but over the summer dont make students do work for no reason , make it meaningful and make it worth something .\n \n In conclusion because some schools require students to complete a summer project the assignment should be student-designed so they can be creative in their own individual ways and reflect growth over time. School is a large part of the development of all people , it is how you learn and who your taught by for hours at a time . Over the summer these projects give students a way to get rewarded by grades comming back into school by showing who they are as a person. School systems should influence students more by showing that they're invested in them and not just on the grades they make in classes but who they are as a person teaching more than just book smarts but life experiences that they can bring into their adulthood.",

      "Have you ever had a summer assignment that was challenging, an assignment that you were not sure if you could complete?\n \n I most certainly have, in the summer leading up to AP World history, I was assigned a packet to complete with a due date of two weeks into the school year.\n \n Many people weren't able to start that project until close to the due date due to the confusion and misinformation surrounding the project.\n \n Since so many people were misinformed, many had to work a lot of hours to catch up.\n \n Some people weren't able to access the resources needed to do the assignment, so they couldn't even do it if they wanted to.\n \n That is why summer assignments should be designed by the students, so this can all be avoided.\n \n If summer assignments were student designed then the students would be able to design the assignments around their own limitations and time constraints in the summer, the students would know if it were something that all are capable of, and they would know if they would be able to do the assignment without teacher assistance.\n \n Some people might say that the assignments should be teacher designed because the teachers know the content the best.\n \n While it is true that the teachers know the content the best, they might not really know if it is something the students are capable of yet.\n \n The teacher creating the summer assignment might not know how much the student has learned in the previous year so there is a chance that the summer assignment is too difficult for some.\n \n Many times summer assignments are both made to review previous content and introduce new content the students will need when coming back to school.\n \n Students can be left behind if the teacher made assignment is too difficult for the students.\n \n Students know the constraints and limitations of their summer the best, so they would know how to design the summer assignment around this.\n \n Sometimes a project is too big or the student does not have the necessary resources to do the project.\n \n If students don't have the correct resources or the right amount of time then they can't do the project.\n \n Some students may be traveling to somewhere without internet so if the project assigned requires an internet connection then the student without internet cannot do the project.\n \n If the project is more toward the creative side of things then maybe the student doesn't have the resources to make it look pretty and nice.\n \n Students know if they are capable of doing the project.\n \n They know what they learned the previous year and if they can do the summer assignment using that knowledge from that previous year.\n \n They know if they can access the correct resources they need in order to do the assignment.\n \n When my history assignment was given to me some people unfortunately lost the packet needed to do the assignment.\n \n They couldn't get a new packet until they were back in school with very little time left to do the project.\n \n Having the students design the project with situations like these in mind would greatly improve the number of people who turned in the assignments on time.\n \n Students know if they are able to do it without the assistance of a teacher or another knowledgeable person to help them.\n \n If a student needs to ask a teacher a question the student can't during the summer and will have to wait for the new school year to start back up again.\n \n Sure they might have some form of old notes to help or clarify things but many kids either lose those notes or forget about them so those kids wouldn't be able to use that as a form of help.\n \n The new assignment needs to build off of students knowledge in a meaningful and attainable way, that all students will be able to understand.\n \n Students should be able to complete assignments given to them for the summer.\n \n Sometimes teacher designed assignments can be over expectingÂ of the students.\n \n The student designed assignments would be designed with limitations, capability of the students, and previous knowledge of the students in mind guaranteeing that every student will be able to complete the assignment within the given time frame and get a great grade on it too.",

      "Students should design the projects that they have to do over summer break not the teachers. If they are designed by the students than they are more likely to make the projects high quality.Â All school year the teachers create and assign the work so the students should get a chance to create there own work to give the teachers a break. This would be a great oppurtunity for students to learn about something that they are specifically interested in. Students should be the ones designing there summer projects.\n \n When people have an input on what is happening that gives them a bigger sense of excitment for the task. If a person is excited for something than they are going to want to do well on whatever it is. In order to create someÂ excitment for a summer project the students should get to use there creativity to design there very own. There is no reason a teacher would want a student to perform poorly on any assignment. By allowing the students to use there creativity to design there own project is a great way to optimize success on these summer projects.\n \n All school year the teachers are the ones who decide what the assignments will be and how they are going to be done. The students then have to conform to the teachers requests and do the assignments how the teacher expects them to be done. Now the students are going into summer break and have to do more school work. They should get a say in what is being done because they really havent gotten that oppurtunity during the school year. This would also be a great way for teachers to get new ideas for future assignmentsÂ as well.

Due to them getting to put there effort into potentaly learning more about something not specifically addressed in school before. This could help some students in the future when deciding what there major will be while attending college.\n \n Allowing students to design there own summer projects will create good oppurtunities for both students and teachers. Students will be more likely to do well on a project they got to design. Teachers would get a break from having to come up with an assignment. This will create a great oppurtinity for students to expand there knowledge on something that they are truly interested in. If there is going to be a summer project having them be student designed is a fantastic idea.",

      "Summer projects should beÂ design by teachers and not students\n \n Summer of 2016,the teacher assigned a project to read 5 books over the summer break. As a 6th grader the project seemed impossible to accomplish,but, by the end of the summer,the project was completed. 5 books read and a poster summarizing each book. Through out that same year and the following,reading played an important role in my life. Even though sometimes teachers design projects that may be challenging for a student,teachers know what is best for the students;students may not always know what is best for their learning.\n \n A summer project designed by the students has to be chosen before the end of the school year. The problem is that not all students have the same interests,or the materials needed for various projects. Some students might want to do research,not knowing that others may not have access to internet,a computer or the library. When students design their own projects,they are mostly thinking on a way that will benefit them to get the project done and not thinking about what other students will need. This could affect the students that may not get the project finished do to lack of resources.\n \n If a summer project is designed by the students, they might design a project easy enough to finish in the first 2 weeks,so that they can enjoy the rest of the summer. Students might design a project that does not go in depth. they could also design a project that will not necessarily have to do with what was learn over the school year, moreover,students will not challenge themselves to learn when building their own project. A project that does not challenge the students will never help them learn. The purpose of a summer project is so that students learn over the break.\n \n During the school year,teachers design the projects for the students. Teachers know their students,they know what each is capable of and what areas they need to work on. When a teacher designs a project,the project is chosen carefully. The projects designed by teachers will always challenge students to achieve beyond students expectations to reach their best potential. Teachers will never assign a project that is not in the students abilities.\n \n The student's learning is always in the teachers mind when assigning a project.\n \n In conclusion,some schools require students to complete a summer project that should be design by the teacher. When students design projects,the project will not always be in all the students abilities. Teachers design projects so that every student is capable to work on the project and finish it. During summer brake,students do not want to think about school;therefore,the projects designed by the students might not challenge them and help them learn over the break. Teachers know what is best for the students and they should design the summer projects,so that students can learn and grow even when out of the school.",

    essay:
      "should students or should teachers design their summer homework? I had a really hard time chosing between these two since i can see why having kids design their own homework could be a bad thing but it could also be a good thing. I had it the same way about having teachers createing the homework, is it really the best choice? i don't know. I ended up, after thinking a lot about it, to think that kids would be the best option to create their summer homework.\n \n These kids are expected to some time over the next 6 weeks to choose boring homework over their frinds, goodweather, pooltime, and other fun activities. What do you think that would end up in? them doing a little bit everyday or them doing it all a couple days before school starts and ruin the whole point of it? I think the later, but how do you change that? if they were part of designing the homework they would be able to make it more fun for themself and their friends and therefore be more motivated to do it more often than the last couple days of their summerbreak. If you want kids to do it more often than once every two weeks they need to be self-diciplined which creating the homework can teach them. They would have to be diciplined enough to not just choose the easiest way out but the most productive way out. Having them try and create homework for their summerbreak may start a chain reaction and make them more diciplined in doing their homework for the rest of the year since they got to experience the work and effort that is put into making their homework.\n \n Some kids need their \" aha so that is why I'm learning this subject \" experience, which is pretty important because it helps them reply a subject to the real world which help them learn future things in that subject easier. I belive that having them help design their summer projects would help with that. I know personally that I never had it that way in woodwork, art, music or fysics/chemistry and I do belive I could have been so much better at it if I have my aha experience. I had that experience with english pretty quickly and look at me now a foreign exchange student writting a english sol. Another experience they need is the \" this is actuallt pretty fun/interesting \" experince. This experience is when you find yourself fasinated or having fun with school because you like what you are learning about. I had it that way with social studies and history which is the only reason I have a 108/100 in my history class this quater. Having them design the project would mean that they have the power to make it fun which gives them the power to make the class fun so they can have good grades and interesting conventations about what they are learning. These experiences could also help them figure out what they want to do when they get older, which is pretty important.\n \n Despite seeing all these reasons why kids should make their own homework, I can also see why they shouldn't. I could easily imagine that a kid would take the level down so they wouldn't learn anything from it since they only know what they know and not what they don't know. I don't belive that kids and teachers ever is going to come to an agreement over the amount of homework. I also could imagine that a child would take the lowest work amount possible, which in my eyes don't sound like the purpose if summer projects. Where is their brain in this? having a fun summerbreak with their friends and family or keeping up with their learning? I don't think many children think far enough to keep up with their education when it comes to summerbreak.\n \n in conclution I have decided that a student designed project would be the best way to go around summer projects/homework. I think that students should be able to choose what their project should be about, but I don't think they should have control on amount or level. I do belive that the benefits of having them design the projects overweights the the negative consequences of it. I also think that them learning how to be responsible and desiplined enough to make the project and actually getting them done could have massive benefits for them in the future. So why should teachers design summer projects when the student created ones have so many more benefit and is more effective?",

      "I think the summer projects should be student designed. If its student designed theres endless amounts of things to do with the projects. Students will have fun with these projects and they'll have fun creating them. Here is why it think it should be student designed.\n \n Students have a wide sense of imagination and giving them an opportunity to do something like this is a great way of showing it. These projects give teachers the chance to see students be creative while still learning how to do things. Students love doing projects it gives them the chance to be interactive and it helps them make new friends. Projects lets students and teachers try something new. Students will have a lotÂ of fun making these projects and so will teachers. Every opportunity Students and teachers get to do a project they have fun, so why not let students try to make their own projects to see if its something that can happen every now and then.\n \n These projects will give teachers the opportunityÂ to see how much the students have learned over the course of the school year. For example, lets say the projects is on the renaissance students get to show what they learned during that portion of the year. Students will make a the work fun and maybe even the teachers will have fun with the projects too. Projects are already a lot of fun but students making their own projects will be a great thing for students and teachers. Teachers and students will get a chance to socialize and learn something new. Teachers won't let students show their creativity.\n \n To summarize, I think that the projects should be student made. It gives a chance for growth and development for the students. Students will have a huge opportunityÂ to show what they've learnedÂ during the school year. Seeing students do this really does show how much they've developed the past school year. So therefore it should be student made and not teacher made because some teachers aren't fun.",

    essay:
      "Projects, a word that some people enjoy and others despise. Over the summer some students are required to do a project to help them learn over their break. However, most of the time the teacher is the one to design the project, but I believe that it is best for the student to design the project. If the student is allowed to design the project they will have some interest in their chosen topic, be able to show their creativity, and will feel less pressured when presenting their work.\n \n When doing a school project it can be really boring, but that is because it is mostly a topic that your teacher chose for you, which will probably be based on what you are currently learning. If the student could choose what they wanted to learn about then they would want to do it more. For example, a teacher asks you to write an essay on a story you just read but didn't enjoy then you will feel like you just want to do the minimum amount of work and not put effort into it, but if it was a story you wanted to talk about then you would go into more detail when writing because you would likely want to share it with other people. Another example is when choosing a class, if your parents wanted you to take art and you didn't like to draw, then you would either fail, not try, or just hate the class. However, if you choose to do art then you will want to work harder in that class because it is something you enjoy doing.\n \n Coming up with ideas can be a difficult task for some, but telling students to create a project will help make them become more of a creative thinker. If you gave someone a problem they will try to come up with solutions to fix it, and this will help a them show some creativity to come up with a solution. An example would be if you told students there is a problem with a nearby lake and ask them to think of ways to fix it. It will make the students think about what could cause the problem and ways to fix it.\n \n Teachers giving the same topic to lots of students can case some to feel more pressure then if it was their own project. The reason is if everyone needs to present the same thing, if someone makes a mistake or lies about something then everyone will know. Even if a person doesn't know about the mistake there will be someone who does and may call the presenter out on it. However, if every student is presenting a different topic then they will teach people about something they might not have known before.\n \n There are still some that believe that the teacher should design the project. These people may argue that this will help a student stay on topic and ensure that a student will do something challenging to them. While that may be true, some people might not like the topic chosen and will either not do it or find a way to make it easier to do. Another argument is that some students might just choose a topic that someone else is doing and will copy all the work. If a teacher gives everyone the same project as each otherÂ then people could copy off on one another much easier, since its all about the same thing.\n \n Students should be the ones designing their summer projects. This will give them a chance to tell others about their interests, help students develop more creative problem solving skills, and will make students more comfortable sharing about their topic.",

    essay:
      "I think that all people could agree that school is important. Learning is important. It is how humans grow and change through our lives. New things are learned every day, especially while in school. In school, we sit down for about seven hours a day to learn material provided and explained by teachers, for nine out of twelve months of each year. Summer projects, if assigned by a school, should be designed by the student, and not the teacher, in order for students to deepen interests and research topics that may not be provided in a school setting.\n \n While schools continue to grow and change, and add new electives based off of future careers that interest many students, they can not have electives that will interest every student in the school. Electives such as tech ed, cooking courses, and cyber security are offered in my school, which help those students who would like to explore those career areas in the future, can only teach a limited amount of material and provide interests to only a limited number of students. A summer project created and designed by a student would have a completely unlimited amount of subjects that they could explore. Students would be able to create a project based off of something that they are truly interested in, or may already be good at.\n \n By the time most students are getting ready to graduate high school, apply to colleges or pick their major for the the first time, they have no clue what to do because high school didn't provide them with the opportunity to explore many interests. It is a major flaw in the way that the education system works, especially in the United States, because we are taught the important subjects; such as math, which can be applied in many careers, science which is required for all medical careers and many more, history which is important to know, so that it doesn't repeat itself, and english, which once you get up to a certain point, only applies to a very limited number of professions. It would not help students to do yet another project based off of a subject they have years to sit in a classroom and learn about. Students should be able to explore what interests them, outside of those mandated subjects. A summer project where a student has freedom to learn what they desire to learn about could look like, a girl who wants to explore architecture and builds a small structure, or a boy who wants to be firefighter and decides to volunteer at his local fire station, which he might not have time for during the school year. It could also be a way for a student that has no clue in the world what they want to do, to learn about a carer so different from anything they have learned in school.\n \n Summer is designed to be a break for students, I believe that most students would find it much less frustrating and more willing to do their best with a project, if they could do anything with it they wanted to. A project designed by the student would require much more imagination than a project with a rubric and instructions already provided by a teacher. Students would create something with passion and they would have desire more desire to learn if they could choose what it would be about.\n \n Some may argue that a project with stricter learning guidelines and design guidelines created by a teacher would be more benefit that a project created by the student, but it is evident that students learn the way teachers would like us to learn for our entire school year. We learn our lessons the from the teacher and we take the tests created by the teacher who wrote our lessons. A project based off of a student's imagination would be very different from what a typical project designed by a teacher would look like, but it would be very different in the best way.",

      "Every student has expierienced that one teacher who tries to give homework over break. Most Students look forward to summer break due to the fact that they have waited all year to be let out of school and have fun. With those statements put out there some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. They want students to continue learning over the summer. Schools should allow students to decide what projects they have to do over the summer. Reasons for this include students have to complete these assignments so they should design them, these assignments should be something they enjoy, they know what they need practice on. Therefore, this paper will elaborate on why this is the correct way to go.\n \n Students should be able to pick their assignments because they are the ones that are going to have to complete it. Yes, the teachers may assist the students in the proccess, but the student will be the one to complete the project ,and is expected for them to learn from it. Summer time for every student is supposed to be fun instead of being filled with work and stress. Yes, it is good for students to learn but, a break is for the student to relax because they have spent their entire school year working hard. A student should not have to spend their summer break doing school work because schools want them to learn more when school is done for the year. some might argue that only the teachers know what is best for the student becuase they teach them. However, if teachers were to decide what the students should complete the students may not try complete the assignments. Therefore, this may cause the students to not learn anything at all, and they will slowly become unmotivated.\n \n Another important thing to remember is the students should be able to do something they enjoy. It should not feel like school all over again, these projects should allow them feel like they are still on a summer break. Meaning students should not be overloaded with work and they should be given enough time to complete it. keeping in mind that they may have other summer plans. Especially not to where the student feels like giving up and feel to tired to continue on with their learning goals. Some educators will bring up the fact that everything that is good is not always fun but, they should want students to enjoy the things they do. This will allow students to still be able to enjoy their vacation, and be able to relax. Students should not feel like they are being forced to learn therefore, teachers of all grade levels would agree that students learn better when they are having fun. These assignments can be made fun by making the projects group related, or the students being able to win cool prizes.\n \n Lastly, the students know what they need help on the most, every individual student has diffrent learning abilities. Ever student has subjects that they struggle with and subjects that they are successful in. Therefore, the students should each be able to pick their own individual projects that will help them in the long run. If schools are suggesting that students still learn even after the year is over then, it is best that the teachers assist the students in what they pick but, they should let the students decide on their own. However many individuals would disagree and say the teacher knows best becauase she teaches the students but, this doesnt mean much because only that individual knows what they truly stuggle with and want to learn. Students should be able to choose whatever subject they desire as long as they can learn something from it. The schools should want their students to strive and be successful in every way possible even if that means they have to take their own path.\n \n Overall, students should be able to take their own route when it comes to knowing whats best for them. Students should be considered more when it comes to learning. Students should be able to make their learning expierience fun, students know what they need help with, and students are the ones that have to complete these assignments. No student is the same, every individual has diffrent needs and some schools fail to understand that. There are always lots of ways to tackle issues when it comes to learning. It can be a good expierience for everyone if every individual is taken into consideration. The main goal is for every student to learn something over the summer, this can be achieved as long as students remain as the main priority.",

      "Though I do not like summer projects, as I feel summer is a time to relax, if we are going to be assigned summer projects, they should be designed by students, not teachers. Most teachers do not understand us kids just want to have fun during the summer and not have to worry about some project worth 20% of our first nine weeks grade. It causes uneccesary stress during what should be a stress-free break and a student-designed project would reduce that stress.\n \n Something designed by a student is most likely going to be fun, like taking some pictures or making a little movie, not reading a boring book no one has heard of and then answering questions about it. No one wants to do anything like that during their breaks. A fun project is also more likely to be done. It is common sense that people are more willing to do something if it is entertaing and not tedious. Especially students.\n \n Furthermore, it is going to be many desgrees less stressful. If something is designed by a student, it will be made in a way that is not stressful at all. Most students do not want that added weight and responsibilty during summer break. As I stated before, many of us have jobs, and we do not need that extra stress.\n \n However, a teachers project would actually be educational and will most likely be designed to keep you on your toes. We tend to forget things we learned last year over the summer, so it is a good thing teachers give us work; even if we do not want it. But it is called break for a reason. But if we get work, might as well be fun.\n \n So in conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed. It is less stressful, more enjoyable, and it would take much less time from our break. Though teacher-designed would be more enriching, we can worry about learning subjects and remembering them during school, and not our break.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "To test students on their knowledge, teachers have begun to assign projects rather than traditional tests. There has been a debate on if these projects should be designed by teachers or by students. I believe these summer projects need to be teacher- designed. The teachers have much more experience at designing projects, the students may assign themselves an easier project, and the teachers get payed tax revenue for the sole purpose of teaching children and designing projects.\n \n The first major reason these projects should be teacher- designed is that teachers have experience in creating projects. Most teachers have gone through many years of education to get where they are today. They have gained skills and insight that most students do not have. Because teachers have this experience and knowledge, they know how they can force their students to display what they know. A project is meant to be a creative display of the collective information students have learned. Because students have not been prepared in education, they do not have the skills to properly design a project for other students. Some people may argue that when teachers let students design their own projects, they are teaching them important skills such as problem solving. Although their problem solving skills may be tested, they are still more likely to design a less efficient project due to their lack of education preparation.\n \n Where as a student lacks this education preparation, a teacher has spent years gathering it. Teachers can use their knowledge to create the perfect project for the class.\n \n Another reason projects should be designed by teachers is that the students may try to design an easier project so they can complete it quicker. As a student myself, I know that many students will try to get out of work if they can. Every school has issues with students not completing their assignments. When given the power to chose their work load, students most often pick an easier assignment. When most teachers assign a project, they do not want it to be a quick and easy task for the students. A project is meant to challenge the student. Students typically try to avoid such challenges. Students, like all humans on earth, are flawed. From my own high school experience, I know that I would design my project to give me the best chance of receiving an excellent grade. If students are forced to design projects, projects will become less efficient in displaying what a student understands. Teachers are more willing to challenge the students and help them grow.\n \n The final reason that teachers should design projects is that they are payed to do so. A significant portion of American tax revenue is used to pay teachers who work across the country. When teachers force students to design projects, the teacher is pawning off his or her own work to the students. Many tax- paying citizens would be incredibly upset to see their taxes go to waste. If teachers are allowed to pawn off their work and still get payed, it sets a very poor example for the young, impressionable students. It teaches the students that you can make others do your work just so you can receive the credit. It would be unethical for any teacher to force their own student into fulfilling the job and tasks of a teacher.\n \n In conclusion, all school projects should be designed by the teacher because it would be morally irresponsible if they did not. Projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more education preparation than students, the students tend to avoid hard work, and teachers are payed to design projects and classwork. If we allow students to design projects, the American education system would be doing a great disservice to the young students of today, and the the leaders of tomorrow.Â  Â",

      "It is much more enjoyable to have the freedom to explore individually. This freedom allows individuals to reach their full potential. Schools that assign summer projects should give students the privilege to explore their interests, while encouraging creativity. Furthermore, schools that assign summer projects should allow students to design their own project because all students are under different circumstances and students should be allowed to be creative, especially in environments outside of school.\n \n It is inevitable for students to have different interests, hobbies, and circumstances. For example, some students may enjoy staying in the comfort of their home while others may enjoy the adventures of the outdoors. All students partake in different activities during the summer; it could include a summer job, sports team, or vacations. All of these factors influence a student's life, and this sets one student apart from another. Each student should be able to incorporate the experiences of their summer break into their project, eliminating the regulatory aspect of a teacher-designed project.\n \n For some students, regulation and routine can be exhausting. The whole school year is an on-going cycle of the same routine, with little variations. Summer break should quite literally be a break from that, allowing students to stray away from the same routine. For this reason, schools should encourage creativity and free-will through summer projects. Furthermore, allowing students to design their own project gives them a sense of control which might encourage students to actually complete the project.\n \n Some may argue that student-designed projects are a bad idea because students need discipline and the possibility that the goal of continuous learning would not be achieved is greater. This argument is false because discipline is not always effective. Guiding students down the right path while encouraging their own ideas is a more effective approach to helping students learn. Even though a clear outline of directions are given to the student, if a student finds no enjoyment in the process, then it is less likely the project will even be completed. The goal is not to control the student, but to aid the process of learning.\n \n Simply giving students the freedom to design their own projects allows then to take advantage of their different circumstances and opportunities while implementing creativity. Assigning summer projects to assure students continue learning is an excellent idea, but allowing students to design their own projects may be more effective because all students are different. Anyone can complete a project with step-by-step instructions, but what matters is what is learned through the process. One set of explicit directions cannot satisfy every single students' needs and/or wants in a learning environment. In conclusion, the process of completing the project is more important than just getting it done.",

Teachers should give summer assignments to the students during summer break because it is very long break and children usually forget. So the teacher creates these assignments for the students to relearn and get more knowledge through projects that might help them in future or their career. However, I think that teachers should be the one designing the projects because it keeps the teacher assure that students are learning important information that might be helpful in their future.",

      "During the summer, many students usually do not do anything school related during this time. They would most likely forget what they had learned from the previous school year. Some schools have given the students projects to do during the summer but the projects are usually designed by teachers. However, it would be better if the projects were designed by the students themselves.\n \n When a student designs a summer project, it would give them more motivation to work on it. If people were to do things they wanted, it would make them more comfrontable and motivated to perform the task. Whenever there are summer assignments, they are usually made by teachers. Some students will still work on the project, but it would be more easier to do if the students were the ones who made the project. A student would usually prefer if they could design the summer assignment themself instead of the teacher.\n \n Having the students create the summer project can also be enjoyable for them. Usually when a person does something they want to do, it would usually be something of their interest. Students would less likely perform a task if it were something that did not interest them or that was disliked by the them. Having a school project designed by students would further make the students more motivated to design and complete the summer assignment since they would create it in a style they are interested in.\n \n Letting a student design their own summer project would also show what the student still remembers any knowledge from the school year and put it into the project. If students did not have much interests or lacked enough content to put into the project, they would most likely add content they had still remembered from the school year into the school project and this would help show if letting the students design the project was effective or not in terms of what they had still remembered from the school year.\n \n With all the ideas the students could have in designing a summer project, there are still some issues that can occur when a student designs the summer assignment. They could go off track with the project and not put in any academic related content into the project. There are also a few times where a student might actually lack ideas to add into the project which later might end up not having much of a project at all. However, this is why there are summer projects, it is to have students continue learning during the summer. Schools should still have the students design the project themselves.\n \n Students will most likely forget what they have learned if they were not given a summer project. But if they were given one and had to design it themselves, it would have many benefits such as: giving them more motivation, enjoying the project whenever they work on it, and showing what they have learned from the school year. That way, the students would overall continue learning through the summer while also enjoying themselves.",

      "The time off of school during summer break is always looked forward to by students and teachers, but it doesn't mean the school work stops. Summer projects are a way to ensure that students can continue to learn information over the break, but many students would not want to complete them. Although teacher-designed projects would be beneficial for learning in more detail, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows for the students to be more creative, have more freedom, and be more engaged in their project. Student-designed projects allow for students to feel like the project is less of a requirement, and rather more of an enjoyable activity.\n \n Creativity is exactly what students need in order to complete projects in a more effective way. When students design their own project, they let their minds flow freely. This allows for the creation of projects that the students actually are interested in, which helps them become more engaged about whatever the project was about. It is a common belief that teachers should design projects so they can get their students to learn exactly what they need to, and that a student-designed project is not sufficient enough because students will not learn what they need to. However, a project by students allows them to learn content even better because they are choosing what they want to create, not being assigned it, and this creation allows them to explore content in a way that a teacher can't provide. For example, if a student had to create an instrument for music class from scratch, they would be a lot more interested in that than just making a variation of a particular instrument again. The creativity in designing a project is what students need to learn content in a way that is interesting to them, which helps them learn better during a time period where they don't even want to be doing work.\n \n When a student designs their own project, there are very few restrictions applied. This is good because the students can learn required content however they want to, and they will most often choose to learn it in a way that is effective for them, which a teacher can't always provide. There is the argument that teachers can just give students a variety of options to choose from with a project, and that that freedom in choice will help students learn in a way beneficial to them but unfortunately that just isn't the case. Many students never get to create a project that they actually want to make, and teachers often just repeat options over and over again that students are already familiar with. For example, what if a teacher just kept giving out the same current events question, and a student never got to answer the question they were actually interested in? The freedom in designing a project allows a student to actually want to learn content, since they choose a way to learn content that would be fun to them. A student-designed project over summer would allow students to freely choose how they want to learn, which is exactly what is needed since many students do not feel motivated to work on school over summer.\n \n Many students who complete projects throughout their school careers are not engaged in their work, and are just focused on getting a project done by the deadline with all the requirements. A student-designed project would allow students to feel more engaged in their work and not just worry about when it's due, but rather what they are learning throughout the process. Many people think that teachers can fix this problem by allowing students to choose what is required in the project, for example requiring students to pick 15 vocabulary words out of 30 to include in a newspaper project. This just isn't the same as letting a student pick out what they design though, as students would actually feel motivated to create a good project since it is something they want to complete. Students would feel more engaged in their project and feel like it was less forced if they had the ability to design it themselves.\n \n Required summer projects by some schools would be most beneficial if they were student-designed, because it would allow for students to be more creative, feel more freedom, and be more engaged in the overall process of learning through a project. This is especially important for summer projects because many students in the summer do not want to do any school work, so a teacher assigning a student another forced project would not motivate them to complete it, while if the student got to design it themselves, they would be more interested and likely create a better project while learning more. Teachers do have the ability to design a project that students would enjoy, but the student-designed project truly allows for more learning by the students because it is more entertaining and an overall better experience.",

    essay:
      "What is something that interests you or a certain subject that interests you? This is a question that schools, who require students to complete summer projects, should ask the students. It is very important to understand what interests the students who are doing these projects. When students are doing a project they are not interested in, they are not as creative with it and they do not learn as much. I know from personal experience that when I am doing a project that interests me, I do so much better and I learn so much more about the subject. It is very beneficial for both the students and the teachers. If some students do not like it or are not interested enough, they might end up not doing the project or getting a really bad grade on it. I believe student-designed projects would be the best way to go because they will learn better and more efficiently, they will get better grades, which is very important, and it will help them learn throughout their break so that they learn so much more.\n \n The first reason that I think student-designed projects would be better, is because they will be more interested in it if they pick something that they are passionate about. The project could be about subjects in school like Math, Science, English, or anything that is related to nature because those are some beneficial things to learn about. I know, from experience, that doing a project that interests you is so much more beneficial. When I was a freshman, my English teacher explained to us that we had to write a paper about something that we are passionate and feel very strongly about. We had to finish this paper by the time our summer break was over. It really helped a lot of my fellow classmates learn so much more about the things they are so passionate about. It was so beneficial to all of us. When we got back to school after summer break, everyone got to share what they wrote about. It was very interesting to hear everyone's point of view on certain things. I really enjoyed it.\n \n Another reason that student-designed projects would be better, is because students can be so much more creative with them. For example, if you really love flowers and you are making a big poster project, you can be so creative with it. You can go out and take beautiful pictures, you can draw and color flowers, and you can search for interesting facts about them. Their are so many interesting things to learn about in the world. Students with creative minds should be given the ability to use them in their own way; therefore, I strongly believe they should be able to design their own projects and be creative and spontaneous with them. In order to do the projects, they still need the teacher's consent, but if it is beneficial and helps them learn, the teacher should be fineÂ with it. It is amazing to see what students can do with all their creativity. The teachers can learn so much about their students' ability when they let them get creative.\n \n The third reason I believe student-designed projects are better, is because it can help both the teachers and the students. If teachers just give every student the same project, some students may decide they can cheat off of their friends, especially if they are not interested in the project or just do not want to do it. If you let them design it and let them do the project about something that they love or are interested in, they will not be able to cheat and will do it on their own. It can also help the students get a better grade on it. If the students are getting better grades on it, then the teachers know that they actually learned something over summer break. I think it is very important to keep learning even over break because it keeps your brain fresh and ready to roll when school comes back around.\n \n It is very important to know and understand what interests your students. Many students are so creative but some never get to use their creativity in school, especially if what they are doing does not interest them. It is very important to let them use their artistic abilities or any other talents they have by doing student-designed projects. Student-designed projects are better for learning and could be beneficial for students in the future even after they get out of school. They can learn many skills from doing them and it will help them continue learning. I strongly encourage teachers to let their students design their summer break projects for not only their benefit, but also for the students'. Â Â Â  Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

If students designed summer projects it would make learning in the summer time better for students. Also if students design these summer projects it would be more students looking forward to learning during the summer because students know what is interesting to each other. And if students design summer projects there will be more into learning about school during summer.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by students because they can influence their peers to be smarter. Also if they are designed by students it can keep people off the streets. It can also bring people together and stop a lot of bullying. And when students come together they can make a big impact on the community and influence other to be smart.\n \n Students make everything interesting.

Students can bring the best out of each other and lift each other up when they are feeling down.\n \n Students can bring the best out of other students better than teachers can.

      "Some schools require students to complete summer assignments to make sure that they continue learning over the long summer break. There has been some debate on whether or not these assignments should be designed by students, or designed by teachers. Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because; teachers can create assignments specifically tailored to their class, teachers can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with, and most of the students are not familiar enough with the material to create an assignment by themselves.\n \n The first reason reason why teachers should design their own summer assignment is that the teacher can create an assignment that is specifically tailored for their class. A teacher knows both what material the students will be learning and how they will go about learning it. A teacher could use this knowledge to create an assignment that creates prior learning in an area that they will not cover as much. This will make sure that the students have a greater understanding of a topic withoutÂ needing to take valuable class time to learn it. An example of an assignment like this would be a required reading. Students would be required to read a book about a topic selected by the teacher and complete an assignment to demonstrate understanding of the text. The teacher's contact information would be made available to the students so that any important questions could be answered. With an assignment like this, the students are functionally teaching themselves over the summer. A teacher could also use this assignment to create interest in the class. A teacher could compile all of the topics that students typically find interesting into a sort of class preview that will make students more curious about the class. This curiosity could create a better work environment and allow students to learn even more over the year.\n \n The second reason why teachers should design their own summer assignments is because they can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with. Teachers are aware of which subjects students generally struggle with, and can use that information to help future students. Teachers can use the summer assignment for this by creating prior knowledge about the more difficult subjects. If the students are already somewhat familiar with the material, it will take less class time to teach it. This leaves more time to answer individual questions and help students understand the specific parts that the class is struggling with. An example of how a teacher could do this is by assigning a research paper. If the students are free to do their own research, they will develop an interest in the topic over the course of the writing. The students will be essentially teaching an entire difficult subject to themselves. The students could then present their essay to the class to show their individual findings. The class will teach each other about their own findings until every individual is competent in the subject. The teacher's contact information should be made available so that any questions that come up can be answered, but the students should rely mostly on other credible sources for their information.\n \n The final reason why teachers should create their own summer assignments is because students are not familiar enough with the material to create assignments for themselves. All the information that students usually have about a class before they take it is the title of the class, and a brief description of the material. The students know almost nothing going into a class while teachers have experience teaching the subject and know how to best introduce it to students. There can be no argument for students creating their own assignments because they are simply not knowledgeable enough to design a focused and useful assignment. If students were to create their own assignments, there would be several problems. One main issue is that the students' projects would not be focused on the acutal course, but on what they thought the couse was loosly about. Students do not know much going into a class and can not possibly know enough about the class to create a well designed assignment that will effectively introduce them to the material. Another issue is that students will try to make it easier on themselves. Students do not always have the best work ethics ,especially over the summer. If given the choice, they will always choose an easier rout even if it means sacrificing a part of their education. If students are allowed to create their own assignments, they will most likely create something that is not challenging at all and therefor not useful. If a summer assignment is not neither challenging nor introducing new material, it is functionally useless. The final issue is the fact that teachers will have no way to accurately grade an entirely student created project. The teacher has no way of judging quality if the details of the assignment are unclear. If each individual comes in with a different assignment, the teacher will have no choice but to hand out arbitrary grades based on nothing at all. A project without a rubric is impossible to grade.\n \n There aresome schools that require students to complete assignments over their summer break. The objective of these assignments is to ensure that the students continue to learn over the long summer break. There has been debate about whether or not these summer assignments should be designed by teachers or by students. The summer assignments should be designed by teachers for a multitude of reasons including; teachers can create assignments specifically tailored to their class, teachers can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with, and most of the students are not familiar enough with the material to create an assignment by themselves.",

    essay:
      "Whether students and teachers like it or not, some schools require students to still learn over their summer breaks. One way that these students have to learn is through projects. These projects should be teacher-designed instead of student designed for many different reasons. Although students can be smart, they are not experts on the field that the project would be based on, so for a better chance of more accurate learning, students should leave the project designing for their teachers. Teachers are also the ones who create the lesson plans, so they know what students need to know for the course, making them better candidates for creating the projects than students are. Lastly, student-designed projects can be harder to grade than teacher-designed projects. For these reasons, students should not be forced to create summer projects for their peers; the job of being a teacher should be left for the teachers.\n \n Not every single student in every single class is at the mastery level of a topic. Kids who have a 99% over all for the class still do not know everything that their is to know about a specific subject. Teachers on the other hand go to school for the subject they want to teach and teach the same class repeatedly. This lets them specialize in what they teach and have constant reminders about how to do what needs to be done for the subject. These years of experience that teachers have in their field should not be wasted by letting students design projects. Students often make mistakes, and other students should not have to learn how to do these mistakes simply because a student designed a project rather than the teacher, a professional in the field.\n \n Students are not the ones who design and follow lesson plans for their academic courses. Teachers are the ones who make the lesson plans and know which materials students are responsible for knowing and not knowing as well. Since these teachers know what students need to learn and the point of these summer projects is simply for learning, this is another reason why students should not be designing these projects. Making a students who does not know the entire course layout of the class or the time period in which each subject in the class needs to be learned makes this task to heavy to put onlyÂ on students. Students who have not created an entire lesson plan based on what needs to be taught and learned throughout the year should not be forced to then come up with a summer based project to teach their peers, when they do not even know what needs to be taught in what specific time period.\n \n Finally, student-made projects could have more potential grading complications that teacher-made projects. Students still not fully having mastered the subject if left to grade might incorrectly mark another students project since they do not fully understand the subject themselves. Also if a student is the one responsible for grading, they may overlook or even correct their friends projects simplyÂ to help them get a better grade or to not feel the guilt that comes with marking off something of you friend's work. On the other hand, if teachers are the ones grading student-designed projects, there is the chance that teachers will not understand the student's rubric that they created or there is even a chance that the teachers will not even understand what the students are hoping to accomplish through the project(s) that they have created. To keep grading accurate and fair, teachers should be the ones to both design and grade these summer projects.\n \n There are too many complications that come with making students design projects for their peers. Students are not experts on the subjects, so making them create projects over professionals in the subject is not fair to the students or their peers who need these summer projects to learn from. These students are also not the ones who make lesson plans, so they do not know what should be taught in what amount of time. Lastly, for grading fairness, it is better to have teachers be the ones to design and grade these summer projects. Although the idea of letting students create these projects for their peers can be fun and help with their learning of the subject, there are too many other avoidable complications that can be solved by leaving teachers to be the ones in chargeÂ of these projects. Teachers should be the ones doing the jobs of teaching, not students.Â  Â Â Â",

      "The project should be student-designed for various reasons. Children of any age have very creative minds and that could be very good when it comes to this project. Being that it is a summer project, it would be a lot easier on the students to make the project student-designed. A lot of children have jobs or get jobs in the summer so it would be better on those kids and others to have a self-designed project. The project being student-designed would cause students to pick their strongest topics, get more creative, and manage their time properly.\n \n Students should be able to plan their own projects. If the students were able to plan the project, they could pick a topic they felt they were strong in. Having a teacher pick your theme or topic could be very hard if you were not strong on the topic they picked. For example, a teacher assigns a project on the solar system and that child doesn't know much about it, it's not going to be a A+ project. The student knows a lot about Albert Einstein, but he could not pick his own topic. Student-designed wouldÂ resultÂ to better grades.Â A self-designed project would let the teacher know how her students think and what they feel they are strong in.\n \n Also, you could get more creative when the project is self designed. When you come up with an idea by yourself it makes the project well put together. Students would be able to incorporate all their true colors, true feelings, and lots of meaning into this project. You have no limits when you are designing something that you feel strongly about. For example, with a teacher-designed project you have limits such as a certain amount of words, color, and size. For some students those kind of rules are hard to follow because they want to express their inner self.\n \n Lastly, making the project student designed would result to better grades and finished products. Students would know how much time everything takes to get done and they would not be rushed. Not having a rushed project would result to more passing grades. Students would be more comfortable presenting because they know their projects does not look have to look like everyone's project. They would also let people know how they think by the amount of color, drawings, and length of the project.\n \n In conclusion, it would be a good idea to make the project self-designed. Students have a different mind set from everyone else, so it would be a good way to see how each one thinks. Having a student-designed project could benefit both the teacher and the student in many ways. The teacher could learn a lot about the school year ahead of her and what kind of students she going to have. And students would find their inner selvesÂ and natural talent without even knowing. The project should be an student-designed project because students could pick their strongest topics, get more creative, and manage their time properly.Â",

      "I believe students should design summer projects instead of teachers, what do you think? i believe so and here is why. Most students think more alike other students because most of them have the same knowledge than others but. That doesn't mean that the whole school will have students that could think like teachers. By all means this proves that there is a lower chance those students with high developed knowledge will be the ones doing the summer projects for others to complete. The students that do create some of the summer projects will make sure not to make them to hard or to easy that way the students doing them can surly keep learning during break withoutÂ stressing about it. The students that make the summer project will also make them easier for there fellow classmates. Some of the students that are doing the summer project could be stressing about it but that also means they won't make it to difficult because they would want to get over with it already and focus on something else to get there minds distracting. So that we they cannot be thinking so much about school. As wellÂ as the students doing them won't stress as much about them because they'll know it's not to difficult and can do it any time during the summer, such being the last week or the last day so they can have all summer to them selves. Not having to think about school. When students aren't thinking about school that doesn't mean they're not learning it, just means they're trying to get there head off of something that highly stresses them about a lot of work or having to deal with for a long time and that's the only time they can get a break from it and not stress about school. The reason being of students doing them than instead of teachers they also won't have to do a lot of writing or work for starters. Students will be sure to not make them as long because they know what it feels like to get assigned a longÂ and stressfulÂ assignment especially over the summer break that is the only time you actually get a break from school. Students also doing the assignments will help out teachers to also get a break and focus on other important related stuff they have as well. The students creating the summer projects can also be more open mindedÂ after doing them and grow they're knowledge as wellÂ as learning better and thinking of ideas more often for school. Teachers can review the students work and see how fine they do. The students who do well creating can continue to do so if they feel goo about themselves doing it for the other students that weren't so bright at it can give out ideas and help out the students doing them. I believe other schools and principals will be impressed by having a school with students creating they're summer projects and that is wonderful. I believe that having students createÂ the summer projects is an outstanding idea for the community and school they will think of them differently and have a better picture of themselves. This argument has been good because it will open the eyes of many students and have them be brave enough to put themselves up for the challenge. If you believe students should create these summer projects instead of teachers write your own prompts to see what you guys have in mind. I think my argument is well stated and many teachers will surly think about letting it happen. Don't you believe so as well? Yes indeed you do.",

      "My name is Generic_Name, I have took the position that the summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to designed their own summer projects, because it will allow them to get as creative as they want. For an example, they can use their own pictures, color, and words.\n \n The pictures of the students self designed projects is the most important part of the project. It descibes what the person is talking about. It also provides extra details about what the student made their project to be. Pictures can describe what the people based their projects off. The pictures set off the main idea of the student summer project.\n \n The color of the student project is a color code. That means the students can use their own color to descibe one part of their project. Students can also use their color to make their summer projects colorful. In other words, color can be use to make students projects creative. The reason for the color is to make the project bigger and persuade the audience to look at it.\n \n The wodrs of the student summer project is basically to state the meaning of the project. That means it describes the Pictures, and the color they used in their project. The words are supporting details for their project. The main usage for the words in the project is to support the main idea of the project. The reason for the words is to make the the audience want to read it by supporting what the project is about.\n \n In conclusion, I will take the position that Students should be able to designed their own projects for the summer. It is easier for students to create their own projects, because their minds move faster than some teachers. some students have the ability to create fun stories for their projects. I have supported my Position with details and reasons for me choosing this position. I hope you enojoy this Essay have a great day.",

      "Since the increase in school attendance, homework, a form of continual, at-home learning, was created to eliminate forgotten knowledge and stimulate academic development outside of the classroom. Due to this, new forms of such medium have developed transpiring into what is now know as summer assignments. Although, there is still much debate centered around if such projects should be student or teacher designed. Although, a student designed summer assignment may be beneficiary to the student in terms of difficulty and creativity, in order to better actively promote proper continual education and prepare children for their upcoming course load, all summer projects should be based off of a teacher's model.\n \n As humans are confronted with adversity, many choose the path of least difficulty. This trend of human nature can be seen dating back to the first man. Through evolution man was taught always to take the ladder of the two in order to insure survival; the modern interpretation of this instinctual thought would be classified as laziness. The average student, just like Chromagnum Man, will typically not go the extra mile if given the easier path; therefore, in order ensure proper brain stimulus and appropriateÂ student effort, a teacher-designed summer assignment is necessary.\n \n In prepare students for the upcoming challenges and expectations regarding their course selection, students must be allowed to model expectations from a given, teacher-assigned, summer assignment. Children are taught on the principles of mimicking behavior. Therefore, by modeling expectations, students are allowed to prepare for their future courses through a natural monkey-see, monkey-do pattern. In order ensure proper learning, a appropriate model for a learning basis should be given to students to better prepare for the year to come.\n \n Additionally, in order to better prepare for students' future academic course loads, teachers, as fellow advocates for education, should be inclined to facilitate proper thought processes in academics by the means of a carefully designed project. Examples of proper learning environments are already seen through the public schooling system, so inherently this should be expected at a must in order to stimulate the brain at home just as it has throughout the school year previously and to come. through this thought process is has become imperative that the modern child needs not only a active learning goal, but also a way in which to achieve it; that way comes in the form of a teacher-designed summer assignment.\n \n As previously touched on, the thought of allowing for a creative, student-designed project is one that naturally comes to the mind of many students as well as teachers; though this thought process inevitably roots from laziness. As discussed prior, the student will always take the ladder of the route eventually reverting to a lazy state if improper precautions are taken; in actuality, facilitating such behavior.\n \n Throughout this process of argument, it has become indicative that the matter in which thought is stimulated and perceived in consequential to the manner in which it is given. If given the option, most students will take the road most traveled as a natural reaction to adversity. Additionally, students must be prepared for proper course load through a guided thought process. In order to achieve a proper though process, a appropriate learning environment must be achieved at home through use of teacher modeling (a teacher-designed summer assignment). The allowance of free rain over projects under the fallacy of creativity spurs laziness over both student and educator as evident to human biology through evolution. With the facilitation of such student needs, the brain is allowed to prosper and continually develop intellectually to create yet another productive member of society.",

      "Some schools are given summer project to assure students continue learning throughout the summer. Since, the summer project is completed over the summer I believe it should be student-designed. First reason being is cause students should be able to make the project as they please as this embraces their imagination as to how they would like it to be and not just lock up any possible ideas they might have. Another being, it'll let the student complete the project to the best of their ability. Lastly, teacher-designed projects can get a bit stressful and overwhelming. Summer projects can benefit the students more if they're student-designed.\n \n Student-designed projects allow the student to create the project freely with no restraints. For example, several weeks ago my forensics teacher gave her classes a project based on serial killers. The project was all up to the student except for the fact that it had to be a cereal box. It was fairly easy, we just had to pick a serial killer that we were interested in and also write fun and interesting facts about said serial killer. Very little were bad or plain, meanwhile, others were fun and entertaining with games, crosswords, toys, and other activities! I believe since we were able to do it on our ownÂ it enabled the class to receive higher scores on the project; therefore, we should be given student-designed projects.\n \n Teacher-designed projects can get a bit excessive at times with a lotÂ of work which eventually lead to stressful and overwhelming situations. For example, before this school year started several friends of mine were gonna take AP US History, which they had received a summer project for the class. Their was summer was okay until about a week before school started. That's when they realizedÂ they should've started weeks ago as the project was a packet with several pages of questions. Frantically and desperatelyÂ they began their summer assignment, and well they may have lost some sleep due to staying up late but they ended up finishing. Although, my best friend had it the worse since she began her day with morning conditioning, followed by her going to work, and lastly afternoon practice and the stress from the summer project did't help. AP teacher-designed projects are lengthy and extra, which is why one should prefer student-designed projects.\n \n In conclusion student-designed projects allow a student to be free with their own creativity and knowledge which allows them to work to the best of their ability. Also they don't produce as much stress as the teacher-designed projects. Lastly from other people one learns some teacher-designed projects can induce more stress into ones life which leads to other negative effects. Which is why teachers should make student-designed projects to let their students creativity roam free.Â",

      "During summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. Because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. Summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. However, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn, and students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.\n \n Since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective. They know what the students need to learn based on the curriculum, so it is ideal for them to decide what they should study over the break. Students will get more out of the assignment if the teacher prepares an assignment that relates directly to what they will learn in class when school begins. It will also strengthen their knowledge and possibly reinforce what they had learned before.\n \n Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. Teachers can design projects that is relevant to the curriculum of the class and plan out what is necessary and useful to know versus what is not. In addition, teachers usually expose basic ideas and important concepts that will help students to make connections to what they learned through the summer assignment. These teacher-designed also provides some insight for the student on what to expect in the courses that they take.\n \n Having teachers make their own summer projects will expose the material that students need to know when they go back to school. It will help students to feel more comfortable coming to class and ready to begin learning. Through these projects, students have studied and have a better understanding of the curriculum of the class as the teacher directed the students on content they need to know. These projects also help students to gradually feel familiar with concepts they learn in the beginning of the school year rather than jumping straight ahead to learning something new.\n \n Not only do teacher-designed projects enforce learning and help students to get more comfortable with the content of the class, but they also prepare students before the upcoming school year begins. It is ideal for teachers to design such projects as they know most about the curriculum of the class, and it allows them to prepare a useful tool for students to study to get familiar with concepts and important ideas of the class. These projects are a small exposure of what students are expected or need to know and will help them to be more successful when they begin learning in their classes. Â Â Â",

      "Teachers should be the ones to design our summer projects for many different reasons. They know what is needed for us to know by the time the next school year comes around, most of the time they have a better understanding of what we need to learn , and if kids were to design the summer projects they will most likely forget many factors or make it too easy and not put as much effort into it. These summer projects help and make sure kids are still learning and not forgetting everything that they have been taught throughout the school year.\n \n Teachers should gather together and create the summer projects based off what they know that we will need to know for the upcoming years. This can be really helpful because most kids think that some things we learn will not be useful or won't do us any good but the only ones who really know what will be needed for the years to come, are the teachers. This can be such an advantage for the students and teachers. Instead of the teachers spending so much time in the beginning of the year going back over what we learned the year before they can just get right into the lesson because what needed to be reviewed has already been refreshed in our memories over the summer because of the project. By teachers creating the summer project, it can help make class time more valuable and it can help spend less time on reviewing things from previous years.\n \n If the students were to design the summer project way more things would come into effect, like how the project will be graded, what is on there vs. what should've been on there, and everything important we left off. As students we dont know what we need to learn that is clearly why we are being taught. Teachers have the best way of helping us understand what we need to learn and most of the time they know what is best for our learning. That is why we have teachers, so we can be taught what we need to know. Students all have different ways of learning, and yes not every teacher is can cater to every student and teach them the way they needed to be taught but at the end of the day the teachers are the ones who help us the most with our education and teach us the important things we need to know. Not every student can just come up with a summer project already knowing everything that should be incorporated into it. Teachers have a much better understanding of what needs to be taught and what we need to go over so we can understand it better and know our material.\n \n A big part in learning for many students is being challenged. Do you really think if a student designed the summer project that it will be challenging ? or will it be so easy that it doesn't really help the student grasp the concept of the material ? Many students find ways to do just the bare minimum to get them by, or they find ways to get the project done without really knowing what they are even being taught or to get it done without knowing what they are really doing. Many teachers find or have many different ways to help students understand what is being taught and also make sure that student is actually trying and getting by so easy. Most students will do what they have to do to get them by and that isnt really helping us learn.\n \n In conclusion it is in the best interests of most students if the teachers make the summer projects because they have a much better understanding of what can help us and what we need to know for the upcoming school year. In most classes the teachers spend the beginning of the school year going over material from the previous year, if the teacher makes the summer the project they can easily see what we do need to go over and what we dont and it can save us so much time in the classroom to learn new things instead of going over what we already know and have been taught.Â",

      "Do you believe it's fair for students to choose whatever project they want? Students shouldn't be able to choose their own project, because they could be choosing the easiest one or the least amount of work. They could also be doing something they've already done, so they wouldn't be learning anything new. Although some might agree otherwise, personal experiences, other students, and teachers prove that students should not be choosing their summer projects. .\n \n For example, personal experiences, I've learned more stuff through teacher designed summer projects. When I was assigned a book to read over summer, I thought it would be boring and I wouldn't be able to finish it. The type of book that I had to read was not my type, but I ended up loving it and was interested in finishing it. If my teacher didn't assign this project to me I would have never found out I was interested in these types of books and I would have never learned some things not only from the book, but about me. Some may disagree with this, but teacher designed summer projects help students be more responsible and get them to learn more information.\n \n Shown through other students, some take advantage of teachers who give them a student designed project and they choose something they really know and don't have to learn anything new. Some students don't like to learn anything or do anything related to school and they end up choosing the easiest way out of that school work. In this case those students who didn't want to learn anything end up with less knowledge then others in their class. By giving the whole class the same summer project, they will be all on the same page next year when they go over it and everyone will understand.\n \n Lastly teachers, they all have a different mind set, so every teacher teaches differently. A teacher could be letting their student's do anything they want for a project in class, out of class, or for summer. If one does do that, some student's may have a hard time and some may like it better that way and if they do the students may have a different amount of work on the projects which wouldn't be fair to them. Some may say otherwise; however, a teacher designed summer project will help the students learn and help the be able to work on their own. This will also help they get ready for work, so they would be able to do things on their own.\n \n This is important because some teachers don't think it affects students, but most of the time it does, students may take advantage with teachers providing a student designed summer project. When a student was able to choose all of their past summer projects and then one year they can't choose it. They would struggle and wouldn't have a teacher to help them because it's summer time. If a student is able to choose their projects all the time they wouldn't be learning anything new. This explains why student's shouldn't shouldn't be able to choose their summer projects shown through personal experiences, other students, and teachers.Â",

      "Some may argue that teacher-design projects are the best way for students to continues to learn during their break, but summer projects should be student-designed because of these three reasons: it allows the students creativity to flow through their projects, when allowed to chose what they want to do, students work better on projects;Â because learning should be fun, students tend to enjoy the work they're given when allowed to do it their own way.\n \n As children, our imagination tends to run wild, hence the crazy colorful drawings we bring home from kindergarten, or the weird concoctions we put together in our make believe kitchen; But as we get older we tend to lose that, weather it may be through age or other things, our imagination isn't as it was when we were younger. When given free will to do whatever we want on a project, students get to tap into that wild imagination we have locked away somewhere in our brain, a creativity that we don't get to use as often as we could. some of this is due to having teachers decide on what or how we should do our work. At times we are given a sheet of paper that tells us how and what our project should look like; because of this our creativity has no space in the box that we are forced to fit into. If given a chance to choose, more often than not, not only teachers, but our peers and our parents get to see what its kind of like inside our brains. Through our creativity you can learn what the person behind the creativity is like.\n \n When a student is given free will over a task given, it is a high probability that they will do their best to make the project amazing. In many cases student do better on any sort of assignment when given the chance to choose how they want to complete said assignment. One of the best feeling a student has is having a peace of mind knowing that they turned in an project that they did their best and worked hard on, and knowing that their hard work payed off. Through this, students learn to do their best in anything that they do, no matter it being school work or work outside of school. My Dad would always say \"Your school is like your second home, what you learn at home is what you will apply and use in the real world.\" Giving the chance to students, if the summer projects were to be student-designed, students will work better and harder on it than if they were teacher-designed.\n \n As I stated previously, learning should be fun. it is human nature to want and to enjoy presenting a project that we've worked extra hard on to our peers and our teachers. Being able to do what we want when it come to projects is enjoyable for the students and the teacher. People work better when they enjoy the task given to them. Using our creativity on a certain subject makes the learning experience enjoyable. The process in which we go through creating projects should be enjoyable. From the planing to the reaserch to assembling the the project, every step it takes can be a fun learning experience, if given the chance.\n \n As we grow up we get lesser chances of using our creativity. Having teacher-designed projects, most of the time, hinders our creativity from coming through our work. Student-designed projects will give the student a chance to show their creativity, and through this they will work better on their project, which will then make it a fun learning experience not only for them but for their peers and even their teachers.

      "Teachers have more often than not been the epicenter of academic negativity. There always has been and always will complain about teaching styles. If students could take the steering wheel, chances are they will understand the material taught and retain that information. That said, summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed because it allows for a more positve and creative atmosphere, improved scheduling, and higher pass rates.\n \n Virtually nobody wants to spend their summer doing classwork and projects. However, if the projects were both educational and entertaining, then summer would be that much more enjoyable. It would also allow the content to soak in much better. For instance, say a student wanted to to a project on auto mechanics. With a teacher designed rubric, the would want the project to be somewhat generc in its presentation. On the flip side of that, if the rubric was composed by students, that student now has a variety of options as far as presentation. Creativity and individudality are things that schools should integrate into their cirriculum.\n \n Also, if projects were student based, then the due dates would be rather reasoable. intstead of having to worry about one big poject, student could decide to break the project up into shorter, more managable dates. It would also allow for a more balanced schedule in general.\n \n Some people say that if the old rubric works, then keep on using it. They have been working for years now, so why change it; because students are sick and tired of repititon. Doing the same thing over and over for an extended amount of time is not good. It starts to blur the summers together, to the point where someone will not remember what they did because of the summers being so similar. If projects are mandatory over the summer, schools should make them enjoyable and worth the students' time. That way they undestand the material and they pass that class.\n \n With that being said, student designed projects are the much better route. With students being able to choose the subject and presentation style of the project, it will allow for creative juices to flow through everyones' minds and really intrigue the students. It would also allow for better time management on the development of said project. Finally, if students are interested in their projects and they genuinely want to do it, then the grades will improve. They will also be able to gather and retain the information that is being introduced to them. So, if you are thinking about doing this Generic_School, do it right",

      "How would you like to spend your summer? A teacher controlling your summer or you controlling your own summer? If some schools require students to do projects during their summer break, then these projects should be student designed. There are plenty of reasons why these projects should be student designed. First reason is since students are taking their break time to do school work then students should be able to design they own project. Second reason is if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. Third reason is students will take a break from school subjects and be able to design their own project.\n \n First, students are taking their own break time to do school projects, then they should be able to design their own projects. For example, if a student is going on vacation for 80 days and summer break is 78 days then this means he wont have that enough time to complete his assigned project. If its an assigned project then this takes time, you have to do researches. But if the project is self designed then the student can possibly finish the project in within 2-4 hours since it is self designed.\n \n Secondly, if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. For example, it is up to students if they want to complete the project in 1 or 2 months. They can take their own time and go on their own phase. Unlike if its teacher assigned, then this means there is most likely a due date assigned by the teacher.\n \n Lastly, if the project is student designed then students will take a break from school subjects and be able to designÂ theirÂ own project. For example, school subjects can be stressful at times. A lot of students do not like social studies. If the project is about social studies then students will get frustrated. So if the project is student designed then the student can do the project based on any topic they feel comfortable doing.\n \n In conclusion, these are my three reasons why the school projects should be student designed, since students are taking their break time to do school work then students should be able to design they own project. Another reason is if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. Last reason is students will take a break from school subjects and be able to design their own project.Â",

      "Student-designed projects are great, they persuade students to be more unique and creative on their project. There is an ongoing debate over whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are better, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed.\n \n There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Students are more creative than teachers. For example, I like to add more color and pictures to my project. When students work on project by their selves they tend to understand it better because there is no pressure on them. Furthermore, no one is telling the students what to read orÂ write on their project. When a student designs there own project it looks easier to them, and it also builds their confidence up. Another reason summer projects should be student-designed is because they better the student skills. For example, when I go off too college the projects will be easier to me because ImÂ already experienced, also if i was to do a presentation I would know what certain points I want to say, and what parts I would like to start from.\n \n There additional reasons why a student-designed summer project is more beneficial. Students can show the project to their friends and family, and that would help because if the student is wrong on some parts of the project they have people around that can correct them. However, when students show their project to their friends and family that can help better the student presentation and social skills. Due to the summer being a break from school, students have a lot of time to work on the project. For example, no one is rushing the student, therefore, the student can add extra work. The summer gives the students a lot of time to be more unique. Also, summer projects that are student-designed are better because the teacher may want the students to turn the project in earlier than expected. Another additional reason is that student-designed projects may be easier, because the student might not understand how the teacher designed it, or may not understand the instructions. For example, if summer already started and the student did not understand the teacher instructions, the student can ask the teacher to email the instructions to them.\n \n Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed. During the summer student-designed projects are best because they better student's skills, student have a lot of time to work on the project, and students can understand the project better. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are best, but this is not true. Ultimately, student-designed projects are better because they persuade students be more unique and creative.",

      "Summer is the time of year students get to relax from going to school for 10 months. Though many people think it is unfair to give them out, projects can be administered in the summer. Regardless, if projects are given out during the summer, students should be given the option to create their own projects. Student-designed projects allow students to think independently, give motivationÂ to do the project, and allow the student to express themselves personally.\n \n While teachers do an impeccable job teaching, a teacher-designed project continues institutionalized learning. Projects that allow students to construct them make room for independent thinking. Independent thinking has major benefits such as better responses in class, because students absorb the information they learn for topics they liked researching, and a desire to learn outside of the class room. Projects enhances independent thinking by allowing the student decide what beneficial topic they want their project to be on and what time frame they want to create the project in.\n \n When a child is given the choice to do something on their own, a better outcome is seen. For instance, a child who is given a choice for what to eat for dinner is more likely to eat all of their food versus a child who is not given the choice. The same thing applies to a student and their project. Because students will be allowed to choose what to do their summer project on, they are more likely to complete the project. Student-designed projects also increases the effort put into the project. When a student is doing a project that they like, they are more likely to put in more effort versus a project that has been chosen for them to do over the time where a student is supposed to be having fun.\n \n Teacher-designed projects are extremely general. They do not adhere to the feelings of specific students. On top of that, teacher-designed projects are like the same projects administered throughout the year which demolishes a creative experience. Students who create their own projects get to express themselves. Students express themselves by choosing projects which mean something to them whether it is short story to a diorama of the solar system. An example of this is the Personal Project which is distributed the last year of the IBMYP program. Students are given the choice of a topic to talk about and present is. Many students were motivated to do the project and present it because they were allowed to express what was important to them.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed projects are more beneficial to one than a teacher-designed project. Creating one's own project allows independent thinking, which formulates a desire to learn without the push of a teacher. Additional reasons students should be allowed to choose their projects is because it increases motivation by making them want to complete a project they enjoy and because they can express their feelings through a personal connection with the project they are completing.",

      "Summer is the best time of the year for most of the students; it is the season that brings them joy and memories. But, without an organized summer plan, the students are very likely to forget what they have learned in the school year. Because of that, some education systems suggest summer projects for students to practice lessons during their break. However, these assignments that are designed by teachers seem to be unreasonable overload and can ruin the summer vacation that the students have been waiting for. Therefore, students and teachers will both be beneficial in learning and teaching if the lessons are well-designed. Although some may say that teacher-designed projects will consist of more important lessons, those that are designed by the students will surely be effective due to its interesting topics and reasonable schedule.\n \n Students will be more motivated if the topics come from their fields of interest. With these lessons, there will be less delay for students to work. They will explore new lessons that will later be helpful in their future careers; they would be no longer summer projects but are life lessons. For instance, in Generic_School, yearly, there are Capstone topics for students to research a topic of their own interest. There are still requirements that the topics need to meet in order to assure that students will learn new facts from their research; but, the lessons' topics are designed by the students. Because of the new learning structure, more students were involved in the projects which resulted in interesting ideas. These projects let the students to express themselves through learning. Another example, summer field tripsÂ nowadays are mostly created by students, and they are being applied to new lessons more due to their effectiveness in teaching. Letting the students to design the experiences of the lessons means letting they create their own memories of the lessons which will last longer than that of traditional methods. Being able to explore their fields of interest motivates the students, rather than compels them to learn.\n \n Beside having a break and doing school's projects, students should have time for other activities. These activities are the main part of the summer vacation. But, it would be impossible for them to distress and try these new activities if there isn't any time. Junior rising students seem to not have access to summer break due to the overload works in preparingÂ for the SAT and some of the school summer projects. Therefore, if the summer goes on with unreasonable loads of lessons and practices that are needed to be done, there would be lack of access for them to other activities. Summer is also the time for students to explore interesting future careers through internship and jobs opportunities. Consequently, looking at the bigger picture, if a student busy with the summer works from school, he or she will be lost in choosing interesting fields in the future due to their lack of experiences. That says, it is important for students to have time to access new activities that will determine their future.\n \n However, there are people who believe that summer projects that are made by students will not cover enough important information, thus teacher-designed projects are the perfect choice. It is true that important lessons must be covered, but that only should be done during the school year, not during the summer break. Doing so in the summer will distress students even more due to their lack ofÂ free time. If the pressure on students keep gaining, mental diseases like depression and mood changes will appear. There are many students in Generic_School and high schools around the world have gotten mental disorders which origin is from school works. Therefore, the main component of the teaching system should be the effectiveness of the lessons, not the amount lessons that are being taught. This is a major cons of the current education system and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible. And the only ones who can truly understand the problem are the students. Thus the student's opinions towards the structure of the school's system are very important.\n \n Projects and lessons should be designed by the students to guarantee the quality of the lessons. Through interesting topics,students will be more motivated to learn and explore new lessons. They will also have time for new activities, which will eventually help them in life. And more importantly, students will be able to avoid mental diseases, depression, etc; therefore, it creates a healthy generation of young adults. Overall, summer projects that are provided by schools should be created from the opinion and interest of students.",

      "Doing Summer Projects the Right Way\n \n At many high schools, a massive controversy is in the making. As the summer is right around the corner, students are getting prepared for their summer projects. These summer projects are in place to make sure the students never stop learning, and to make sure they are prepared for next year's class. The problem is if these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful.\n \n The first reason why the summer projects should be student-designed is because they are easier to plan into the students' busy schedule. Everyone can agree that the summer time is went students are the busiest. Many go on vacations to foreign nations, visit families in other states, and the list goes on forever. By making the the projects student-designed, it gives the students the ability to look at what they got planned for the summer. The students then can make their projects fit around their schedule. If the project was teacher-designed, then the teacher would not know how to make it where it fits the busy schedules of the students. Therefore, these examples prove that it is better to have projects student-designed.\n \n The second reason why it would be better to have student-designed projects is that it benefits the students more in several ways. Every student has a unique way of learning. Some students learn by listening. Others learn by using their eyes or by touch. By making these projects student-designed, the students can make them to where they can learn the most. An example would be if a visual learner had to make a project on the civil war, then he or she would make a presentation or anything that requires the eyes' engagement, helping them in the long run. If the project is teacher-designed, then the project will be made where it only benefits a small portion of the class. In conclusion, this shows that it benefits the students more to have student-designed projects.\n \n The third reason why it would be beneficial for the students to have student-designed projects is because it is less stressful. by making the projects student-designed, the students know what they are getting into before the summer even begins. If the projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers might overload the students with a bunch of work thinking that it would be the best for the students. Students may have other projects to do for other classes, and this would make it hard for the students to put their best effort into the projects. Students may also have stress from problems not relating to school. An example would be a student who need to work over the summer to help pay the bills. He or she would prefer a project that is student-designed because it takes away that stress that would be with a teacher-designed project. Therefore, it would be a positive impact if the students got student-designed projects.\n \n Many argue that teacher-designed projects would be better for the students. People claim that the teachers know their students well enough, that the students may design projects that are horribly made, or that teachers should have control over how the students learn. It might be true that teachers know their students really well, but the only person who knows the students the best are themselves. For the argument that projects will be horribly made, can be easily solved by having an outline which the students follow. They then make a project that follows that outline while making it their own way. These problems are also easily solved with the proof and evidence listed above, and it is clear that student-designed projects are ultimately better for the students.\n \n In conclusion, because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful, summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. Teacher-designed projects hurt the students learning ability while student-designed projects help it. Now ask yourself if your children are learning to the best of their ability over the summer. Ask them if their summer projects are student-designed or teacher-designed. If they say that they have teacher-designed projects, make sure that problem is addressed knowing that it does not benefit your children in any way.Â",

      "While summer break gives kids a chance to relax at the beach, It can also forgot what they have learned in school. The problem with summer break is that students are more likely to not focus on other opportunities to learn and forgot about what they learned during the school year. If it were to stay like this, then kids could be unprepared for colleges or other schools they want to go to in the future. To resolve this, some schools assign students a project to complete so they can continue earning over the break. However, there are two sides saying that the projects should be student-based or teacher-based. Schools should require students to make student-designed projects because it helps them show their creativity, learn new things during break, and work on their thinking skills.\n \n Some people argue that student-designed projects would not be beneficial because students would have trouble trying to come up with a good idea for their project. There are a few students that struggle with projects because they have to follow a set of rules to complete so they could get a good grade, but some ignore these rules or do not follow the exact instructions their teacher said and get a bad grade on the project. If the projects were teacher-designed, then students can follow how to do the project correctly and lean the information that the teacher wants. While this may be true, it can also help students on their thinking skills.\n \n Students with critical thinking skills are more likely to do better in school. Thinking skills have a positive effect on students because it helps them solve problems efficiently and new techniques that will help them in school. For example, a student completes a teacher-designed project but does not learn much information. Since he did exactly what the teacher wanted, he was not able to research information by himself, which would have helped him develop skills for the future. If the project the student made was student-designed, then he would have been able to learn how to research information and learn new things. This would also help many students to learn during break.\n \n Learning during summer break is good because it make sure students never forget what they learned from the school year. Summer break is good for students to take a break, but all the information they learned during the school yearÂ would be a waste. When they go back to school after summer break, then they would have no clue about what they learned, which is a problem because some of their classes might be similar to what they took last year. Giving students a project that is based on their own work would help out on their learning capabilities.\n \n Creativity is important for students because it shows what ideas they can come up with. Some students show their creativity by taking an art class, which helps them not only learn about art, but about new skills that will help them in the future. Teacher-designed projects may help students learn, but it will not help them reach their potential. Student-designed projects make students able to express their creativity and what they have learned in an interesting way.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed projects are the best way for students to learn during break. It helps them develop new thinking skills that would help them in future classes. Students can not only learn about new things during break, but also remember the information they learned during the school year. It also helps them show their creativity, which can motivate them to learn more. Schools should require students to complete student-designed projects during summer break. Â Â Â",

      "The policy of some schools requiring students to complete summer projects allows students to continue learning and challenging themselves academically when school is out of session. In order to encourage students to develop their creative and organizational skills, these summer projects should be designed by the students themselves. With the freedom of designing their own projects, students are also better able explore their own intellectual interests.\n \n Students must apply their creative skills when they are given autonomy in designing their assignments. My past history teacher assigned a project in which students were to select any event in history and present it through any medium. The students used creativity in crafting dioramas, drawing on large posters, constructing websites, and even conveying information through theatrical performances. The grading structure was based on how much effort was apparently put into each project, and this motivated students to work hard and make their projects unique. Students have the liberty and incentive to express their interests creatively if they design their own projects.\n \n Students can hone their organizational skills by structuring a project without a teacher's strict guidelines. Although guidelines are arguably necessary to any graded assignment, a teacher should create guidelines based on creativity and display of knowledge rather than conformity. In a student-based project, organizational skills beneficial to academic success are engaged, such as deciding on a main idea, providing evidence and examples, using pictures or diagrams for clarity, and practicing presentation techniques. In math class last year, I was assigned a project in which the only requirement was to explain a mathematical concept. Despite not having any background knowledge about website creation, I decided to make a website. I learned how to insert links and tabs dedicated to different mathematical topics. This experience taught me how to organize information into digital form. The ability to independently design an assignment is educational in that it develops students' ability to organize information in a clear, methodical way.\n \n Students will have the freedom to learn about and pursue their interests if they design their own projects. A teacher might have to restrict a project to a specific theme or subject, such as Medieval Europe. However, providing students some flexibility within a subject to work on the aspect that they feel most passionate about will lead to more enthusiasm. For example, my ecology teacher assigned students a research project on biomes. I was extremely curious about the tundraÂ but less so about the grasslands. Unfortunately, I had to research the grasslandsÂ instead of the tundra. I was largely apathetic about the subject, and although I learned some new facts, I believe doing a project on the tundra would have been a more educational experience for me. A student-designed project allows students to nurture their curiosity while completing academic work.\n \n By allowing students to design their own projects, students are less restricted by guidelines and are thus further enabled to develop their creative and organizational skills. Students are also able to learn about subjects that they already find interesting and worthy of further research, and will therefore be more enthusiastic about the assignment.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â",

      "Have you ever found yourself being bored when doing a project? Have you found it pointless because you get the horrible feeling that you are not learning? It could be because it was designed by your teacher. Many schools, but not all, require students to complete summer projects in order to get them ready for the upcoming information in those upcoming classes. Many of those projects are teacher designed which various students tend to dislike because of the singular, required format. For example, many projects require students to only draw pictures, only write essays, or only build structures related to the certain topic. Many of these students tend to lack the motivation to complete those tasks because they feel uncomfortable doing an action they are inexperienced with. Even though teacher designed summer projects tend to broaden the student's skills by giving them tasks they are somewhat uncomfortable with, it is better for projects to be student designed so students can strengthen their confident skills, learn at their own pace, and have fun while efficiently studying the topic.\n \n Student designed projects give students the choice to pick a format they feel comfortable with. This choice gives the student confidence in their ability to complete the project and strengthens a particular skill in use. For example, Generic_Name, my niece, decided to do drawings for her summer reading project last year. She would say that drawing her own version of the characters from her favorite book,\n \n Diary of the Wimpy Kid , would helped her visualize the story in her own way so she could visualize effectively when reading books without pictures to guide her. When she completed her task, she felt so confident in her work and even said, \"I'm going to do so good on this project. I know my teacher is going to love it.\" Because of this, it was noticeable that she obviously felt confident in her outstanding drawings. She even became a better drawer from it. She turned in her project and got an astounding grade on it. Overall, the experience she had with the project was very rewarding for her because she got a chance to showcase her confident drawings and had the productive opportunity to build on the skill she loved.\n \n Student designed summer projects give students the ability to learn at their own pace while ultimately having fun. For example, two years ago, my former World History teacher, Mr Generic_Name, had us do a project over the summer about the most important events in world history. Fortunately, he gave the opportunity to choose our own format for the project. Luckily for my friend Generic_Name, he decided to complete the project in the form of a song, considering he was very musically talented. Over the summer he would plan when to work on it that best fit his schedule so he wouldn't be stressed to finish the song. He researched about the effects of World War II and finished his song in no time. He stated that it was one of the best projects he had ever completed because for the first time, he felt like he actually learned something while doing an activity that he loved and had fun with. This clearly shows the effects of giving students a choice in designing their own projects for the best learning experience.\n \n Some may argue that teacher designed summer projects give students a chance to broaden and strengthen skills students are uncomfortable with, however, students don't learn that way. For example, this year in my AP Economics class, a peer of mine, Generic_Name, said she didn't understand the point of the summer project, which was to pick a book about economics, she chose the book\n \n Freakonmics , and write an essay on how economic concepts apply to everyday life. This is also considering that essay writing is not her specialty. She loudly complained about how boring the project was and how it was extremely time consuming. She even stated she got nothing out of it. Because she didn't have fun, she didn't learn anything and was furious by this outcome. This undoubtedly shows that teacher designed projects make students feel like they don't learn anything and overall, make them feel bitter about the subject.\n \n Overall, teacher designed projects don't give the students an efficient way of learning. Some students may find the project uninteresting and because of this, they may not learn the helpful information needed to help them with their classes. However, if teachers do include this option to student within the projects, it could give students the possibility of having fun and actually learning while they are strengthening skills they feel confident in. All teachers want is for their students to learn in an efficient manner in order to succeed, but that outcome won't be possible if teachers give out projects that don't include student decision making. If teachers want to achieve this outcome, they should give student different options to format their project in order for them to learn in the most efficient way so they can ultimately succeed academically and in the future.",

      "Summer projects are a way for students to continue their acedemic carrer over the summer. Some believe that these projects should be desinged by students to offer freedom exploration, but teacher desinged projects give structure, regulatoin ,and garuntee if students are learning.\n \n One of the best things a teacher desinged project brings is structure. A study from The Universty of South Virgina states that students are three times as likly to do work if its in a structured enviorment. Because students are not in school they lack structure to motivate them to do work, but if there project has a set of guide lines to follow it would make students more likely to do the assingend work.\n \n The teacher designed project would offer a rubric for students to follow. Research from The Old Zealand Education Department found that rubrics give students guidance for learning the matireal they are required to learn. With a rubric to follow there would be a way to regulate stundents to make sure they are learning what they need. Allowing the teacher to determine the progress of each student.\n \n Even with this evidence some believe that having student designed projects are the better choice, because it gives feedom for students to explore interests. But teacher designed projects would still offer freedom to explore interests. With a teacher disigned project a teacher can set standards for what skills students need to learn from the project, but students would still have the freedom to chose what topic they would study. Giving students the fredom to explore interests but still learn the skills they need.\n \n With the evidnece provided it is clear that teacher disgned projects are the best way for students to continue their learning over the summer. Giving them an advantage for the next school year to be at their best.Â",

    essay:
      "Do students know that there are schools debating on whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects are required by some schools to help ensure student's continue learning in the summer. Through evaluating the different arguments, student-designed summer projects are more beneficial compared to teacher-designed ones because it allows students to chose topics they are interested in and have the freedom to creatively complete the summer project; therefore,students are learning through their summer break.\n \n Having student-designed projects will allow students to chose topics they are interested in, which would captivate and motivate the students to want to complete the summer project. During the summer, many students don't find motivation to do any school work until last minute,in order to ensure they are spending a fun summer vacation. If summer projects allowed to the students to chose topics that interest them, it would help motivate them because the topic is something they like or are curious about. Consequently, students won't want to do a project on something that is boring to them because it leads the students make one of the following decisions: do the project last minute and put minimal effort or not complete the project at all. Summer projects are to ensure that students continue learning over their break; however, students won't be learning when they decide the project is uninteresting, then proceed to make the decision to put minimal effort into the project or not complete the project at all. So, are the students really learning at the end of the day? Putting minimal effort won't challenge or ensure the students are learning and neither is not completing the project. With all this in mind, student-designed projects would help with these issues. For instance, if a student has to complete a summer project about the American Revolution, but the American Civil War is what really interests them with a passion, wouldn't it be beneficial for the student and the teacher, for the student to do the project on the American Civil War because the project would be done at the student's best abilities? When students have the liberty to chose their own projects, like topics as it was discussed previously, this motivates and captivates the student's attention and want to complete the project; therefore, the students are learning over the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects allows the students to have the freedom to be creative and complete the project in a way they chose. Having creative freedom will cause the students to find the summer projects fun and will want to complete them. Additionally, when students can challenge themselves through this process because sometimes they will use new resources or try something new when completing their summer projects. For instance, if a student has to do a project on an assigned book for their English class, the student can decide to produce a video or create an infrographic, instead of a boring, old PowerPoint. The students can learn through this process because they are putting effort into the projects and making them more appealing to the teachers as well as other students, if they have to present. Moreover, students will have fun completing this project, helping ensure that the students will complete the project with lots of effort put into it, which leads to the students learning and students enjoying the process. During the student's summer break, they often tend to try and find school boring during it; however, the creative freedom given to accomplish their summer projects helps motivate them to complete them.\n \n On the other hard, others say that summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know best and create an expectation forÂ their students, which is partly true, however, not always. This is flawed in some ways because the projects that are teacher-designed are often categorized as boring because the students freedoms are often limited and don't show their full potential. If students had the ability to show their full potential in completing the project, the teachers will know exactly where they stand educationally in that subject. Another argument for teacher-designed projects is that it is easier on the teacher's side to grade the projects and create a rubric when assessing students. However, this is not a good argument since the teacher's job is to grade and making a rubric for student-designed projects shouldn't be that difficult. For example, if a student does a well produced video on Africa for their geography class with special effects and music that includes accurate information and meet teacher's basic requirements, that is much better than a boring PowerPoint; and the student was continue to learn during the summer about Africa and how to produce a video. In addition, to be reminded, summer projects are to ensure that students are learning during their break; however, with teacher-designed projects,that can never fully be ensured when many students barely put any effort in them or not do it at all. Therefore, teacher-designed projects ,majority of the time, have limited freedom for students and cause students to become uninterested in doing them, so they are not learning.\n \n Summer projects should be fun for the students, so student-designed projects allows the students to freely do as they chose with the project and have fun with it. During the summer, students don't find motivation to do any school work as they are exhausted by the finished school year; however, if the summer projects were fun for them, students will find motivation to complete them and put effort into them. As mentioned before, students will not perform good on their summer projects if they are boring, which is commonly found in teacher-designed projects. Furthermore, student-designed projects helps ensure the students ability to learn in the summer; that being the goal of summer projects.Â",

      "Are projects over the summer in fact needed for do they just cause misery for students?\n \n More commonly now in high school, teachers assign projects to students over the summer. These projects are called \"summer projects.\" The projects are given to the students to retain and expand upon their learning over the summer. Teachers are the force behind the projects with no saying coming from the students; however, this is how it should be. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it provides for the students to be prepared for the next school year and continues the development of the brain.\n \n Summer projects are given to make sure that students are ready for the year ahead of them. Teachers always have to follow the curriculumÂ with their teaching and assignments, meaning that they will always give what is needed to the students. If a student is partaking in a difficult class their next school year, teachers will commonly assign a summer project. This summer project will follow exactly what the curriculum says is necessary. In doing this, the teacher is giving exactly what the student needs to be prepared for the next school year. This past summer, I was given an optional summer assignment that was given to all students going into pre-calculus. The assignment was thought up and provided by a teacher that knows what the course entails. This summer assignment, that I completed, gave me the proper ingredients to be prepared for the year of the class ahead of me. I am glad now that I finished that project, because the teacher that designed it knew exactly what I needed to know in order to succeed in the class.\n \n The human brain continues to develop until the age of twenty five, and it is important to sustain this growth throughout that time with proper projects provided by teachers. At age twenty five, the human brain finally stops developing and it becomes more difficult for it to learn and adapt to it's surroundings. This is why it is vital to take great care of and continuously develop the brain in the right way throughout these years. With teacher-designed summer projects it is certain that the brain will nurtured and brought up the right academic way. Teachers assign material that is important to know as a developing young adult. These teachers commonly also have experience from their years of teaching and know in what way students should be brought up in order to be successful. With the correct teacher designed summer project students are properly developed in order to achieve their goals, however if designed by the students themselves, this caring thought will not be in mind.\n \n Students can't be left to be independent in these important projects. Although there is the idea that it is important for students to also develop individually in moments instead of a curriculum based way, this is not true for summer projects. Students don't fully know what the next course entails; whereas, teachers do know. Students can create projects that do not allow for them to be prepared for the year, or projects that cover the wrong part of their next course. This individuality also creates a divide in the knowledge of the students entering their next year, creating a difficult circumstance for the teacher of said class. With the divide in knowledge the teacher would have to compensate and reteach certain parts that should have already been covered and reviewed in the summer project. Overall, this student individuality creates many causes in concern over whetherÂ the student is ready for their year of a difficult class.\n \n Teachers should design summer projects because it ensures the preparedness of the students and continues the vital development of the young brain in the right direction. Teachers follow the curriculum, and will do the same in their assigned summer projects. This curriculum based activity is exactly what students need to be prepared for their classes. These teacher based assignments also make sure that the brain, which isn't fully developed until the age of twenty five is properly brought up. This brain developed is important to bring up a well rounded academic young adult. Moreover, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is what students need.",

    essay:
      "Many students dread their summer projects and procrastinate what is intended to be a three month long project or book till mere hours before the bell rings on their first day back. However, the stereotypical teenager angst that resents the idea of summer homework can be sternly challenged due to the great benefit for students working their brains during their time off. Some say that summer projects would be more enjoyable and valuable to students if they were designed by their peers instead of teachers. I disagree and believe that the teacher of a particular course can give the best synopsis to their class and set straight the expectations and course loadÂ through the summer assignment. Summer projects are a great tool to keep students' brains stimulated over the break, and they should be teacher designed in order to provide students with a strong background on a topic that will be further discussed during the school year, help to prepare students for the style of a teacher that they may be unfamiliar with, and allows the student to view a glimpse of the rigor and expectations that accompany a particular course.\n \n Summer projects are beneficial when they provide the opportunity for the student to learn more about a topic that will be discussed in their class during the year. It is essential that the students are given the opportunity to establish a strong framework that they can later build on with the help of their peers and teachers. Because this background is so vitally important I believe that it is the most beneficial for the summer project that will guide the student on their quest for more knowledge is designed by the teacher who knows exactly what topics will be covered in their class and what would be in the utmost importance to get an early understanding on. During the summer before Freshmen year my English class required a summer assignment on the Odyssey be completed. At first I was bummed out because I did not want to spend my summer doing homework, however it proved to be wildly beneficial and I enjoyed it. The summer assignment was designed by my English teacher and asked us the look more into specific characters and stories that she knew we would have a test on shortly after returning to school. Because the I completedÂ the assignment that my teacher crafted with care, I was beyond prepared for our test on the Odyssey and all in class discussions on the matter.\n \n Teachers even within the same discipline can have drastically different teaching styles, which is another reason why I believe that summer assignments should be curated by the teacher. A summer assignment made by that teacher should provide a glimpse into that particular teacher's style and allows the student to see early on what their new teacher places emphasis on while grading. During a student's schooling career it is unlikely that they will ever encounter a teacher whos style is identical to another teacher that they have had which is why it is of the utmost importance that students are allowed the opportunity to get to know their knew teacher and what the teacher will expect of their class before they even step foot in their classroom. For example my Freshmen and Sophomore year history teachers both were amazing history teachers but my individual learning preferences meshed much better with one of them. The different styles of teaching work better for different students depending on how they best learn, but it is important for the student to get a glimpse of their new teacher through the summer assignment.\n \n Summer assignments should also reflect the rigor of their corresponding course while setting forth the expectations that the teacher will have for their students in the class. Students gaining a general idea on how hard a particular class will be is extremely valuable if done so over the summer because then that allows for time at the beginning of the school year for the student to potentially switch to a different difficulty level if so desired. Because the summer assignment could potentially determine if the student drops the class to move levels it is integralÂ that the assignment be as class to the demand and standard of the actual class as possible. For this reason I believe that the teacher would be able to give the student a better accurate impression of the rigor of their class than a fellow student could give their peer. For example a summer assignment for AP U.S. History would be a great way for the teacher to open their future students horizon on the course and give an idea on how much homework that should be expected, the requirements for analyticalÂ pieces of writing like a data based question, and the overall expectations of the class.\n \n Summer assignments are a great way to get students' brains moving over the long break and can be beneficial in many different ways. These benefits like increased background knowledge and exposure to new teaching styles are hinged upon weather or not the assignment is made by students or teachers. Summer assignments should be teacher designed because it shows the student the rigor of the course, enables students to gain a strong background on subjects that will be discussed during the year, and helps to expose students to the style of their new teacher.",

      "Summer Projects\n \n Summer, one of the greatest times in a high school students life. A chance to take a break from school and sit back and relax in the warm summer heat. There are many ways teachers try to find a way for students to be able to keep up some of the things they learned during the break, one of the ways is assigning projects, should these projects be teacher designed or student designed? In my opinion they should be student designed. There are many reasons why but there are three reasons that really stand out to me .Students will find a fun and inspiring way to make a project, students also know what its like to be a teenager in the summer and not only doing the project but designing the project will help the student learn.\n \n Firstly, students know what it's like to be a teenager in the summer. Just the thought of the warm sun, cool water and late nights gives me chills down my spine. Just the idea of summer gives everyone a light happy feeling in their stomachs. Summer is a time for freedom, and many students hate the idea of the freedom taken away by a project a teacher gave them, which makes them not want to do that project at all. If students were to make the project they would think about what they do in the summer and how the summer makes them feel. They would most likely design a project that kids would do because they have an idea of an teenage life in the summer.\n \n Secondly, Designing the project will also be beneficial for the students to learn. They will learn how to design something and also, while designing the project they will learn more about the information inside the project. The students that usually do better in classes are ones that when they get it and understand what to do, they then teach it to someone else in the class that is struggling on it more. That is basically the same concept for students giving the ability to design this summer project.\n \n Lastly, in my opinion I believe students are more creative than teachers, especially when they are given a teachers task. I believe that when designing the project, the students will make the project fun and inspiring along with educational. I believe that students will make a project so fun an interesting that in the summer when kids sit down and do their project they won't even realize they are doing an project. Earlier this year my teacher gave my class a project over Christmas break that students made the year before. She also gave us a project for over Thanksgiving break that she made. The difference between the two projects was unbelievable. The one over Christmas break I actually wanted to do, while the one over Thanksgiving break I did not want to do at all. The one over Christmas break was fun and I actually did that one to my full abilities, and learned quite a bit doing it . Other than the one over Thanksgiving break where I just half did it and barley learned anything. I also saw a diffrence of people turning in their project. The one over Christmas a majority of the class did it, while the one over Thanksgiving break just a few people did it.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that students designing the project over the summer will cause more productivity in the projects getting done, more students will keep up their education in the summer and students who get to design the project will learn so much just from designing it.",

      'Summer break, the most favored break out of them all, mainly because, it is the most extensive break of the school year, and there are a lot of activities to do, and places to see over the long summer break which everyone enjoys. Summer break is also a good way to forget about all the stressful things that happened during the school year, like having a lot of homework, and not being able to complete it on time, and other things. Over summer though, there is no homework, so nobody has to worry or stress about having to do it. However, some schools actually do give out homework over summer in the form of projects, and the reason for this is so students can continue learning even over their summer break, but should these projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Well, most projects during the school year are teacher designed already, but over summer they should probably be student-designed projects and the reason why is because, students can actually do something they are interested in for the project and not something that they most likely do not want to do.\n \n First of all, summer projects are a good way of ensuring that the students do learn something, but a student-designed project would ensure that the student would learn something that they would actually be interested in, too many times in school students are pushed to do something, and learn something, that they dont have any interest in. If the projects were student-designed, students might even want to do them over the summer. For example, if a student had to do a summer project that was a student-designed project for history class, and this student was heavily passionate about taking photos, they could do a picture collage of all the historical sites they visited over the summer, the student does what they are passionate about like taking photos, and the teacher gets his historical project or a project of any subject for that matter. Student-designed projects offer more choices on how to do the project than teacher-designed projects, they also offer more freedom and this is good because then the students will enjoy the project and get a good grade out of it rather than doing something they consider as "boring" or "not fun", and most importantly they will learn things during their break which is the whole purpose of summer projects whether they are student-designed or teacher-designed.\n \n Secondly, Though some may argue that with teacher-designedÂ projects, students will learn more and will actually do their project, it can also be argued that the students will learn either way, with any method, in fact students might even retain the things they learned better with the student-designed projects, than with the teacher designed-projects because they did something they were actually interested in. Also, since they are doing something that they want and not something that they need to do for the project, the student-designed projects are more likely to have students successfully complete them rather than the teacher-designed projects, though in both cases they might have the same amount of students who actually complete them, since the students know that it is for a grade. Another benefit of the student-designed option, is that they are less stressful since the students get a say in their projects, and they will have more options to chose from with what they want to do for that specific project. Student-designed projects are beneficial to both the student, and the teacher, and while the same can be said about teacher-desgined projects, the students would memorize and maybe even learn more things with student-designed projects, and it could also be a more fun and less stressful way of doing a project and learning.\n \n In conclusion, I stand by my opinion that students that have projects over summer break, should have student-designed projects rather than teacher-desgined projects because, the students can learn something they want to learn, in contrast to learning things that they arent interested in, and though most of that information is vital and nessecary to the student\'s future lives, there are better ways to ensure they learn those nessecary skills, and student-designed projects are one of those ways. I believe that those student-designed projects will lead to students achiving a better grade in class, learning the vital school information, and learn something that they desire to learn.',

Some people disagree with the idea of summer projects being teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows creativity, benefits the teacher, and students are more likely to do it.\n \n When students are able to design their own projects, students get to be as creative as they want.

      "Throughout the school year, students are overwhelmed with mandatory classes and time-consuming activities. Today's students are more stressed than ever as they tried to keep up with their advanced classes and heavy workload. This often leaves students having to pick between their extracurricular and their school work, leaving them very little time to just be kids. Summer gives students the opportunity to relax and enjoy the world, but for many students summer assignments interfere. Allowing students to design their own summer assignments enables them to learn about something they are interested in all while continuing to emphasize the importance of learning in their daily lives.\n \n Students are given very little opportunity to take classes that appeal to them or that will benefit them in their future careers. Most high schools have a certain number of mandatory classes that must be taken to graduate and grant students only one or two electives. Giving students the ability to pick their own summer project lets them get the chance to explore a topic of their interest. A self-chosen project would feel less like a stressful job and more of an adventure. This would evoke passion in students and teachers will see better work in return. Additionally, students should not be limited to pick between certain topics, they should be able to choose anything from science to sports, and anll that falls inbetween. Introducing their own passions through a student-selected activity may even bring the joy of learning back after a school year full of stress.\n \n Schools often placed students in a box and present them with one way to learn. Standardize tests and their GPA start to define kids and throughout the school year, kids begin to loose interest in school and count down the days till summer. There is love of learning has been abandoned and each class drags on. Schools have the responsibility to engage their students and prepare them for life, a student-chosen summer project is a step in that direction. Schools that have started this have seen increased participation in the summer projects and more students are willing to learn throughout the school year.\n \n Consequently, schools must maintain some rules for their summer projects. Education is the most powerful tool a person can have and should be treated with such importance. Learning should be incorporated into your everyday and should not be placed on the back-burner during summer break. Schools must enforce a level of complexity to the project to ensure that the projects are of equal effort. For example, a student can not call watching television their passion. It is important to acknowledge all types of interests but giving students free range on a summer assignment could result in laziness or incomplete work. However, students who treat this project as a last minute event is more of a reflection on the student than the project itself. Nevertheless, schools must present some authority in assigning the project while still maintaining the idea of enabling students to explore their interests.\n \n Allowing students to select their own summer project is both beneficial to the students and the school. Teachers have all year to assign their own projects and summer is the perfect time for it be the students turn to explore their own passions and learn about an unknown topic. Although, initially schools will have to place some rules on the project the opportunity to bring the joys of learning back to kids is something that can not be pass up.Â",

My third opinion is if the students designs they're own summer project they might pick a project that might not help them. The summer projects should be design from a teacher not a student because the students won't know what their doing.\n \n The first reason why is because, Teachers has been working with they're students all year long.

This way the students won't have the same problems next year.\n \n The second reason why is because, Teacher will already know what to do. Teachers has been assigning projects for years, They will know what project will benefit his/hers students. If a student designs the project it might not benefit most students or it might not make any sense for other students.

      "Have you ever received the most boring Summer assignment from a teacher and waited till the last week to do it? Many would answer yes. Summer projects are designed to allow for a child to continue to grow cognitively, while away from a continuous study at school. However, many fail to consider that kids are still on Summer break, resulting in fun activities rather than working on a project due 3 months away. In order for Summer projects to succeed, they should be student-designed to ensure engagement within the project, allow them to grow in a field of interest, and give the students an opportunity to express themselves.\n \n Keeping students engaged in a Summer project is critical to the success of the assignments. A studentÂ is more likely to spend more time on a project that they are interest in, rather than completing required tasks that they don't want to do. Enacting student-designed projects allows for them to voice what they are likely to do that will keep them engaged in a learning activity. This allows the students to feel control over their Summer, and how they may want to incorporate learning into a fun growing experience. While they may voice their thoughts, they will also have a better understanding on what exactly to do for their project ahead of time keeping them engaged in whatever they need to accomplish. Providing a platform for students to express their ideas, leads to engagement and a product that succeeds the purpose.\n \n For many students, their engagement in an activity comes from the topic, allowing them to have freedom as to what they create, helps them further their mind. This also allows for fun because they are more engaged based on their topic choice. Many people say that they are prone to doing better on an assignment involving a topic of interest because they care more about the product. Student's who care about a topic will give you a product that means something to them, expressing their creativity and effort that they put into an assignment. Lastly, these projects are designed to cognitively grow and maintain a child's mind over break. Learning about themselves is one of the most important ways of doing that; by allowing them to design their own project and have freedom as to what they want to do, you are allowing an opportunity for them to find out what they are interested in and understand more about themselves.\n \n Finally, Summer is defined in a kid's mind to be a time of enjoyment and relaxation after a dwelling school year. With these Summer projects they should be associated with a similar thought. Student's designing their own project will allow for a creative outlook and give them an opportunity to create a better project than a poster board. Creativity proves to be effective in allowing for more growth than ever about how you may want to present what you learned over a break. Also when allowing a student to express creativity you are creating opportunity for them to incorporate something unique into their assignment which will further their engagement and growth.\n \n In all, Summer projects would be more effective and beneficial to student's if they were designed by student's themselves based on an increase of interest, opportunity to grow in a field of interest, and ability to incorporate a personable and creative outlook. Student's will feel empowered and confident in their assignment by self-designing an opportunity to grow themselves. Overall the result and product will be more detailed and purposeful when engaging a student in something they enjoy while allowing growth in their self as well as their minds.Â",

    essay:
      "Every summer, many students are sent home with work to to over their summer break. Not only are these projects often very labor intensive, but they are also put together by teachers, The students don't have a say in the formation of the projects. These summer projects should be designed by the students themselves because they know their brains better that anybody else, they will be more likely to complete something that they put together, and summer is supposed to be a relaxing time, so easygoing projects that are student-made could help keep students away from stress in the summer.\n \n Every student learns differently, so designing a project to fit their needs and their learning style would not only help them complete the project, but it would also help students learn more. For example, if one student in a class is a visual learner, and the other is an auditory learner, the visual learner will have an advantage on a project that is assigned ever summer and made out of poster board and pictures. This will also cause the visual learner to obtain information on the project more easily, while the auditory learner could gradually fall behind in school every summer. Even if a teacher took a poll to see what kind of learner each student thought themselves to be, there would not be one learning type that would be unanimous throughout a classroom or a school. This is a major obstacle that comes with distributing the same teacher-designed project to every student as a summer assignment.\n \n There are very few students around the globe who enjoy doing homework given to them by their teachers, but what if the students were the architects behind the masterpieces of homework and projects? Students, knowing that they put the powerpoint, poster, or worksheet together, might be more than motivated to complete the assignment. People may argue that a student being able to design their own assignment might not work out beautifully because they may know things that are usually not given to them on a normal worksheet. However, students will quickly realize that what is easiest for them is not enough, and they will need to challenge themselves throughout these assignments to make sure that they are ready for the school year that is to come. Also, students would not be given free reign to do anything that they please, teachers would provide guidelines and rubrics to make sure that students are incorporating the correct information and at the right difficulty.\n \n Every student looks forward to summer as a time to take a break from school, have fun with their family and other companions, and to simply relax. Assigning rugged and stressful projects for students to complete over their few months of relaxation could result in building stress and anxiety, which can lead to depression and things much worse. If students were to design their own projects and know exactly what they need to do and when they need to do it, they may not need to stress a great deal about the amount of time they have and about how much it will take away from their summer. This will ensure that high school students are still being high schoolers and having fun with friends and family. Some teachers could argue that they will stress about any project that they are assinged, but they have to understand that students know what they enjoy doing, and what they do not enjoy doing. Therefore, students could tailor their projects to be fun and stress free.\n \n Students should be allowed to be the lead architect on the glorious building that is their summer assignment in order to make sure that they are completing work that keeps them away from stress and learning in the way that their brain knows how to learn. If students were able to design their own summer projects, a mass change in the way scholars learn could be coming, and it would be for the better.",

      "With long breaks, students tend to forget important information they've learned throughout the school year. Summer projects are required for some schools to keep the student's brain on track during the long break. But, what nobody thinks about is, who should design these projects? More over, Should teachers or students design these projects? Many people argue summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed; however, no one thinks about a student/teacher-designed project.\n \n Projects made by students and teachers can cover the relevant topics with creative ideas such as: phone projects, video game projects, and sports projects. This can create diversity amoungst all projects and help the student haveÂ an exciting experience. Now-in-days Students spend their daily lives on their phones, assigning a project on their phones would make it easier for the student to navigate and be comfortable with the environment their in. For example, a teacher could create a class account on social media and post or request projects during the summer, and because students are always on their phone, they should be able to complete the projects assigned. Motivating a student to stay on track can be quite difficult if the material is boring or uninteresting. A student and teacher collaboration can grasp both sides of the spectrum and pull thoughts, ideas, and examples and put them all in one to make a great project idea.\n \n Throughout my junior year in high school i've done many projects and essays in most of my classes and they've all been teacher-designed. The most freedom i've probably gotten is just picking which assigned topic i'd like to write about or do research on but thats pretty much it, I'm very limited. For example, in my second period my teacher assigns many essays on politics or current events. Not everyone is interested in those topics so some of the students my class dont take the time to research and just copy and paste information found on websites. This makes students lazy and in the end they dont learn anything, they only thing they've learned is a bad habit. A recommendation i could make to my teacher is have more variety, more options, or even maybe a topic more interesting to provide to his students.\n \n Another great teacher of mine, Generic_Name, has the most variety and is willing to work with a student. Although he assigns teacher-designed essays, we have the freedom to pick our topics and what we get to write about. He helps morph your ideas into complex thoughts to satisfy the writer and the rubric. Furthermore, helping the student to think deeper and be interested in doing their essay. The teacher having some flexibility allows the student to enjoy what they're doing and finish their task.\n \n All in all, students and teachers can be affected greatly if projects were student/teacher-designed. A collaboration between students and teachers can create a connection leading to a greater outcome and success. Teacher-designed projects can also create a stressful environment for the students, and allowing student ideas to flow into teacher-designed projects creates a healthy environment for students minds. Students and teachers can build off each otherÂ and have a great relationshipÂ because, \"\n \n great minds think alike .",

Students should be able to chose what they would like to do for their project.\n \n Students look forward to their summer break because they dont have to do anything. Well teachers want them to continue learning during their break. If the kids were able to choose what they want to do on the project, they would actually do it unlike if the teachers chose a boring project. Kids are embellish and like to do their own thing.\n \n Also they get a new teacher every year. Their new teacher could expect more than the old teacher or grade it differently.\n \n If the teacher chose the project, the students might not do it because its boring or lame. If the student chose what the project is about then it's easier for the teacher to grade it and the students would enjoy it more. All the students would have different projects so it could be like a science fair and they get to judge whose project is the best.\n \n Students throughÂ out all ages are creative.

Doing projects they get to chose may excite some students and make them want to do it. They could also do their project based off how their summer went.\n \n Kids love to be independent and cant wait to grow up.

      "Have you ever thought to yourself about how summer projects affect students? Some schools have started to require students to complete a summer project, Should the projects be student-led or teacher-led? The following reasons are why I believe summer projects should be student-led: It would allow the students to broaden their topic range, It would make sharing the projects more enjoyable, and It would allow students to reflect on their summer.\n \n Giving students the opportunity to choose the topic of their project would allow the students to talk about everything they did over the summer. This allows students to choose anything they did, from taking a peaceful vacation to skydiving over Generic_City. Students would be able to adventure and begin an amazing life that has so many roads to follow. Many students would benefit from the projects and would have many stories to tell.\n \n Another reason students would enjoy self-led projects is because giving the students freedom to share their projects with other classmates. Sharing the projects would give students many things to talk abou when they come back to school and see eachother. Students by sharing could teach new things about eachother such as what their hobbies are. With students sharing their projects it forms new bonds and create new friendships between many unlikely people. Sharing projects would bring people together more and overall be great for everyone, it gives students necessary life skills such as: public speaking, communication skills, and essentially confidence.\n \n Allowing students to conduct their projects would be beneficial to students becuase they would have time to sit down and think about all they did. The project itself isn't really about the actual project, It's about students thinking and knowing they made pretty awesome memories over the summer. The projects shouldn't be about school work such as math or a history project. It should be about the students and helping them do their best to live their young lives to the fullest. In the end the students would be out in the world making memories with people in their community, they would be making a difference in the world they could travel and help with disaster relief, students could make a change in this world and the next.\n \n While some people may say that teacher-led projects could be best. I believe they are wrong, Nothing could make student mental and physical health go up other than to actually give students the freedom to complete a project and show they made a difference over the summer. Making the difference wouldnt have to end when summer ends students could make changes year-round. In theory students starting to develop their own projects would lead to students just wanting to make a change and go adventure.Â",

      "Summer break is a time we enjoy cause get to spend more time with friends and family. Some people think that taking a break won't do them harm at but you maybe allowing others to get ahead of you in life. The time you have on a break should be spent wisely not goofing around. During summer kids tend to study less which in return lowers brain activity which is why the should have a summer project to keep them busy. This summer project should be chosen by the students of the class room.\n \n Teachers think students can't handle certain situation but who better to chose what the students can handle then them selfÂ for this project. When students are given the option to pick their project they will feel much more motivated to accomplish this assignment if they can choose what it is going to be about. This motivation will cause the students to work harder for their grade and strengthen the skills they already know or new ones need for this assignment. The students could come up with this summer project together so that everybody will feel equally involved want to do their best. The standard for the project should be high so be won't be able to show up with a barelyÂ worked on assignment and pass. This assignment or project should build on skills that have been used through out the class.\n \n When kids have summer projects they could use it as a opportunity to build on skills need for a future career or maybe not so strong at like time management or mathematics. This extra time spent on the project will result in a positive change in grades and thinking. The brain is like a muscle the more you work it the stronger it gets so just like a muscle the less exercise you give it the more softer and weaker it is. There is more to just improving your work ethic and increasing brain productivity when it come to doing projects over the summer. When a kid is working on a project they are less likely to do something that can get them involved in dangerous or life threaten events.\n \n When kids have less time to do things they will ultimately value their time more and start to make better decisions. This will lead to better planning in the future and time spent doing something productive. They will also start to think about how this summer project be able to help them in their future career options or college and branch out in try learning new skills to accomplish these task in life. When letting a teacher pick the summer project kids may not feel as motivated to do it or see it as stupid but, the teacher will strengthen their skills in that subject.\n \n The project will lead to a better use of time over summer for most kids. This assignment will keep the kids working on their skills. This may even help kids see this project in a better view of why they have to do this. Their summers will be ten times more productive then they were before. Learning is a key foundation in life ,and the more you learn the more likely your chances of being successful.",

      "Have you ever been assigned a project over a long break? Summer projects are a good way to continue the learning from the school year into the long break, but if not done right, it can lead to the students not trying or learning anything new. It's not very conventional, but if you are assigned the right thing, then it can be beneficial. I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because the projects should be beneficial to the individual student; not to a whole class that has different learning capacities. The students projects would be designed for specifically what they need clarification on from the previous school year. This should help the student gain knowledge of the project subject to help them succeed in the future school year. For example, if a student didn't understand human geography but was assigned a project in math, than it wouldn't help them gain knowledge for their upcoming school year; however, if a student didn't understand human geography and was assigned a human geography project, then it would help them succeed in the future. If the students designed their own summer projects then there would be a greater effect than the whole class doing the same subject project.\n \n Students tend to learn better when they're the creator of their project and subject guidelines. Personally, I tend to work better by myself, on a subject that I need to improve my knowledge on. This gives me motivation to learn the subject where I lack knowledge, to help benefit me for my upcoming tests or even class. I asked multiple other classmates about their stance on this, and they also agree that working on something you enjoy learning about while working alone is way more beneficial than a standard summer project. It could be argued that some students don't learn when they don't have guidelines. The weakness in that is if students are given the opportunity to design their own project, then they will be able to retain the information more easily.\n \n Allowing students to design their own summer projects would increase the creativity of the project. This would improve the experience of the student and the teacher. This improves the experience of the student because it allows them to learn and expand thier knowledge on something they like instead of a forced subject. In addition, this improves the experience for the teacher because they get to learn new things too. In addition, they won't be grading the same project for every individual person. Students that design their summer projects have the opportunity to captivate their teachers attention with an astonishing amount of information.\n \n Summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative. Summer projects should reflect a students knowledge on a subject, not forced work. The students projects would be designed for specifically what they need clarification on from the previous school year.

      "As a young girl summer projects had always taunted me. I've always hated that the summer projects were so hard that I can only answer 2 questions out of the 50 question packet. These packets made me feel like I wasn't smart enough , even thoughÂ they were there to help me. And the fact that if I were to complete the packet teachers wouldn't ask for it and that bugged me so much. Although some may believe otherwise struggling students , My friend's experience , and my own experience proves that summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n Struggling students proves that summer projects should be student-designed. Summer projects are here to help us and keep us learning .When a student struggles in that subject area where the project was given these students would struggle and then become discouraged to continue making them feel small. Student-designed summer projects would target the areas they struggle in to help them succeed. Some people may say that these type of students will still struggle with or without student-designed work . In some cases this may be the case but student designed work will target trouble factors but teacher-designed will through a whole curriculum at you.\n \n My friend's experience also proves that student-designed projects are the way to go. In the summer of 2019 my friend Generic_Name was given an Algebra 2 summer project packet to complete. Knowing that math isn't her strong suitÂ she still attempted the summer assignment. As she went along the packet the questions were getting harder and harder for her to complete. She had never seen questions like this before so she got discouraged. Out of 100 math questions she only completed 10. She was beaten. How was she as a junior to remember the math curriculum from freshman year. So she tried to use online resources to help her but she still couldn't understand. The packet was never completed. Some people may say she shouldv'e gotten a tutor, but not a lot of people can afford a tutor to help them.\n \n Lastly my own experience is why summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. As I said earlier teacher-designed packets made me feel like I wasn't smart enough and that they so hard that I can answer only 2 questions out of the 50 question packet. Teacher-designed packets are meant to introduce you to the curriculum for the upcoming year for that subject area. So that means harder problems. But student-designed packets are targeting problems areas and are helpful and designed to the student personally which means more understanding and helpful. Most of the time content that is understanding and shaped for that specific student's learning is what is best for them. I know that if a curriculum was shaped for me and how I learn I would understand that subject way better. Some people may say that its too much work to shape a curriculum based off how the student learns and that the student would need to learn to adapt to it .But if you were to do that grades and testing scores would rise because students are doing better.\n \n This is really important. Adapting the way students learn could possibly change ones future. In the past learning was state designed. They thought they knew the most effective way of a students way of learning but ended up hurting us. Student-designed summer assignments will help us grow in our education and succeed. We can start taking action now. Teachers can be more understanding and states should lookk to students to see how they could change the learning that fits to their students. After allÂ we are the future of America.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

Teachers should be the ones to design these summer projects because they are the ones who know what is going to help the students get prepared for the next school year.\n \n Teachers are much more responsible than their students which makes them better candidates for designing summer projects. Teachers are more mature than their students. Teachers know what the students are going to need for the future. Teachers would know what would be the best thing to do for their students. Teachers overall are best choice when debating weather or not they should be the ones to design summer projects.\n \n Some people may still argue that students should be the ones to create their own summer projects because of reasons like, \"It's their summer project, let them do what they want\", or, \"They should get to choose how they want to learn over the summer\".

If you got to pick who designed your summer projects who would you pick: teacher-designed or student-designed? Having student-designed projects is so unique and a great way to make projects more interesting. How about we switch it up a bit and instead of teachers creating the projects students do. Making summer projects student-designed would make it stress free on students, give them freedom, and it would make learning fun.\n \n I'm currently a high school student, so trust me I know how stressful school projects can be. If students designed these summer projects all the stress would go away. You would get to do the project on your own time and you'd get to pick what you want to learn about. Students wouldn't make the projects super hard or long because it is summer break and that's their time to relax. A teacher would normally give you a rubric or a set of guidelines you have to follow, but now you get to make it how you want.\n \n The possibilities are so endless if students got to build summer projects. You'd be able to pick how you want to do things and you could really bring out your creative side. It's the students break, this is when they don't want to think about school, so they should be able to decide whats best for them. You wouldn't have a list of things you need to follow you would be able to do whatever you wanted to. This would be such a great opportunity for students to enjoy learning and make it interesting.\n \n I know I've definitely gotten a topic to research about and it wasn't interesting to me at all. Having to do a project on something you find boring won't give you the motivation you'd need to push through it. If students got to pick what they wanted to learn, they wouldn't mind having these projects during summer break. Finding something to learn about that really interests you would make the experience as a whole ten times better. Maybe you're doing a poster on something you learned about in history, you get to enjoy learning about it and make that poster however you want to.\n \n Student-designed summer projects overall sound like something that would satisfy every student. Having teacher-designed projects would most likely be more organized and efficient, but students would have more fun and enjoy learning if it was student designed. Lets make learning over summer break something everyone would enjoy while also being able to relax.

      "The concepts our public schools come up with are great and efficient! Schools like to push their students to succeed and to be educated. For this reason, some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure that they retain the material and information they learned during the school year; furthermore, these projects should be teacher-designed. The best reasons that support this claim are that these projects are, in fact, beneficial to a students education as they help them retain information and will help students study, these projects can offer an opportunity for students to earn extra credit the next school year, and because a teacher will know a students academics strengths and weaknesses, a student will not.\n \n Extra credit is something a student may need to graduate, it is something universities look at, and it can bolster a students grade. These teacher-designed summer projects are a great concept to introduce into schools as one of the countless opportunities for students to excel and succeed. A summer project would be a project grade, a grade that can massively improve a students grade. Following after that, their GPA would increase do the positive grade. This is great for students, which is why it is the first reason as to why teachers should design the summer projects rather than students design them.\n \n Secondly, if projects are designed by teachers, they can help teachers understand where their students level of understanding is at. A student completing the project is more than a grade as a teacher can see where a students weaknesses and strengths are. If a teacher can find the material a student does and does not understand, they can reinforce and reteach the student the material in a way that suits the student better. If a student designed their own project, they would not know how to, as they would not know their own weaknesses and strengths as much as a teacher will, making teacher-designed projects during the summer much more efficient.\n \n Thirdly, teacher-designed projects will help students study and retain information; summer vacation is about 2-3 months long, students can forget important information during that time. A project that focuses on the core subject a student was learning will keep the material, information and concepts fresh in that students mind. This is crucial to do, as if the student is unprepared the next school year, they will fall far behind. If a student designed their project to help study, they would make it easier on themselves by not including the material they don't understand so they can learn it. Nobody can learn what they already know, which is why students should not design their own projects and why teachers should design their projects.\n \n However, that's not to say that even with teacher-designed projects there aren't faults. Even with studying and completing a project during the summer, a student can still forget the material. A student may know their own weaknesses and strengths and could be working on their weaknesses. And a teacher may make the decision to not grade the projects at all. That's also including that some teachers may actually tell students to make the project themselves as that allows the student to truly look at what makes the subject difficult for them, it allows the student to learn about the subject, and it helps the student to help the teacher understand what made the subject difficult for them.\n \n In conclusion, its best teachers design summer projects. While students can do it to and learn for themselves, a teacher is more skilled in this area of education and would help a student more than hinder them. A teacher giving extra credit, a project that challenges the student to help them retain the information, and a project that helps the teacher understand a students strengthsÂ and weaknesses is vital to a students success. Therefore, why shouldn't, wouldn't, or can't schools allow teachers to design summer projects for students?",

    essay:
      "The American school system is unfortunately still on the fall-late spring school schedule, leaving students their summer out of school. Although all students would likely agree that this off-time is beneficial, the majority of students experience a 'summer slide' where they lose knowlede they have gained in the past year, and get out of the habit of learning. As a remedy to this, especially in higher level grades, schools assign summer projects in order to help students maintain the mindset of learning. How these summer assignments should be designed is very important to how the students use their knowledge during their break. If students designed the project, they would likely find the projects more enjoyable, but risk not actually learning much in the process. On the other hand, teacher-designed assignments may cause students to lose interest and not work their hardest on their project. Therefore, I think that a teacher designed, but creative assignment, would be most beneficial to students' learning curve over the summer. By assigning something creative with educational merit, students would enjoy working during their free time, learn new things, and prevent losing knowledge they have gained while they are on their summer vacation.\n \n Having fun with assignments is an essential part in keeping young students interested in school, particularly when they are on a break. If a student is assigned something they find boring, they are less likely to try as hard as they would on a more creative assignment. Also, if the assignment is more open to interpretation, it helps students think more creatively. Students would be much more likely to complete, and better yet, enjoy assignments that they find creative and fun. Meanwhile, a student with a duller assingment would not put their entire effort into it, and would surely rather be enjoying their vacation. By making the assignment itself more enjoyable, students would be 10 times more interested and likely to enjoy it.\n \n Though the creativity of the assingment is paramount, the educational value of the assignment is just as important. By having teachers design summer projects, this assures that the students will gain or keep their educational mindset and knowledge throughout their summer vacation. It's important that teachers do the designing of the project in order to guarentee that students are actually learning something through completing this project. Teachers should, however, consider the input of students while they are designing it, in order to make it more enjoyable and interesting for them, not just a boring assignment.\n \n In order to make sure that students can actually enjoy their projects, leaving it open to some interpretation can help a diverse set of students come up with individual ideas for their assignment. This would make it more interesting for everyone involved, and would also prevent students from copying each others' work, as well as helping them nourish their creativeness while they are out of school.\n \n By making summer assignments creative, but still educational, teachers can prevent students from getting out of the educational mindset over their break, as well as help them enjoy their work as much as they enjoy their time out of school. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, but still have room for creative and original ideas that will help the students enjoy their work and their individuality as they complete their summer work.",

      "As the end of the school year approaches, I began to grow with excitement. Finally, I have a break from the stressful school work. However, as I thought I would be free from the chains, I am held back once again as teachers began to assign tedious summer project. Tired and with my strong desires of a break, I waited till the last couple weeks of summer before starting on the time consuming project.Â Recently, an argument has risen about whether summer projects should be student deigned or teacher designed. People who believe that the projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects would increase the percentage of participation on these projects. Others, who believed that it should be teacher designed, argue back that the knowledge teachers have on the curriculum allows the projects to be truly designed for its main intention.Â Teachers should be designing these summer project because of their knowledge of the future curriculum and their understandingÂ of the mindset of students.\n \n Teachers are well equipped with the knowledge of the future curriculum, thus they have the ability to adjust their lesson plans to help assist their students for the upcoming years. Seen by many students, lessons or skills learned in the previous school year are used in the present school year. For example, math facts, such as addition and subtraction, are constantly being referred to in all math courses. Acknowledging this reality, teachers would try to shift their lesson plans around for the purpose of trying to strengthen their students ability to understand such skills. Similar theory is applied to the designing of summer projects. Teachers, with the knowledge of what is expected in the next couple courses of a students life, would be able to shape projects into helping the students prepare for the upcoming school year.\n \n Teachers' understanding of the mindset of typical students causes the summer projects to be unbiased. People who believed that the summer projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects will encourage for more participation, due to the fact that these projects will have a more simple design and be more easier to understand. However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects.\n \n Having a easier summer project not only doesn't shift the percentage of participation, but also causes a strain in the development or knowledge of the student over the summer. Almost all teachers have witnessed students who refuse to complete homework, thus, they understand that lowering the difficulty would not change participation. This observation causes the teachers to not design the projects in favor of student's emotions, but rather design the projects according to the theory of helping their students.\n \n Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have understanding about future curriculum and understanding about the actions of a typical student. One of the main goals of a teacher is to assist students or help students succeed in life. Therefore, logically, everything a teacher does is to benefit the students. Teachers, unbiased about the emotions of a student, will challenge their students into achieving high goals. In their best efforts, teachers would try to assist their students in trying to acquire beneficial skills. Teachers understand that some students will try to challenge authority by refusing to complete assignment, instead of signing in defeat, they will persistent in their teaching methods because they understand that defeat wouldn't help the student. Thus, teachers should have the opportunity to design summer projects because they are guaranteed to have design projects that benefit students. Many successful businessmen, doctors, or scientists, credit their success to teachers. The profession of teachers have existed for many generations and have been known as the source of many successful people's success. Therefore, their ability to create a summer project should not be questioned.Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "There are many schools that require students to complete a summer project. Most of these projects are either student designed or teacher designed. However, these summer projects should be designed by students all of the time. The projects should be designed by students because they would show each students creativity and passion but also show their ability to work on something independently.\n \n First, the ability for students to design projects would allow them to express their creativity in unique ways. If each student designs a project there would be countless different creative and unique versions. For example, one student might make a movie for his project while another student creates a podcast. This creativity would not only make projects more interesting but students may also enjoy them more because of the creative freedom. On the other hand, if the project was teacher designed there would less variation and a lot of of the same boring and bland projects. Clearly, summer projects should be student designed so students can express their creativity.\n \n Secondly, if students designed their projects they would have the ability to do projects about something they're passionate about. If students did their projects on what they were interested in they would most likely do a lot better job and put more time into it. For example, a student who is interested in cars would put more effort into a project about cars rather than if a teacher assigned him a project about wildlife. In addition, this project about wildlife would probably end up not expressing creativity and lacking information because there would be no passion for the project. Also, the ability for a student to do research on a topic that interests them allows for them to learn about something that could be a potential career choice in the future. While researching a student may learn that the topic is not quite what they thought it was or may learn that it's something they wanna continue to gain more knowledge about and make a career of it one day. Obviously, summer projects should be student designed, so students can learn about their passions and be motivated to do a better job.\n \n Lastly, a student designed project would show their ability to work on something independently. If student designed more of the workload falls onto the student than the teacher. The ability to design and complete an entire project without any teacher help would take massive amounts of independent work skills. In addition, the ability to be independent is very important, and one day students will be out on their own without any teacher or adult to show them the way. This project has potential to teach students how to do things independently. However, if teacher designed the students would have everything laid out for them but that is nothing like the real world in, which a person will have to do everything on their own. All in all, the potential to learn how to do things independently is massive with a student designed project.\n \n Many schools have summer projects that must be completed over the break and some of these projects are teacher designed. Although, when teacher designed these projects lack creativity, interest from students, and independent work skills. Therefore, these summer projects should be student designed so that they are creative, interest the students, and teach students how work independently.Â Â",

    essay:
      "Imagine going to the last day of the school year. Imagine the fun summer that is waiting for the span of about two months. Now... imagine enjoying the last week of the summer vacation, but then realizing there is a summer project assigned by one of the classes due on the first day back. Following a teacher's directions while doing a school project can be difficult some times, especially when the teacher did not give their email/contact information regarding on the project. Therefore, who is going to help explain the instructions? Projects should be fun to do, not tedious based on teacher's instructions. So why let their minds go to waste as the years go by, when they can explore the world through a more interactive, more attractive kind of way? Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows a creative aspect in specific students' minds, it can help them stay on top of the assignment at hand while being interested, and it helps the teachers themselves by looking at different ones from different people and viewing the topic in different perspectives.\n \n Creativity is where the mind of most people take a different turn on certain topics. Creativity should not be kept in a box, it should be someplace else: a wall, a canvas, paper, books, music- everywhere and anywhere it can and should be, as long as it is not crammed inside; sitting there as the dust falls on the area, leaving it gray. Although some students may say that they are not creative, or not that innovative- but they most certainly are, they just need a small extra push in the right route. The reason why they are so negative on being creative is because that little part of the brain labeled 'creativity' is covered in dust. Their minds are plagued by the dust, and they are not reaching their full potential of creativity. Creativity is how a person views the world through their eyes; not through their friends' eyes, or through their parents, or school, it is through their own. It is imperative that students really take a try at being creative because it opens their eyes to a world full of other possibilities. They will see the world in all of its colorful splendor. Homework assignments, classwork... all boring assignments when the teachers give specific instructions on how to do them. Not very creative, and not that very thought-provoking either. It bores the class being swamped with regular assignments. But, when a group project comes around, why is that subject the only one being touched on through creativity? That, is very limiting. Every assignment should have an option; an option that can give a better grade on creativity than a normal, typed up/written assignment because it is important to not keep the creativity stuck inside the students' minds. All while they are touching up on their creativity, they are more invested at the task assigned to them.\n \n Investing time, is time consuming. To be fair, it is supposed to help others be more organized, or to be more punctual, but how? Sure, the teachers can say that it is going to help them continue learning throughout the summer- that is filled with fun plans along with enjoying time socializing with others, but everyone knows that they are going to do it either the first week of summer or the week before it is due. No in-between. Summer is supposed to be enjoying, not filled with dread and anxiety of a school project. But, if a little creativity is sprinkled through the instructions, then students will be a little less stressed and anxious about finishing the project because they are the ones who are making the rules and the guidelines of the task. That, is more eye-opening than paperwork that relatively looks similar to parents' taxes and bills. Adults always tell the 'young ones' to do something that interests them more. Sports? Whichever appeals to their eyes and their physique and how much they can take. How many times has someone asked, \"what do you like?\" Countless of times. How many times have they actually answered with a straightforward answer? Sometimes. Being interested on assignments are important, because this gives students more elbow room to work with than a structurally four-by-four square box with a pencil, eraser and paper. It helps them work with an open mind, it helps them stress less and turn in the project on the first day back, brimming with confidence. Creativity is to be shown to others, including the teachers who assigned the task over the summer.\n \n Classes can either be a very hands-on type of experience or a very claustrophobic one. Teachers are somewhat under appreciated. They are either too strict or they are just simply \"fun\" to hang around- they can be boring and monotone or they can be interesting and colorful. Everyone has been through a lot of teachers, but when have they ever been through a teacher who was strict, yet fun at the same time? Very few have. It is like\n \n Goldilocks , when she tries each porridge, each chair, then each bed. Those teachers make everything \"just right\" for students. When assignments come around, every teacher is staring at the same black and white sheets of paper, but if they were to look at different ones- different styles of writing, different colors used, different methods tackling the subject, they would not have to strain over Times New Roman font text or illegible handwriting. Overall, it benefits the teachers by showing how the students viewed the assignments and how effective it was when it was assigned.\n \n Finally, students should have their summer projects based from their own rules because it helps them focus more, it helps them take a break from the regular classwork, and it helps teachers have a refresher to look at. It benefits everyone in the long run. It gives a sense of accomplishment because they did well on the summer assignment. A good grade to start off the school year, along with a good, fresh mood to start the year off. Find a colorful, more creative way to start the year off.",

      "Numerous schools nationwide require students to complete projects over summer break. These summer assignments are primarily used to maintain learning and knowledge through summer. Furthermore, said projects are likely teacher-designed; an upright design flaw . If. instead, the projects were student designed; students would be engaged in democratic teamwork, they'd likely actually complete their assignment, and doing so would take stress off both the teachers and students' backs alike.\n \n Most of the time in school, students are simply told what to do, how to do it (or not do it), and then graded upon their achievement or failure. Most students are hardly given a say in anything they have to do. However, in a student designed summer project, they'd be given an opportunity to practice having a voice and opinion. All the students would grow closer to one another as they come up with the best idea; something that's missed out on with teacher designed projects. Not only would students be closer, but they'd get to collaberate as individuals working towards a common goal. This is something that is seen in governments, so it'd be great for students to get experience with collaberation. Student led design would also be majorly inclusive, since they all want the same thing (an easier assignment). Regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, etc, students all have the same willingness to get a better project idea together.\n \n A lot of students wait till the last minute to even do their summer assignments, if at all. Student designed projects would change that. If the project is designed by them, they'd have a much greater interest in the topics chosen. Interest is actually the primary motivating factor towards completion, according to Princeton's 2012 study. With greater interest, comes greater enjoyment. Nobody would really enjoy a project they were assigned, but if they were there for the whole process it would be much more enjoyable. Students even may feel an obligation to complete their projects to a more satisfactory level, or all the design work would've been for nothing.\n \n A huge problem in todays education system is the level of stress held by students and teachers. A student designed assignment would allow a lot of unnecissary stress to eliviate, though. Teachers wouldn't worry about if the projects good, over completetion, or the stress of creating a project in the first place. Students, on the other hand, would be given the power to know and create what they have to do, which will allow a much greater understanding of the project once they begin. This is especially true for students who may start their assignments later in the summer. If the assignment was designed by students, they would better retain the knowledge and understanding of what's required of them to do. Although student designed projects wouldn't get rid of all school related stress, it'd definetely be a step in the right direction.\n \n There are many things that can be adapted in our education system, but something as simple as this would have nothing but a positive impact on everyone. A student designed project can introduce students to teamwork and divergant / convergant thought, reduce on overall stress, and push students to complete their assignments. Students should lead the way, since in just a few years those student's will become our teachers, politicians, and scientists; all people who must design and push the bar higher. Â Â",

      "How do you feel about students summer being teacher designed or student designed? I agree that student projects should be designed by themselves. Students will be able to have there own creative project rather than, having the same thing as there friends. Students wouldn't think that other people are cheating from there projects.\n \n In my opinion, I agree that students summer projects should be student designed.\n \n Firstly, Students summer projects should be based on students designed because of the creativity of students.\n \n In this generation students have a lotÂ of creative ideas and that It can be use in there classwork. Students doing projects that are student designed will give students to think about what they will do instead of being outside and doing the wrong thing. For example, Generic_Name has a project that he has to do over the summer but, his teacher says that It has to be In her order and that it has to be plain. When Generic_Name gets home he decidedÂ to go outside with his friends. since Generic_Name cannot be creative on his project he will not start on It.\n \n Next, I think students wouldn't protect there project from other students anymore If they have to do there own creative project. It Is more than 45% of students cheat In the U.S today, students will have more trust in their peers around them If they be able to use their creative mind. For instance, Generic_Name and Generic_Name are doing there projects but Generic_Name walks out to use the bathroom, Generic_Name meanwhile gets up and take pictures of Generic_Name project because, he forgot how there teacher told them how to do It. Since Generic_Name forgot how to do the project he had to cheat.\n \n Furthermore, I agree that students summer projects should be students designed but, If the project the teacher gives out Is by there designed It can help In many different ways. Teachers will be able to have lesser work while checking these projects If they are by there own designed. Teachers will be able to grade In a short amount of time because If the student follows the directions, the teacher wouldn't have to be frustrated on the grade.\n \n Finally, students should be able to designed there projects rather than having your teacher deciding what to do.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "We as people get dumb, it's true, over a period of time we get dumber. To counter-act this problem schools started to assign projects over the summer to keep student learning. When I was in high school we had a huge summer break project, thankfully in my case it was a group project, but what was interesting is that our teacher asked if we, the students, design the project or if the teachers do. Some may believe that it would be better to let the students design these, but it's better if the teachers do because you will get good practice, you dont have to do work designing it, and it will help you in the future.\n \n One reason why teachers should design these summer projects is because you would get good practice. After a long break I sometimes have trouble getting the mindset ready to learn again, I often don't pay attention after a break because I am still in that kind of mind set. If teachers assign these projects, with their ideas, it would help me get ready for the school year. It is better for the teachers to design these instead of the students because they hand out good hard working projects, if students made these I fear they would make it too easy so they can get it over and done with.\n \n One other reason why teachers should design summer projects is because, well so they have to make it and we don't. I am going to be honest, nobody likes to do a summer project, they may be helpful but they are boring, so why should students waste more time designing the projects, then have to do the actual thing. It would be better for the teachers to make these so students don't waste more working time designing these. If teachers made the project then the students can give their full attention into completing it, not creating it. For example, when I had to do a summer project, I had the luxury of focusing only working on the project; while my friend, who goes to a different school, had to design their own. He told me that it was harder because he worked hard designing it and got really tired just from designing.\n \n One final reason why teachers should design summer projects is that it will help you in the long run. For me, I was one of the top workers because in my job they require you to work at all times, even during your breaks. Thanks to school, with my teacher giving me a summer project, since they designed the project, it was a good hard working one made my an adult. This helped me practice doing projects over breaks so I was able to do wellÂ in the future. Again, if students made this they would most likely make the projects easy. If students made things easy for themselves, it wont help them in the future. If their future job required them to work all the time, they would struggle at first because they made it too easy for themselves and their job would want them to do adult level work.\n \n Some might say that letting the students design summer projects is the right option; however, it is better to let the teachers make them because you would get good practice, you don't have to waste time designing the project, and it will help you in the future.",

      "Summer is what students look forward to every year. For most, there's no homework to worry about or any assignments/ projects to do. But, on the other hand, there are also some schools that require assigned projects during the summer for students so that they continue to learn during their break. For schools that do that, those summer projects should be student-designed and here's why.\n \n With having student-designed projects over the summer, it creates a balance so that students can both enjoy summer and so that they can also have enough time to do any work that needs to get done. For example, students go out and about their day by going to the pool or hanging out with their friends. But, once they get home they can spend those 20-30 minutes to complete parts of their project. That right there is the balance between summer and school. It should be able to fit/work for students. After all, these students do need a break and shouldn't be overwhelmed with work. It is their summer, they shouldn't be robbed out of it with a project.\n \n Now, some might say that during the summer they don't have enough time or that they're too busy with family to complete the whole project. And that's true, students are relatively busy over the summer with plans or vacations with family. So, it's understandable to think that some may not complete the whole project. For instance, a friend of mine travels to a different country every year over the whole summer. How would she be able to complete her project if it was teacher-designed? With making it student-designed it applies to students and how they'll manage their time to finish that project. Any student would be able to finish the student-designed project because, it won't be long. It'd be short but, enough so that students will still continue to learn enough from it.\n \n Let's say that these summer projects would be teacher-designed. The work load would not be fair for students. It would only apply to how the teachers would want and not the students. Teachers would expect them to finish that project regardless of the situation which isn't fair. Then, students would start to become stressed and overwhelmed because they don't have enough time to finish their work. Therefore, they can't enjoy their summer because all they'll end up doing is stressing instead of having fun. It won't be balanced enough for them to do both.\n \n In conclusion, these projects should be student-designed because in the end students are the ones who are doing them, not the teachers. Student-designed projects benefit both teachers and students in the long run. Teachers don't have that much to grade when they get back and they still educate their students at the same time. And as for students, they still have enough time to enjoy their summer and continue to learn at the same time because it was designed for them to.Â",

      "Should school summer projects be created by students or teachers?\n \n Imagine its the last day of school , everyone is excited to get out of school, but the teacher said there will be a summer project. Everyone would be upset and disapointed, but what if that teacher gave you a choice to create your own summer assignment? Although some people say summer assignments are more effective, actually summer assignments are more effective when created by students.\n \n Some people think summer assignments are better off in the hands of a teacher, because they believe teachers have more experience, and can provide the best preparation for the following year. For instance, you have a history teacher teaching world history, but towards the end of fourth quarter he gives you a large packet on US history to complete for a summer project. This shows that the specific teacher who was teaching world history, is trying to prepare the student the best he can, by providing him with a project with all the information he needs to know to succeed in a history class the following year.\n \n However, if students were given a choice to design their own summer projects, they would be able to work on topics they enjoy, which will change the mood on summer assignments forever. For instance, if a teacher decided to give summer assignments over the long break, she would give her students a big boring projects thats due in the fall. However, if that teacher gave the student a choice to create thier own project, it could be portrayed from their own personal interests, which would make the student much more excited to complete the project. Furthermore, if something interests you, you will be excited to do it, but if something is boring, than you are more likely to feel depressed about doing it, which would eventually lead to procrastination.\n \n On the other hand, if students were given a choice to create their own summer project, the rate of missing projects would decrease tremendously. For instance, a teacher gives everyone a project on world war one, but the people who enjoy wars and the event of world war one would do the project with excitement, while others would do it because they want good grades. However, if students created their own project, it would allow everyone the right to choose thier own topic. This would make everyone excited to do thier own project. This will also allow students to pick out thier particular interest, which will make them more likely to do the project leading to the downfall of missing assignments.\n \n Also, if students were given a choice to design their own summer project, it possibly could influence them and in the future they might consider going into a teaching major. For instance, if a student was designing a project, and had great interest in planning the project itself, it might give him an inspiration to become a teacher in the future. This not only will help the student plan his future, but it would also allow others to find their future as well. If all the students were allowed to plan their own summer project, there could be a possibility that at least one of the students enjoyed planning the project ultimately influencing them to become a teacher.\n \n In conclusion, students should have the choice to design their own summer projects, because of the benefits it provides. This would not only cause the rate of missing projects to decline, but it will also let students chose their topics for their projects, making the student excited to complete the assignment. It will also create a plan for students who enjoyed planning the project, ultimately influencing them to go into a teaching major.",

    essay:
      "Some school systems require hear students to finish projects over the summer. Simply to be sure that they are constantly learning and remaining information. This is a great idea, but how shouldÂ this be executed? Should the projects be teacher or student designed? Giving the student the ability to create their project would encourage them to explore more in depth or maybe even new interests. Along with this this it would force the student to be creative, an otherwise lacking skill in Virginia school systems. On the other hand, having the projects be teacher made would make them more easy to asses. The summer projects should be student designed because, it allows the student to pursue their own interest, also it makes the student be creative; adversely, having them be teacher made would allow for the teacher to much easier asses the student.\n \n First of all, having student made summer projects would help the students find what interest them. This is an important step in piecing together your future. Me personally, a junior in high school, has no idea what field of work best interests me. Exposing these young minds to as many topics as possible could significantly help them choose an occupation to peruse. Having them create their own projects would help them deeper explore,or understand their interests. Therefore, student created projects would help spark interest.\n \n Also, giving them the freedom to design their project would force them to be creative. School seems to suck all the creativity right out of its students. From the never ending notes to the standards set by the state. There seems to be no room for creativity, or individualism. It always seems to be bland and without color.\n \n We as a community forget that not everyone is a textbook kind ofÂ learner. There is a lot that factors into the psychology of learning and many forget that. Having projects more open ended and student designed would shed some of this pressure, and allow for the students to be creative and do their best work. Also creativity is extremely important. The earth is a never ending cycle of creation. Who will be the next Steve Jobs or maybe carry out an even bigger legacy. creativity sparks change, it makes us advance as the human race. In conclusion, giving the students the task of designing their summer projects will let them be creative.\n \n Lastly, letting the students design their projects would make it harder for the teacher to asses the student. This is important to the teacher. The teacher needs to know who needs help and with what. They need to help make sure you are prepared for the real world. A good teacher is truly a miracle worker. They need some way of assessing students. But this is not the way. The students should have many more options in the way they learn, but that is what tests are for. Therefore, it is important to be able to asses theirÂ students, but designing their projects is going about it all wrong.\n \n To conclude, summer projects should be student designed, rather than teacher designed. It will help the student figure out their interest better. It could even interest them to learn at all. And it lets the students be creative and let their minds free from the joke that is our school system. It shows how being yourself and being creative can positively impact you, and could even spark new interests. Therefore, Students should design their own summer projects to show them their interests and to also allow them to be creative and learn in a way that appeals to them.Â",

      "If a school was to require a summer break they should allow the students to create their summer projects because it will be more creative, teachers just make useless busy work and the students are more likely to personally learn from the experience.\n \n Students being involved in their summer project will allow students to get creative and think for themselves. Summer projects get students in a negative state of mind because they would prefer to enjoy their break and hang out with friends. If they are given the creativity to make their own summer project they might collaborate with friends and make a really cool project with all the free time they have. If students were given their own opportunities to make fun projects with friends over the break they will create more interactive, and impressive work.\n \n If a teacher was to make an assignment over the break it would be super boring and most likely just busy work. If it were a math assignment it would just be a packet or some problems to get you back into the unit before summer starts. English teachers often just make kids read books that are super boring and lack their interest over the summer. Teachers tend to make work over the break pointless and when the students do work over the break it makes them hate the class before they've even started it. It also adds an extra level of stress when summer is supposed to be free time. Some kids come back to school and have a forty-five page packet due in math class by the first week of school. Teachers overall make school harder than it has to be by assigning pointless busy work over summer break.\n \n One way this could have a bad turnout if kids made their own projects due to the fact that they won't want design a creative and fun project. Some if not most kids will see that they have to make an assignment over the break, they'll buy a poster board,Â they'll copy and paste a few articles about a boring topic and glue them to the poster board. They won't put any effort into a summer project because they don't want to do work over their break. They find a project over the break to be very counter intuitiveÂ because they've just done work for nine months straight and do not want to keep doing work. Kids do not want to do a project over the break in the first place and if they see that it is easy and has no positive effect on their schooling they'll make it quick and easy and never worry about the project again.\n \n The final way a student made project will have a better outcome is they'll actually personally learn from the experience. If a student is given their own choice about a summer project in englsh class. They're more likely to pick a book of their interest and actually finish the book instead of just skim reading it, looking up a summary or even watching the movie if that is an option. If the student picks their own book of interest they'll read the whole thing, gain important information about the book and be ready to discuss it once school starts again. If the students have summer project in history and really like World War II but the teacher assigns them the Civil Rights movement they're more likely to not do the project. If they're allowed to pick their own topic and write a report about World War II like they're personally interested in they're gonna do the project and do it right. They'll gain from this personal experience and have a good time while doing it.\n \n Students' learning should not be done through busy work or packets with fifty pages. It should be done through personal interest and personal involvment. When a student learns a packet is the most boring and pointless thing a student can receive. Given their own choice on summer projects students are more likely to get involved, genuinely learn from the experience and not be handed premade expected projects where they have to follow a boring rubric to the tea and lack creativity.",

      "Some schools require studentsÂ to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning on their break. The question now is should those projects be teacher designed or student designed.? The most logical thing to do would be to have the teachers design the projects because they will be the ones grading the projects,their the the ones who know what we should and shouldn't know yet, and as long as students are working so should teachers.\n \n The benefit of having a teacher making a project for students instead of students making projects for students is that students would ether make it way to hard on themselves or way to easy. Students would need a teacher to hit that sweet spot for them so they only have to worry about doing there work. It would be easy for the teacher too because then everybody'sÂ project would be the same format for grading.\n \n Teachers have been doing there jobs for years now and have a general understanding of what knowledgeÂ students should retain over their breaks. This is why they should be making the projects not students. We would be getting so much more out of it if the teachers designed the projects.\n \n Many students get jobs in the summer because they cant during the school year due to the fact there at school all day, and the second they get out its hours on top of hours of homework. If we were to make students design their own projects and do them and have a normal break we would be asking the impossible from most students, this is why students would need teacher help.\n \n In conclusion students would absolutely need teachers to be the ones to design the summer projects because of their background in Teaching, education, grading, and assignment making talents. teachers also have summers off so they would have plenty of time for all of this.",

    essay:
      "Would you want to spend the entire summer on a project that youre not getting a grade for, not enthusiastic about, and are never going to see again in your life? Well that is exactly how students feel about teacher-designed projects. It is important forÂ students to meet the teachers half-way in all classroom situations. It is the teacher's responsibility to set expectations and requirements, as well as help the students get things done. However, it is the student's responsibility to accept that help and actively participate in class. But, it can be hard to do that unless you care about the topic being presented. That being said, I believe that these summer projects should be designed and executed by the students. The teachers should lay out their expectations and the students should try to exceed them. I believe this because, in my experience, when teachers try to tell the students exactly what to do, they feel that the teachers don't trust them to make their own decisions. This is also a way to motivate the students to continue learning. If students could decide what they wanted to learn more about, and focus on that rather than what the teachers want, then they are likely to be more interested. Furthermore, allowing students to design their own projects, forces them to be creative and think outside of the box, thus developing skills that could be helpful in the future.\n \n One reason that student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects is that the former give students the opportunity to show what they care about.Â If students are given the opportunity to design their own projects, it is likely that they are going to pick a topic that they are enthusiastic or passionate about. When they do, they will want to continue to learn more about it. For example,Â My brother is not very interested in the typical things they teach in middle school. He would much rather be building model kits or learning more about the ever-growingÂ Star Wars universe and story line. But every year, at his middle school, they do this thing called a Passion Project, which allows students to pick any topic and complete a project on it --which they will present to their entire grade-- and every year my brother does it on machinery or weapons in the Star Wars universe. He puts a lot of time and effort into this project each year and the results are phenomenal, showing that with passion, you can accomplish anything to the best of your ability.\n \n The next reason that student-designed projects are better is that teachers will be able to trust students to make reasonable academic decisions.Â If teachers gave students the opportunity to show that they can be studious, then teachers would trust students to make their own decisions and get work done without being micro-managed.Â I realized this when I was assigned a history project in sophomore year. We were put into groups of two, and were assigned to different genocides throughout history that we had to research and create a poster on. When I was assigned the Rwandan Genocide I was excited to start this project. The Rwandan Genocide was something that I had done research on before and I was enthusiastic about spreading the information to those who had not heard of it yet. This resulted in the teacher trusting me and my partner do our own work without her having to ask about our progress very often. That poster ended up getting a 100% and was one of the best posters I had created because I was enthusiastic about the topic.\n \n Additionally, student-designed projects force the students to think about educational topics on their own, without adult guidance leading the whole process. Teaching yourself is a very important skill that you should have in the future.Â If students got into the habit of primarily relying on themselves, they are setting themselves up for success because every functioning adult needs self-reliance.Â Before someone grows up, they must first learn how to manage their own schedules, complete their own work, and rely on themselves rather than others to get things done. The best time to learn those things is as a teenager. If teachers are designing and managing students' projects, then what exactly is the student learning? In student-designed projects, the student is the one making all of the decisions that affect the project, which is why they can be beneficial to young teenagers. Students must learn and understand how to take their lives (and projects) into their own hands.\n \n To conclude, not only do student-designed projects motivate the students by allowing them to use their enthusiasm to fuel their education, but they also help students become more independent and self-reliant by teaching them how to design and manage a project on their own. Student-designed projects also help teachers form a trust with their students by allowing them to show that they can take control of their own academic life. These skills can be helpful throughout the coming school year, and life, as well.",

      "It is the last day of school, the only thing on your mind is your exciting vacation and the warm weather, the only time that you are free from teachers telling you to what to do and when to do it. When all of a sudden your teacher says that you have a long and tedious project that is due at the end of summer. As a response to this, I argue that students should be the ones designing these projects, in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience designing the project.\n \n Throughout the school year, projects that are assigned by teachers don't capture student's true capabilities and skills. However, if students designed their own projects, they could finally display their strengths, which would lead to an increase in motivation for perfecting the project. Furthermore, students have responsibilities and activities during the summer that may cause a low quality project to emerge if they don't have much motivation. For example, students who compete in the school science fair do very well because designing your own project increases motivation for yielding a higher quality project.\n \n I once heard, \"necessity is the mother of invention.\" This quote is indicating that when their is high demand for something, or if someone is wondering how or why something works, new inventions and innovations are made. When considering projects, the same rule applies; questioning what you are interested in yields innovation that have built this country since day one. For example, Bill Gates wouldn't have founded Microsoft is he didn't research and look into what he was interested in. This proves that when students create their own projects based on questioning and logic, their is a greater chance for success.\n \n During the school year, everything is designed by teachers: tests, projects and homework. In response to this, I raise an important question, how do you expect us to be the next generation of well rounded and intelligent people, when we have been told what to do and when to do it since day one? The only way to give students this freedom of choosing how to design the project without disrupting normal school schedule, is to assign it in the summer. Not only does this bolster self thinking and creativity, but also it utilizes the summer months, a long period of time, to think about and develop this project.\n \n In response to the question of giving students the right to design their own projects, I argue that in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience, the best choice is to give students this ability to design their own projects. In general, these skills will help students prepare for adult life, where they will need the specific skills that are full filedÂ through this project.",

      "Is giving students homework during their Summer Break a good thing? Does it allow them to retian information and hopefully use it for next year? But even better, should these students be even given the privelage of assigning their own homework? No,Its up to the teachers to give teacher-designed projects for the students because they know what to teach us ,how to teach us,and ultimately whats best for us,students can't be trusted to assign their own project,and teachers know what things we have to know for next year.\n \n Teachers are people we go to when we need to learn things. They give us the answers we're seeking for. When assigning projects,they don't just make it easy for you. They make it a challenge ,not just because they want to or because we think they don't like us. It's because they know what's best for us. They know what's best for us in a way that a parent knows what's best for their children. When I was younger my mom always made sure I hung out with the right group of people. She said \"son ,when you're older you'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.\"Now I wasn't really fond of this ,but it ended up helping me out in the future when she told me to stop hanging out with this group of certain people who always used to mess around in class and they got caught throwing fart bombs in class and the whole group got in trouble. I'm getting a little off track here, but the point im trying to make here is ,teachers know what's best for us. They know how to teach,what to teach,the best way to teach us ,and what is best to teach us.\n \n Its not every day that the teachers give us a chance to assign our own projects. This would be a once in a lifetime opportunity that the teachers are giving us. The ability to choose our own project. WOW! I wish we were mature enough to handle that responsability. But,the truth is we would make it as easy as possible. You may be thinking heck yea that sounds perfectly fine to me. But,in doing that you would defeat the whole point of doing the Summer project in the first place. Let's think,what\"s the whole point of doing this project. Is it because we have all that freetime during break that they want us doing something productive? Or because we have nothing better to do? Its to help prepare us for next year and what we might learn. I have to admit ,I forget pretty much everything I learn last year. Which is super bad because when I get into the next school year that information from last year that i forgot could be needed in the class for next year. Which it is why it's important that we make it a challenge and acyually know what we need to study. So that we can retain more information. That is why kids can't be trusted to assign their own project.\n \n The last and final reason why teachers should assigning our summer project is because they know what we need to learn for next year. Going into the new school year is really hard when we have to come in and learn things we've never seen before in our life. But, with teahcers assigning our projects,we could maybe get an idea of what we're learning. That would be extraordinarely helpful to kids who have a hard time learning because with projects being assigned to us ,we could finally study over break with information we'll be using next year. Giving us better grades ,and dont we all just love good grades. They boost our confidence up .And showing your parents your all \"A\" report card can be lifechanging. Ultimately this is why teachers should assign our projects over Summer Break.\n \n In teachers assigning our Summer Break projects ,we have a better opportunity at passing the coarses in the following school year,We have something to do over break,and it gives us extra brain work and hepls us grow our school brains. Allowing us to be succeseful and setting us up for greatness in the upcoming school year. Teachers know what we should study and how we should study in order to retain the information needed to be learned and revised.",

      "Summer is like a brainwash. Students seem to forget everything they learned in school that year over the summer. To try and combat this, many teachers assign summer projects so the students don't fall behind on any of their learning. Students are often upset by this, wanting their summer to be fun and stress free. Teacher designed projects are often long and tedious making them boring to do. The summer projects should be student-designed. Having the projects be student-designed allows for a greater range of creativity, more control over how the project is completed, and creates a better mindset for disgruntled students.\n \n Allowing for summer projects to be student designed makes for a greater range of creativity. A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations.\n \n Completion of the project is thought to be most important. Allowing students to control how the project is completed is much more student oriented. A student oriented project should be more fun and less stressful as to not add anything more on top of an already heavy workload. Letting students decide how the project is presented and what the rubric should entail makes the students not only happier, but less stressed as a result. If the students can control what they want to do in the project or how the final product should be, it could help immensely with the overall students happiness and create a stronger student community.\n \n The mindset for summer is just fun, fun, fun. Adding a summer project dampens that mindset. It becomes a burden for students to deal with. No one wants to do schoolwork over the summer, summer is the time for fun! Allowing students to create a student designed project would create an overall better mindset towards how summer project are viewed. I know that I don't want to do school work over the summer. Giant math packets, books to read, papers to write, it's all so tedious and I always end up pushing it off til August, where I'm then rushing to get it all done in time for the start of school. If I were to be given a project that I could control, it would already seem so much better because I would be in full control over what I did for the project or how I approached a problem I encountered with it. It's important to keep a healthy mindset in school so you don't burn yourself out. Summer is seen as a time to destress and have fun and creating a better mindset towards student project by making them student designed is extremely crucial to that.\n \n When I think of school projects, I think of teachers handing them out at the end of a quarter or towards the end of school to be completed over the summer. Projects are a way to either boost or bring down your grade, depending on how you do. Because of that effect on grades, important projects tend to stress students out. When students are given more control over a project it immediately takes stress off the student because they automatically control how their project is made and presented. Teacher designed projects are made to showcase how well teachers teach their students. If more students get a higher grade on a project, the credibility of that teacher goes up. They are viewed as a better teacher overall. While teacher designed projects might have more academic results, having projects be student-designed creates a wider range of creativity, control over how the project is executed, and makes a more postive mindset for students.",

      "Some schools require its students to complete summer assignments, this raises the question of whether these projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed? Which would be more beneficial to both the educator and the learner? Students would better benefit from completing an assignment structured by teachers because they have received an education on how to teach adolescents, understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about.\n \n Summer assignments should be teacher-structured for many reasons, one of them being that the teachers have been educated on student learning. Before even being able to become an educator, teachers have to complete an education of their own; where they learn the most beneficial way to help another person understand something. Compared to an adolescent, who most likely isn't thinking the same way, it is clear that one will have much more success than the other in getting the lesson through. One is focused on how to get the point acrossÂ as efficiently as possible and the other simply doesn't have the same thought process. The vigorous work done to obtain a teaching degree also ensure that those who are taught under the educator are not put in a stressful situation, learn at a comfortable speed, and are challenged just enough. Proving that teacher-designed assignments guarantee not only that the individual is learning, but learning effectively.\n \n Another reason that proves why teacher-designed summer projects are more efficient is that the teacher better understands where a students is in their learning and where they should be by what time. For example, more experienced educators have seen quite a lot of different students with different learning patters and know how to manipulate that to the benefit of the student and themselves. This trait is most useful in a situation that the students in a class are in completely different areas in their understanding. The teacher is then able to build projects that are unique to each individual's strengths and weaknesses. Which consequently allows the class to collectively reach the same high level of understanding, all while working individually.\n \n It is impossible for a student to design an project about a topic that they dont' already know about. Teachers should be the one's structuring the summer assignment because they are able to give the learner an unknown topic that could even possibly interest them. A student-designed project serves no purpose in assuring that a student will continue learning, but only review materials that they have already learned. Giving teachers control over the project prompts the student to research unfamiliar topics and further educate themselves. This small, but important change in the project designer completely decides whether a student will go on with a solid understanding of the class or forget the only half of the material that they learned.\n \n Although one could argue that student-designed summer assignment have their own benefits the better option are teacher-designed assignments. These summer projects are better structured because the teachers have received and education on how to teach adolescents, they understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about. This structure is also beneficial because it doesn't allow the student to create anything that isn't challenging and even makes it easier on the teacher with grading. For these reasons, summer assignments should be designed by teachers and not the students.",

      "Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively.\n \n If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling.

    essay:
      "Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively.\n \n If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling. I would go onto a website that was used for teaching people from K-12th grade everything that they would need to know. I would do this from when I was taken out of school to the first year of middle school, and my knowledge and understanding of the subjects that we were learning was at the point were I wasn't the oddÂ ball in the class.

      "Should school required summer projects be designed by the teacher or the student? I say it should be designed by the student. If the student designs the project, it allows the student to show the teacher what they have learned. This could also help teach students good life skills for later in their lives. Having a teacher design the project, takes away the chance for a student to learn how to be independent. So, students should be in charge of designing their summer projects, because of life lessons they could learn.\n \n If the student does the designing for the project, they can show the teacher what they have learned in their classes. This will also allow the teacher to see what they need to work on more with their students. This being said, it also allows the student to understand what they need to focus on more when learning. If the teacher designs it, the student wouldn't be able to learn as much on what they know or don't know. Thus, it opens up ideas for students to do the project on, and understand why they couldn't do something because they weren't fully understanding one idea, or many.\n \n A great life lesson this summer project can teach the students is how to be independent, reliable, and responsible. It's a great way for the student to be ready for when they graduate school and need to learn how to plan for the future for themselves. If the teacher designs this project, they would be taking away the opportunity for the student to learn a great life skills. This being, students have a better chance of learning more from designing the project, then having their teacher designs it for them.\n \n Having a teacher design the project would not be as beneficial for the student as it would be if the students designed it. This is a chance for the students to learn how to work on time management. Being able to work on time management for the project allows the student to work on planing for when they should be at a milestone of the project. This allows the students to be more self-efficient for working. This helps them learn how to work on the project better and be able to complete the project knowing that they designed it, and worked on it without having someone tell them what to do. This will help build self-confidence in the students and have them be able to complete a task more efficient when they do it.\n \n Having students design their summer projects for school is a good idea. It has them showing their teacher what they have learned. Also have them learning life skills/lessons from this project. The students can also learn time management, and learn how to be more self-confident and more self-efficient. All of these lessons or skills help a student learn, and demonstrate to their teacher what good of a worker they are, when the student designs the project.",

      "Should teachers or students be the ones creating designing the summer projects?Â Summer projects are created to help the students better retain the information from the previous school year.Â On one hand the students might want to design the project based on what they want to do, and on the other hand the teacher might want to design the project to make sure that the students study what they are meant to. I say the teachers should be the ones that are in charge of designing the summer projects for students because, the the teachers could keep the curriculum well rounded, in the be much easier for the teachers and the students to follow the rubric while either grading or working, and if need be teachers could alter or personalize the projects to better suit an individuals or groups lack of knowledge of a specific unit.\n \n If teachers were the ones designing the summer projects than they could put a little bit of everything from the previous years curriculum. Students who already know one subject extremely well wouldn't be able to just do the entire summer project on that an forget the rest of it. Students would retain the information much better if the projects weren't focused on just one subject but all of them. They would recall the material as they worke on small portions of the units in the projects. Coming the next the students would be better prepared to continue learning new material.\n \n If teachers were to design the projects they would be able to creat a rubric. Students who had to work on the projects could then better follow exactly what they were supposed to complete and review. The project would be easier to finish if they had a rubric to check to see if they were on the right track. Once the summer project is due and turned in to the teacher, the grading process would be quicker and easier. The teacher could check off sections of the rubric to see if a student did a part correct or not. The grading would be done faster so the teacher could move on to more inmortant things like the current school year.\n \n Say a student was strugling in a couple subjects of the material from the previous year. A teacher could design the summer project to better help the student learn the information to move on the next school year. The teacher could even put different people into groups in order for the students to learn together and figure out the problems by themselves for better information retention.\n \n Teachers designing summer projects would help the summer projects stay well balanced in the information, easier for the both the students and the teachers, and better for peronalized learning for the students. Summer projects are meant for the students to learn and recall the material so why not give students the best learning experuence while doing it. For a project to be easier and much more helpful goes a long way in helping a student succeed. Isn't that what the summer project is all about?Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete projects during summer break. Teachers do this so that students don't become lazy when they return to school and it keeps their brains working. Doing projects during summer break will ensure that all students keep using their brains and don't just \"turn them off.\" Projects should be teacher-designed because the projects won't be off topic, and the criteria will be correct; even though, students will be more interested in the work if they could create it.\n \n First, the project won't be off topic if it's created by a teacher. The teachers know what students need to be taught before graduation and can make sure the project benefits the students. Doing this, students may get to graduate sooner if the projects cover what could be taught in a classroom. With the teachers creating the projects, they can ensure that the students are learning what needs to be learned and there are no mistakes.\n \n Secondly, all the criteria in the project will be correct. Teachers are more experienced in creating work for the students; therefore, the projects will be challenging enough to keep students brains working and it will all be correct. Students would have a hard time trying to come up with a project and having to create it all at the same time. It would be less challenging for the kids and less stressful for the teachers.\n \n However, with students making the projects this will ensure that the students will be more interested in the topics. Students will be more inclined to do the work if it's something they like and can choose. People would complete more work doing something they like. With that, teachers may see a rise in grades if students can complete something that is in their best interest.\n \n Lastly, projects should be teacher-designed because the projects won't be off topic, and the criteria will be correct; even though, students will be more interested in work if they could create it. If students have to do work during summer break, then they have to make sure that it is beneficial. Teachers should create them so that all the projects help each individual.

      "Students take their summer break to relax and have fun, but others will have a few projects to complete before school starts again. Many schools in the country will require students to complete summer projects, they want to ensure that students are still learning over break. I believe that these summer projects should be student designed because it allows them to be creative, they can pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like.\n \n Having students design their projects will allow them to be creative, many students would not enjoy the project as much if the teacher has a set design on how the project will be. Students would not be eager to do it and delay the assignment waiting till last minute to start it; allowing them to have full creative ability will produce incredible work. Students can express artistic ability with their work allowing them to draw pictures, use different mediums, lavish colors, and think of creative designs. Just giving them that freedom could make the assignment exciting instead of feeling like a chore they are forced to do.\n \n Students can pick topics they are interested in allowing them to enjoy the project. If the teacher assigns a topic students are not interested in, it would not be an enjoyable time. The students would not be motivated to do research on the topic, they would push off on the assignment, and be completely unaware of important facts in their topic. By allowing them to chose any topic it would make learning fun, a student can be fascinated by a topic but never had the opportunity to thoroughlyÂ research it and this would be the chance. The research they would do may mean a lot to them, it could be a future occupation they want to be helping them learn the requirements needed for specific facilities, schools, and how much money they would make. It could also allow for students to be informed on a topic they do not know much about and would like to be knowledgeable in a certain field. Having students chose would be an incredible opportunity to learn.\n \n Lastly, students are able to do the projects how they would like to do it. Having the teacher decide how the project will be set up may be underwhelming for students or difficult to set up. By allowing them to chose how to do their project will result in creative ideas and make the project less difficult. Some students may want to do something else than a regular PowerPoint, they could make a book filled with all the information needed and they can draw pictures. Maybe they want to do videography, they could film a music video or a short film with a script and actors. Also by allowing them to chose it could create less pressure for the students, there are many sites that have layouts and videos guiding them with their project. If they are not able to do it how the teacher wants it they cannot ask them for help they are over break and could not have the teacher's contact information.\n \n The summer projects are a great way to assure students are still learning over break but allowing the students to design their projects would be an incredible opportunity for them to be creative, pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like. I believe this would be a good opportunity for schools and students to keep learning even over their break and encourage them to always be knowledgeableÂ  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      'Should summer projects be student-designed? In my opinion, yes; I feel as though summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to express their creativity and have the freedom to think outside the box, rather than be held back of their ideas and inner thoughts. On the other hand, teachers also feel as though that they should be allowed to give specific project topics or ideas to their students, instead of students creatively thinking for themselves due to a lack of performance in the classroom. Though, teachers believe summer projects should be designed through their ideas due to poor performance in the classroom, students should be given a chance to express themselves and the freedom to create their own projects.\n \n As a student, summer break is supposed to be a time to get away from school, classwork, homework, and a time to relax. However, in other schools; learning never stops. Due to schools wanting kids to learn during summer vacation, students are given summer projects to keep them focused. All students around different schools believe that having the chance to create things using their ideas will enhanceÂ their learning experience. Also, students feel as though that teachers are more in tune of what the students feel or want, rather than give them an assignment that doesn\'t appeal to them as much. Furthermore, I; myself as a student has had the chance to receive student-designed projects and to me, it\'s one of the greatest things not only for me, but for my classmates as well; it allows us to show our ability in what we know how to do and how well do we understand the topic we choose in exchange for a good grade.\n \n In other cases, there are teachers who believe that classroom performance can play a roll in students receiving teacher-designed projects during the summer. Some teachers disagree in allowing a class to behave poorly or set low expectations for each other and give them an assignment that will be "fun" or "enjoyable" to please students. Other teachers for instance, think that students need to challenge themselves more in class and not settle for a decent grade, instead; elevate their work ethic to a greater amount for the grade they worked for. However, teachers will also give assignments just based on lesson plans or things they truly believe is what needs to be focused on and assigned to the students.\n \n In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to have projects designed by them to see what they know, showcase their ability of creating a unique topic that\'s original, and allow teachers to see what students can do on their own, than seek guidance to have a plannedÂ project assigned to them.',

      "During the Summer students are not concerned about learningÂ , students are more focused on watching Netflix or going swimming with friends. In order to help with influencing students to continue learning throughout break, most schools assign students mandatory projects to work on during Summer break. Although some believe that Summer projects should be student - designed due to student- designed projects being easier. Others believe that Summer projects should be teacher - designed because, teachers are more professional when it comes to choosing classwork, students would become stressed out, and choosing assignments is not anyÂ student's responsibility. For instance, since Summer projects are not optional students would appreciate the projects being teacher- designed in order to feel more motivated to learn.\n \n For starters,Â teachers are more professional when it comes to choosing classwork , because teachers know that procrastinating is not an option when it comes to learning. If the projects were student- designed then students would most likely put the assignment off until last minute or just decide to complete the assignment without any effort. For example, students would not take the assignment as seriously because of the amount of work required in choosing an assignment. Students would most likely decide to sleep in or hangout with friends instead of doing research and picking a decent topic. If teachers designed the projects then students would have topics available to them instead of having to do extra research and work.\n \n Secondly school is stressful to begin with , and having to work on a project over the Summer is not something most students want to do. In order for students to feel less stressed out, teachers should make sure that they choose topics that would suit student's interests. Students would feel less stressed because they would have good examples for the projects. For example, a teacher could instead chose a less complicated topic such as a list of role- models from the past. When the list is handed to the students , the students would not have to worry about stressing about finding a certain topic. Students could just pick a person that seems interesting from the list then decide how many hours in a day they would spend researching that certain person.\n \n Lastly, choosing assignments is not the student's responsibility. Teachers are responsible for assigning students their classwork. When classwork is not optional students should not have to deal with extra work that is supposed to be a teacher's responsibility. For example, teachers assigning students to design the projects is unessecary and students would be less motivated to complete their projects sooner due to the amount of work. Teachers should be the ones to make sure student's have learned and when student's have more work than needed , students will least likely learn as much due to rushing through the projects.\n \n Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers are professional, students should not have to feel stressed during break, and teachers are responsible for choosing assignments.

      "Are students given enough freedom in school classrooms? Students attend school for approximately 180 days each school year. However, the work does not stop just because summer break begins. Teachers often assign specific projects to students at the end of each school year for them to complete by the time they go back to school in the fall. These projects can include reading a book, writing an essay, or completing worksheets. While some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more freedom, it is best for teachers to design these projects because they know what will benefit students the most and it is less inconvenient for teachers and students.\n \n Teachers only assign students work that they know will benefit the students. Students may view summer projects as useless, extra work, but teachers always have reasons for assigning assignments. Many teachers' reasons for assigning summer projects is to prepare students for the following school-year. A vast majority of schools offer advanced placement courses which are very challenging and rigorous classes. In order to give students an introduction to what the class is like, teachers often assign summer projects. This helps the students in the long-run because they are given exposure to the course ahead of time.\n \n Having student-designed projects is too much of a hassle for teachers and students. Adopting student-designed projects would require each individual student to brainstorm ideas for their summer project. Not only does it take even more time out of students' summer lives, but it also creates more work for teachers. If each student were to design their own project, teachers would have to grade each project using a different set of eyes. Each project would be unique, meaning teachers would not be able to use the same set of standards for all projects. Without having a standard list of requirement, students would not know if their project met the requirements and it would take teachers forever to grade the projects. Having one uniform assignment for all students would relieve much stress from teachers' and students' lives.\n \n Some may argue that student-designed projects give students more freedom. Each student is creative in their own way and some may say that students are not given enough opportunities to utilize their creativity in school. Allowing students to design their summer projectsÂ would make it more enjoyable while also still learning. However, students do not always do things that are in their best interest. Instead, they take the easy-way-out.\n \n Overall, it is in everyone's best interest to have teacher-designed summer projects. It creates less stress for teachers, and it prepares students for the next school year. Students are given freedom in the classroom in many other ways, and adding student-designed projects would make classrooms even less structured.

      "School just got out and the students finally have time to relax. They realize there is school later in the year, but forget about that, it's summer. In order to keep the students mentally sharp for the upcoming school year, they are given medial and mundane tasks over the summer to make sure they can continue to perform at the top of their game. Students often complain about how boring the assignment is, and they have a point;the summer assignments are often way too specific or require an immense amount of creativity to put together coherently. The task of summer projects is to continue learning even when school is out and thus the job to design the summer assignment should be in the hands of the teachers.\n \n Although students would perform better if the summer assignment topic was something a little more relevant, the point is to learn and maintain a standard. If students could teach themselves, then there would be no purpose of going to school. A trend currently is the degradation of students and their worsening grades. If those same students were given the choice to either write a teacher's prompt or their own prompt, all of them would write a terrible paper. There would be no incentive to trying as the student can write about a topic that is nonsense and get away with it. Teachers direct and guide students to learning new things, and they set the standard for the years to come.\n \n Students are fed up with school at the end of year, and now they have the free time to do anything they so wish. Their brains are not in the growing mindset;instead, they are thinking about the next parties or road trips. A student designing an assignment in their head might sound good to them, but in reality, it tends to turn out very poorly structured or lazily written. Students cannot be held accountable to remember every single detail of a particular class to be able to design an assignment especially in the midst of their summer fun.\n \n The last reason that teachers should design summer assignments is grading them. They understand what the assignment should roughly be about. They know the differences of a terrible, average, or great paper. It would be impossible to fairly grade students if they all submit completely random and baseless papers that are not comparable to each other. The teacher should assign something that allows all the paper to have a consistent threat throughout the paper. Having all the students connected to a single topic helps prevent students from going off the rails on their assignment later on.\n \n Overall, those that can teach in school should be able to design something to teach outside of school. Education is not about the satisfaction the student can derive from it, but the brutal reality of how well they can understand. With more students failing, it is the teacher's job to raise the bar and help those students work to get there. Lowering the bar creates a positive feed cycle;students will become worse and worse as the amount of effort required plummets. Teachers should design the assignments that best suit their students strengths.",

    essay:
      "Summer assignments are one of the aspects of summer break that students dread the most. It can make your Summer go from one hundred to zero really quickly, especially if it's late August and you just remembered it. Students dread it because it's so tedious and time consuming that it's less of a learning experience and more of a back breaking chore. Although, if they were made by students it would be a different story. Summer assignments should be assigned and designed by students and for students because otherwise they can be jarring and time consuming. Also if students were to make them, then it could touch more students on a personal level and have more creativity.\n \n Summer assignments can feel repetitive and boring when some teachers assign it, especially reading assignments. It often boils down to the same formula: Read or research a book or topic, write an essay, make a connection, and sometimes something interesting is thrown in if you're lucky. Students most likely dislike doing it because it gives them nothing but a dry and lifeless \"challenge\", headaches, and wasted time for a grade. Also, a lot of teachers mistake challenge for difficulty when they are two vastly different things. Something can be challenging and easy, which is what summerÂ assignmentsÂ should be. They aren't hard or challenging in any way, it's just annoying. Additionally, the books are often chosen for you instead of finding one yourself, and even that's a gamble because you don't know if you'll like the book or not. Which makes the connection part harder because you may not connect with a single character in the book.\n \n Students understand the pain and strife of other students, be itÂ hard work, strict teachers, tight deadlines, or all of the above. What they also have a better understanding in, is that students don't want to spend a month, sometimes two, of their break doing research on a topic they don't care that much about. As well as they don't want to read a book in it's entirety that they didn't choose. So naturally they'll bring far more practical and interactive ideas to the table. Such as having them read from a genre of their choosing, or maybe having them analyze a movie or poem, or just having them do a project on an issue that affects them. It'll keep the same purpose of the summer assignment, keeping you working and educated while you're out of school, while making the whole experience less painful and tedious to go through.\n \n Something that people might think when it comes to students making the assignments is they might make it too simple, thus making it ineffective. As well as the point of the boring books is to help students widen their vocabulary or show them . But, there are many ways to better someone's vocabulary than to thrust a four hundred plus page book onto them. Such as using a shorter book, maybe let them broaden it on their own fruition etc. Also, it is possible that there may be someone trying to help the others get out of jail free by giving them a low effort assignment. But, an easy way to fix that is to have a group of students rather than just one or a couple, then they could all vote and see which idea would benefit the most people. Furthermore, an easy assignment that students will enjoy and have fun with as they work is far better than a \"hard\" assignment that no one will enjoy.\n \n There's nothing wrong with the idea of summer assignments on paper, but in practice it falls way short. But students can provide other students with a fun and truly challenging way without the hassle of bogus material. Naturally, this seems like a far fetchedÂ idea, having students assign any kind of assignments, but it might not be so bad if we just give it a try. Who knows, maybe the students will feel more inclined to do their work if they weren't getting the same thing every year.",

      "Who wants to do a new project made by somebody else thats confusing during your only break? Students lose their free timeÂ trying to figure out what to do and how to complete the work the teachers give to them, and we can't ask for help and get it like we would in school so most students struggle on trying to complete it the way the teachers want it done. I believe the students should come up with the project design because we can complete it faster, the work would be better to the teachers to look at cause it'll be different ideas from each student.\n \n Since they can complete the work their way it can give them more time to themselves, family, and friends instead of trying to think on how to finish the work. They can struggle on the same part since they out with family and constantly doing something and not giving them time to complete it. Since teachers usually be so strict on how to get the work done then it can cause stress on the students and could mess up their whole break trying to finish it or just make them not even want to do any of it. But the better the student can make the project for themselves the more work they can get done faster than a whole different design.\n \n Another thing is on how it can be better work cause of the different ideas. Plenty of families go on vacationÂ to different places with their kids or go to different places doing fun things, and since that could take up most of the time they can just do it based on what they have done that break. Some teachers want to hear about what their students did during that summer, and the different ideas from the students can make the teacher have something entertaining to read or see other than looking at the same thing over and over at the beginning of the year. The way the students think too can change how good the project turn out to be and can be something fun for the students to work on too and can change how their school year begin.\n \n If they schools allow students to design their own projects it can really turn out better on everybody and give them more time to enjoy their break and even though we could come up with it we can still learn new things while working on it, planning on how to work on it, or after completing it. But this is why I think we should have student designed projects.",

      "When it comes to talking about choosing between a project over summer break, should it be where the student can choose their own design, or where the project is designed by the teacher.\n \n I think that if a school has a summer project it should be student-designed, so that the student will want to do the project over summer.\n \n When a student does something one does not like; one does not usually rememberÂ doing the project when one needs to present in class.\n \n If a student can have a choice of any subject to do a project as long as school appriorate over summer the one can enjoy and choose; also will make students more energetic to complete the project on time.\n \n Students should be able to design their own projects because the students will be able to express their feelings, emotions, and inner thoughts.\n \n When students usually start working a design made by them they start with how the feel in the moment and how they have felt in the past.\n \n The first thing that starts to show when a student is working on a design made by them is one's feelings towards the subject that the student's is working on.\n \n When someone expresses their feelings in this way one puts a lotÂ of effort into the project and will make the project really show and really speak.\n \n Mainly because it is a reflection of how the student's feelings are shown on the subject for the project.\n \n Also when a student tends to show one's feelings it tends to make the student work and be more positive and happy.\n \n The reason being the student is able to do something they like and not being forced to do something they do not like.\n \n When students are working on a design that is their choice and the student is working with one's feeling on a subject the students true emotions start to show.\n \n When it comes to the second thing, the student starts to add their emotion about the subject deep down and how their emotions are truly.\n \n When a student shows their emotions one wants to be heard in a positive way; if the student has a choice to design a project on a subject student's choice the student tends to be happier and is will to work on the project.\n \n Meaning the student is not upset when they are forced to do a project over break because they get to choose and show their own emotions on the subject that the student chooses.\n \n When it comes to choosing between a teacher most likely making the project based on book work, or the student enjoying summer doing a project that the student designed.\n \n Also the student would be able to work with either a friend, or a family member.\n \n When a student starts to show one's feelings and emotions towards a subject of the students choice, the student tends to start to show their true thoughts towards the subject by choice.\n \n The third thing that shows the most when a student designs their own project over summer it will show their true inner thought on the project that the student is designing.\n \n When a student starts to show their true inner thought on a project; one tends to be more vocal on the subject the designed because it is how they really feel deep down.\n \n Meaning when one starts to talk about their own thought; they talk in a more positive direction and try to be more friendly because the student wants someone to listen.\n \n Also when students are talking about their opinion; the students get a chance to express how they feel inside.\n \n Mainly because in today world students do not have a say on how the schools are run and the students should be able to choose their own design.\n \n When talking about student-designed projects and teacher-designed projects people needs to talk about both sides, teacher-designed projects can be fun and helpful to learn from also to teach with.\n \n When talking about teacher-designed projects, people need to also realize some students are not capableÂ enough to create their own design and needs a teacher-designed project instead of a student-designed project.\n \n When talking about projects designed by teachers for over summer; some of the projects are fun and exciting, but some are just book work and studying.\n \n Mainly because the students should be entertained by what they are learning and being able to learn something from the project.\n \n When mentioned a minute ago, teacher-designed projects can be helpful in the meaning of learning how to grow plants, or learning the chemical reaction in putting mentos and coca-cola.\n \n The reason being some students when they grow up want to be a gardener and some want to be scientists.\n \n The main thing is that students should be able to choose their own design for their projects during break because it is the students own time and they should be able to express their own feelings towards subjects they like.\n \n When it comes to talking about teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects, people have to remember that everyone should have a choice on the work they have to do during their own break.\n \n When a student makes a choice on what they have to do over break is based of how they feelings about the topic at the time.\n \n Also when a student works on their own design they tend to start putting more emotion into the design because they chose what they wanted to do.\n \n Mainly, but most of all, when a student works on a subject the students share their inner thoughts with the world.\n \n Students should be able and be capable to design their own projects and choose the subject so they can express how they really feel deep down about the subjects so they can talk about how they feel.\n \n When wondering which side to take both are good but there has to be a choice either teacher-designed projects over summer break, or student-designed projects over break.",

      "Do you believe if students designed their own summer projects, they would benefit from it ? Well 75 percent of students often slack when it comes to doing projects on their own spare time. Students tend to lose interest when it comes to school work, you can only imagine how it would feel for them to create a whole project! I believe summer projects should be designed by teachers, because some students are easily distracted,lazy, and careless. Teachers have a more experienced mindset than students,and are way more educated. With all the work these students have to do during summer, having to design a project would just be to overwhelming.\n \n Firstly, teachers are highly experienced when it comes to school projects. Having experience means a lot when you are a teacher, you would have the right amount of education needed for students. Teachers would know exactly how to set up a project and the right steps to require during the project. For example, some students do not know how to complete a project. The experience teachers have gained over the years would play its affects, and benefit the students rather he/she doing so themselves. Teachers would know exactly what to mention in their project to assure students will learn over the summer.\n \n Secondly, summer is a time for students to relax, get comfortable, and enjoy their break. Some students would already have tons of work to complete, having to design a project would just put the icing on the cake for them. At the end of the day students are just kids, after finishing two semesters of school they just need a time off. With a limited time to complete all these assignments, some students might not make the deadline. With all the work these students have to do during the summer; they would be extremely exhausted.\n \n Also, students often get distracted easily. Summer has a lot of distractions around,friends,electronics, and even sports. To many distractions can cause a student to be irresponsible. With no parental guidance around all the time, the thought of designing the project will probably slip the students mind. If teachers designed the project, they could remind the student and the parent ahead of time, and they would be able to complete it.\n \n In addition, some might argue and say if students complete assignments on their own; they would remember the information more. I disagree some students would complete a assignment not knowing anything going on about it. If a teacher designs a project, students would actually have to do some work, instead of writing anything down on a piece of paper and calling it a day. Students would have to remember what they learned and present it to the teacher, which assures they continued to learn throughout their break.\n \n In conclusion, summer is students break time. With everything going on during summer students might not find the time to design a project, but if teachers designed it for them, their would be a big load off their backs. It takes a lot of work to design a project. Students minds will already be overwhelmed of so much work they already have to complete. Why throw another assignment on them?Â",

      "If teachers set guidelines and standards for how they want their students projects to look, then their students would put more effort and energy into fulfilling those standards and guidelines. Student would be more efficient in order to accomplish what the project should be and what the project should actually look like to the teacher.\n \n However to some students it may be better to design a project based off of how they would want the project to look and how they want their project setup instead of what teacher would want. This would give the teacher the opportunity to see what the student is capable of doing on their own. This option would represent what the students have actually learned over their break. It also will reflect how the students take it upon themselves to show what they know in a creative way based off of the projects topic.\n \n However, student-designed projects would lead to some students not putting as much effort and creativity in their projects. Students will do the bare-minimum when they have the option to take it upon themselves to do an assignment for school. Some students may take it upon themselves to go above and beyond for their student-designed project. However some students may take advantage and use it as an opportunity to be lazy and unproductive on this assignment.\n \n Students would not have as much motivation if they have the option to take it upon themselves to create a project over their summer break. If this assignment was left up to students to design their own projects some would not take it as serious as should and some would. The students who won't take it as serious as they should would have an unorganized project or they just wouldn't do the project at all.\n \n A benefit of summer projects being teacher-designed would be the fact that all students had one layout or structure for how their projects are supposed to be. It would be easier for the teachers to grade and look over all projects efficiently. It would also be easier for the students to follow an assigned rubric or setup for a project. Instead of designing it on their own\n \n Teacher-designed project would be easier for students because they know what the teacher expects their project to be like in order to get a good grade on it. This will make the students projects way more neat and organized. Therefore summer break projects should be teacher-designed to be more efficient, organized, and helpful for both students and teachers",

      "Imagine the world if students didn't complete summer projects. Students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break that the school required. Summer projects is like a homework that is given to students during their break. Summer break is a two months break from school it is also the longest break that a student have. School is a place where a student can learn new things in order to get a diploma to have a job in the future. Schools shouldn't require students to complete summer projects during their break because students will be more lazy to go to school, no one will do it, and students will forget everything.\n \n Certainly, some people believe that schools should require students to complete summer projects because they don't do anything during their break. During summer break some students only play video games and sleep. Others may think that students needs to be prepared for the next school year. So that the students will be more advance and the topics that they're gonna learn wouldn't be hard for them. Still others may think that students needs to learn more new things during their break. These people are wrong.\n \n Schools shouldn't require students to complete summer project; students will be more lazy to go to school. Teenagers are already tired of school if school board made them do some summer projects they're giving them a reason why students doesn't like going to school. Do students like to go to school nor do students like to do homework. Homework is one of the main reason why students doesn't like going to school. Teachers make a hard homework. Giving students a project during summer break is too much work for them because they already done a lot of work during their school year. People need a break from everything. Youngsters don't have time for summer projects because they are working during summer break to save money for college. Summer break is the only time they can work for a long hours to save money and to help their family to pay their bills. Working for the long hours during school year will be hard for a students especially if they doesn't know how to multitask. Sometimes too much is bad for people's health; they can harm to a person emotionally and mentally. Emotionally because they will have no time for their families; mentally because they didn't have a chance to have a brain break that can lead them to depression.\n \n School Board shouldn't require students to do a summer project because no one will do it. Students are busy during summer break. Some students spend time with their family because they don't have time during their school year. During school year students are really busy especially those who are in colleges; summer break is the only time they can go home to their families. When students go home to their family most of them go on vacations. Vacation is what all people need to avoid depression from school. If schools give students a projects during their summer break, then students will not enjoy their vacation. Teenagers will feel more frustrated. Students got no time for their selves to relax and enjoy the peaceful environment unlike the school. The environment at school are really depressing and stressful. If school required students to do projects at home they will feel the exact same thing how they feel about school. People needs a break from school and everyone needs a rest.\n \n School shouldn't require students to do a project during their summer breaks because they will just forget everything they done. Students can finish their project for only just a week. People just want to finish their work without learning it. Finishing work without learning it doesn't make any sense because schools give students or teachers summer projects to get ready for the next school year. Students doesn't even used what they learned they just do it for the grade. Summer break is a very long break for a students if school give students a work to do they will just forget what they've learned. People do a lot of things during summer break. Going on a vacation is the first reason why students forget everything because that is their only time to relax were you can release all the things that makes a people stress. The thing that makes people stress are the test, homework,project,and school environment. School projects make people stress because students doesn't like doing a lot of work. Students always over think even tho it is just a simple problem. Over thinking is one of the bad habit that a person have because everyone does this.\n \n Schools shouldn't give students a projectÂ during summer break because no on will do it, students will forget everything, and they will be more lazy to go to school. If school didn't give students a projects during summer break, then students can save money and can relax their mind from school.",

      "Summer is a time period students dream about throughout the school year. It is the promise of complete freedom from the academic cycle they grow exhausted of over time. While summer project assignments may be dreaded by some to inhibit them during their months of freedom, these assignments have the long termÂ benefit of continuing to engage student minds. Teacher-designed summer projects guide students to continue learning effective content based on the educators' experience, and though more demanding than student-designed projects, ultimately prepares them for the future.\n \n Unlike students, who have no experience in teaching a course, teachers have the knowledge to assign projects that not only directly relate to the classwork, but specifically assist students in mentally preparing for the rigor and content of the coming year. Teachers have firsthand experience in assigning projects, as well as knowledge gained through formal training to receive their teaching certification. Specifically, they know how their class will be lead and therefore have the deepest understanding of what content would be most effectively to learn or review over the summer. The time students spend on teacher-designed summer projects would assist their position in the class even before the academic year has begun. Oppositely, student-designed projects have the potential issue of being mere busy work, meant to be simple to complete yet not informed by the actual course, and subsequently a poor use of students' time and effort. Teacher-designed summer projects are guaranteed to be effective in enhancing student learning, as they are lead by the educators themselves.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects have the educational advantage of being assigned directly by the leader of the course. This then gives students the advantage of getting to know their future teacher's expectations for the class and the content they are expected to know. This may lead to lessened student anxiety surrounding beginning a new school year by providing them with a sample of coursework. Summer projects may involve a rubric for scoring, as they often do for academic year assignments. This allows students to have teacher expectations written out for them so that they can mentally prepare for the coming year at their own pace. Summer projects designed by teachers may also mirror an assessment that will be given the first week or two of school. A practice test, for instance, gives students firsthand experience in what questions will be asked. This knowledge of the class, direct from the educator, provides students with concrete practice and will lower stress surrounding the unknown of the coming academic year.\n \n Summer projects designed by teachers are likely to be more intensive than student-driven projects. But this prepares students for the reality of their futures, in which they must independently weigh work, leisure, and socialization to reach a balance for contentment and success. Students and parents may be concerned about the potential inundation of schoolwork during the promised free period of summer break. Yet, the promise of months of vacation from work is not reflective of students' lives after graduation. In the workforce, much more often then not vacations are not guaranteed. Vacation days must be earned or built up over time, and the employee must additionally consider the effect of losing that time at their occupation. The working world, the adult world, does not slow in the summer. Teachers, understanding the scope of their courses, will tailor summer projects to be educationally effective, which likely will mean more intensive work, but work which will improve student performance in the coming year. While the project itself is not student-driven, students have control in how they plan to complete the assignment. Teacher-designed summer projects mirror the students' future careers, in which the work is assigned but they have the independence to balance work with choice activities.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects provide students with the opportunity to use time over the summer to efficiently prepare for the course and develop skills regarding balance of work and play. Student-designed projects would not reflect the content of the course adequately, and a student-designed system does not prepare students for their lives after graduation, in which they will be expected to manage work given to them by authorities and balance their other activities. Teacher-designed summer projects have the major benefit of preparing students in both the short term and long term.",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, it's a good way to keep students prepared for the knowledge they will be learning in their new classes. Teachers setting up their projects for their students is a much more organized decision than rather having the students design it themselves.\n \n Me being a student I find it easier for my teacher to post the directions online, its faster and just incase I need help on the assignment, I can ask one of my classmates who have the class or are planning on taking the class for extra help if needed. Teacher-designed projects are also easier for the teacher to understand, for example, during the summer I had two summer projects and both of them were created by my teachers, once they were turned in by majority of the students, they were quickly graded and in the grade book. Having the directions already sorted out saves you a lot of time and saves you a major headache because you'll already have somewhat of an idea of what the professor expects from their students, as well as it's easier for them because they'll already have known everything thats supposed to be done and could help you understand if you didn't meet the requirements.\n \n From a teachers prospective, it might be easier for them to come up with an idea for a project because you don't really see a lot of student-designed projects, usually professors have detailed instructions on what, and how to do an assignment. Throughout my high schoolÂ career, the only project I've ever had to construct myself would be an essay in an English class, other than that I've never been faced with an assignment that wasn't created by the teacher. It's a teachers job to make assignments for their students, how is a student supposed to learn if there isn't a set of well-planned directions for an assignment taught by the teacher?\n \n In conclusion, I feel as though teacher-designed projects are cleaner and understandable for their students, it saves time for both parties, and it allows students to get a brief preparation as to what they will be learning in the nearby future.Â",

      "The summer months are a key time for both students and teachers to regroup from the school year that just occurred, andÂ to prepare for the school year that is to come at the end of their short break. This time is important to both groups because it is a more care free period where they are not under the constant pressure school brings. This time can be very beneficialÂ for everyone to prepare for the next school year. Studies have shown that students who do not continue to do educational work over the summer months fall behind and lose the information they gained during the prior school year. The most ideal project is teacher-designed because a student will most likely not plan an assignment that is actually helpful or one thatÂ prepares them for the upcoming year. A teacher will be able to design one that prepares the students well for the upcoming curriculumÂ and helps them manage their time well over the summer months. A summer assignment is one that will not be necessarily a very difficult one but it will require time management and if done well, can be very beneficial for the students.\n \n After the long school year the last thing a student wants to do is more work. If a student was to design their own project it probably would not be helpful. A teacher is able to access what is necessary to learn before the class starts and they will be able to create a project that is nothing but beneficial. In my own past experiences the summer projects have never been very difficult but they have required a small amount of my time and energy. When these projects were spread out I was able to complete them well and they helped me. I have never had a project assigned to me over the summer months that was necessarily difficult and I have never received a large amount of them at the same time. It is usually only required by a few core classes and it is not difficult to complete them. The only thing they really require is the time. They need to e done in a timely manor and done to the best ability to prepare for the next year.\n \n Managing time is one of the most important, yet difficult portion of a summer project but it is also something that is very difficult. Not only is it important for that summer project but those time management skills carry over into the coming school year. A project that is designed by a student may not properly prepare you for the rigor of the curriculum that is to come or the amount of time that is necessary for the class. A teacher creating a project will be able to demonstrate how much time the student will need to put in for their class in the upcoming year. If a student is able to manage their time well during the summer months when there is always something better to do then they will be able to manage all of their classes and those course loads better. They will have a better idea of what they need to do to succeed in the next school year.\n \n The classes over the years have only gotten more difficult in my personal experience and before y freshman year none of my teachers assigned any work for me to complete during the summer. I did not know anything about them on the first day or what the courses would be like. It was frightening and looking back I wish at least one of my teachers had assigned some form of work for me to do so that I had some idea ofÂ what I was getting into. It was sort of like being thrown into the deep end of a pool before ever learning how to swim. Keeping my head above water wasn't tasking but I was unable to swim to where I wanted. it took a little bit of time before I was actually comfortable in my classes and having some summer work would have made it much easier to transition into those classes.\n \n When I was younger the idea of summer was much different then it is today, just like the school years have changed. When I was younger my parents were involved in most aspects of my life and knew what summer work I had to do. I was taught that in order to succeed, I would have to do the work and do it well. I would never be able to reach my goals if I did not get the necessary things done on time and summer work was no different. Now I know that summer work is a large possibility for my breaks and f it is assigned it should be done. it is being assigned for a reason therefore I should complete it.\n \n Honestly I do not trust myself enough to create a well thought out project for myself without cutting myself some slack. I would much rather have a teacher give me the assignment and complete it to the best of my abilities.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that all the assignments that I am given during the summer months are well done and should be designed by the teachers instead of the students doing it for themselves. In the past the summer assignments that I have been given have not been too difficult and I never really minded doing them. The teacher is the one who teaches the class and if they expect us to have prior knowledge of the class then they should be the ones designing it. It is not going to be harmful and there is plenty of time over the summer for it to be completed so I do believe that a project designed by teacher over the summer is more beneficialÂ then one that would be designed by a student.Â",

      "Who knows more, the teacher or the student? That's right, most of the time teachers know more than students with the exception of a few prodigies. Teachers are individuals meant to help teach and prepare students for life. A teacher can also help get their students ready for their class by making a summer assignment. These assignments are intended to help students familiarize themselves with the upcoming course they are about to partake in and to keep their young minds active during the break. Teachers have many years of experience and they fully understand their course and its materials. Therefore, homework given to students in the summer are more beneficial if they are made by the educators because teachers will include all necessary material the student needs to help prepare them for class; teachers will design the review so that it can be used by all students; additionally, teachers can build up or revise theirÂ reviewÂ based on feedback of former students\n \n Projects given over the summer are usually big assignments that students dread, however, digesting the contents of project can immensely benefit students because it introduces students to the information they are going to learn over the next year. Teachers who make summer assignments include the information they think is crucial for students to know before they enter the class. An example is an AP World History teacher making students memorize the locations of countries all around the world as a part of their summer assignment. By knowing locations of different countries, students can recall the general area and apply the location to the lesson they are learning about, like the capital of Constantinople and what countries surround it. Teachers may also assign vocabulary words for students to learn. The words in summer assignments are usefulÂ because when the specific vocabulary word appears in class, students who did the summer assignment will know the definition and won't get stuck, unlike those who didn't complete the review. Similarly, teachers insist that students are familiar with basic math concepts and the properties of exponents and multiplication before entering algebra 2. By knowing the information teachers ask for, studentsÂ willÂ work faster without having to pause and ask questions in class.\n \n When teachers make the summer assignment, they create it so that all students can understand, review, and gain knowledge by finishing it. Teachers focus on all students and their way of learning during the process of developing the work; They don't focus on one specific student because that would be unfair to other students. Yes, teachers making customized review for a specific student would help the student tremendously, but that would not accommodate others because it is specific to the one student. A student-designed project would include only the information the former student remembers. Sometimes students don't remember certain crucial topics they learn in class. Establishing the fact students don't remember the whole course, they will leave the topics out of the review which in turn could affect and hurt future students. This could also mean students will create a review based on their style of learning whether it be more artistic or more reading based. Professors and teachers help their students because they have the obligation of educating, unlike students whose jobs are not to make sure other students understand the course material. In short terms, teachers focus on their students and their collective education while students focus on themselves and their individual education.\n \n Over the years of teaching, teachers will be able to receive feedback from former students and revise or build up their review. Summer projects can be designed to focus on the topics that are harder for students as a whole to understand. Through the input of students, teachers will be able to detect the harder subject and include practice for the difficult topic in the summer assignment. Students may also suggest ways to make the review more fun or resourceful. Teachers will sort through and determine which methods of review are most abundant when it comes to the material by considering the students' recommendations. Trial and error over time will help teachers create the most effective summer assignment for students and in turn help both parties.\n \n Summer assignments created and designed by teachers will help students and teachers themselves inÂ the upcoming semester through the knowledge they have of their students and their learning habits. Teachers are there to help all their students and part of the way they help students is through the preparation for their upcoming course and through the review of essential skills for class. By helping their students with review, they complete a portion of their goal to make students successful in school and in life.Â",

However, doing it under the teachers rule felt like working in a factory, and it also felt like we weren't learning as much as we were just doing the project.

Student designed summer projects would help the student's creativity level. My friend Generic_Name and I were able to design our own projects in middle school and got A's all the time, because we made our projects different each time we did them. Creativity level is also key when you have to do projects for work when you get older. If you want to stand out from all the other projects people are doing, the only to get creative with your product.\n \n Another reason students should design their own projects is because it could put less stress on the teachers who assigned it. With all the work the kids are doing, and since some teachers are putting in more time to grade and organize summer assignments, they'll be able to let the students work and all they ave to do is grade the work. I always talk to my teachers on a personal level, and a lot of them say that making/coming up with projects are one of the hardest things to do as a teacher when you have other things on your plate. So students making their own projects would help with that stress which means that they can put more time into grading your project precisely.\n \n Lastly, another way student designed projects are a better choice than teacher designed projects is because they allow the student to learn the best way possible. I always thought personalized learning was helpful. It let students be their own teacher and learn how to find information about a topic efficiently, and students learn better if they are forced to find the answer themselves. So if we make our own projects, we can choose how to learn the material in the best way, shape, or form.\n \n So summer projects should definitely be designed by students to expand their creativity, let teachers grade with time and no stress, and better their learning experience. Not only will students have a great grade on their summer project, but these skills that they are learning and using now will be very useful in college and in the work force when they're older.",

    essay:
      "Projects play a huge role in the world that we live in today. A great amount of these amazing advancement in many fields have been made due to project work. When working on a project at school, many students can learn to form an amazing bond with one another and they can also learn from the experience. A multitude of students forget about school completely during summer break, so having them work on something can help them stay informed on a certain topic. These projects during summer break should be student-designed because it will show the students creativity, it will assure the completance of the assingment, and it will allow the teacher to see what the student's capabilities are.\n \n Showing creativity can be a very difficult thing for many students. It is equivalent to pulling someone out of their comfort zone. In the show Victorious, the theater teacher notices that his students face difficulty in expressing their creativity. Furthermore, he decides to let them create their own act to present to the class. By doing this he notices that his students are acting more free spirited and being more creative. When a teacher allows their students to create their own projects, they will notice a change in the students behavior. The amount of creativity will rise. The spark in the students eyes will show it all.\n \n Whenever a teacher says that there is going to be a big project coming up, you can always see the fear in many people's eyes because they think that they are going to end up procrastinating and not finish the project. Adding on, a teacher-designed project can make an individual feel caged in because there is only a minimum amount of ideas that they are allowed to use. Last year, my chemistry teacher made us create our own projects on an experiment we did during class. I did my project on chromotagraphy, and I was very delighted to work on it because the experiment really interests me. Adding on, I was very joyful to share my ideas with my collegues. During the project, my teacher saw the work effort that many students put in; she also realized that a lot more students had actually completed the assignment.\n \n During the summer many students have no motivation to complete any tasks, so if you tell a student to complete a certain project they will most likely end up procrastinating until a couple days before the due date. Furthermore, the teacher will probably end up getting a lousy piece of work that someone put up in approximately two days. This will never allow the teacher to see what the student is capable of doing. In The Office, a Netflix series, Michael asks his collegues to come up with a plan to save the workplace because they were going bankrupt. By doing this, he begins to realize that his employees have an immense amount of capabilities. He also begins to see all of their efforts and the amount of work that they could put in on a certain task, which had never happened before. I think we can relate this to a school environment because if a teacher tries to capture the student in a box, then the student will always think it is okay to stay in the box. Some people may believe that a teacher-designed project is the fairest way to assist an assignment. However, many teachers get extremely lousy grading the same thing over and over again. I have seen my teachers take a great amount of time to grade even the smallest assignments because they get tired of seeing a repitition of work. Adding on, if everyone were to do a project on the same idea there would be no variation.\n \n Placing the student in a box and not allowing them to express their creativity should not be how a task is graded. Students should not be kept to a certain amount of ideas; rather, they should be able to show what they are capable of doing. By allowing students to design their own projects during summer break, the students can show off their creativity, complete the assignment, and allow the teachers to see the students capabilities. It would also make the teacher's lives immensely easier because they do not have to create a summer assignment for the students to complete. This is preparing the students for their future becaue they are not always going to have assistance on particular things, so it is a good thing to teach them to be independent now.Â  Â Â Â",

    essay:
      "The mentioning of school projects over the summer may cause a few children to complain, but some schools require students to complete them. There are many different types of assignments that can be given, the large decision of who determines the projects must be made first. Students and teachers may both be able to create a summer project, but teachers are the better option. Teachers should design summer projects because they can provide better content, grading is simpler, and they are more prepared to give such assignments.\n \n Summer projects designed by teachers would be better for learning specific school-related content. Teachers who know the curriculum for their class can give projects over the summer that prepare students for the following school year.Â Student-designed projects would be less representative of actual class material and therefore be less beneficial for learning. For example, students will have a much harder time planning a trigonometry project over the summer than their future teacher for the class would, because they are not yet familiar with the subject; instead, the trigonometry teacher can provide one using their knowledge. Although new teachers may not be strong in the subject they plan to teach, projects could be created jointly among teachers in the same field. An assignment could even take advantage of collaboration among many teachers to create an assignment that reflects multiple subjects.\n \n Teachers should create summer projects because it would be simpler for grading purposes. It will be easier for teachers to grade projects they assign, because they created the content and know what to expect. Likewise, if students were to create their own projects over the summer, teachers may not be fully prepared to score what they are given. Children will likely find more problems with the grade they receive if they are given the freedom to design their own projects, because the requirements of the project could be debated. It is redundant for teachers to ask their students what they plan to complete over the summer and deal with all of them. If teachers were to create the project, there will be less confusion and the children can instead question the teachers to clarify concerns. Even if there is a rubric all students must follow for the assignment they create, it would be simpler for the teachers to design the whole project themselves.\n \n Teachers are better prepared to create a project over the summer when compared to students. A summer assignment will most likely be large and have many requirements. Teachers are tasked with assigning multiple projects every school year, so they are more able to make a better project. One of the desires of having a student-designed project may be to give students the possibility to use their own interests. However, not all students have the necessary skills to create their own project that also fulfills school requirements, and so this could just cause unneeded stress for some children. The school year itself will almost always consist of teachers giving an assignment, and students completing them. A teacher-designed project given over the summer will be better for everyone involved because of this.\n \n There are pros and cons to teachers determining the makeup of summer projects, but the positives greatly outnumber the negatives. The job requirement of a teacher is to provide students with the ability to learn, and to create a summer project themselves helps achieve that. All students do not possess the skills teachers have to give relevant content for a certain class or subject. The task of giving a summer project for students to complete should be given to teachers.",

      "Some schools require student to complete a project over their summer break to make sure they keep on learning. Should the projects be designed by the teacher or the students?. They should be teacher designed, It would make it more of a challenge to the students. Teachers just make things a little more challenging.\n \n It would be more of a challenge is first reason. If teachers decides on what a student has on he's or her project,it's most likely that it will be more of a challenge. Teachers can choose a subject the students know nothing about. That opens the students mind to learning something new. They will work harder, put more mind into it, and most importantly they are learning.\n \n If the students designed the project it would be too easy. Clearly students enjoy the breaks because they are out of school and hoping for no work. That's coming from a student like myself. If a student decided what he's or her project on it would be on a easy subject. Not only because we wanna have it easy, but also because we wanna rush it. Students wouldn't really learn anything if the project is on something they already know about. Also wouldn't be recieving very little to no new information, so are they really learning that way.\n \n Although other people may disagree, they can say it takes away from students creativity on the project. Students that have their project picked by the teacher may also have a possibilty of not doing it. They may not like the topic so they decide to go with their break and forget about the project. It's also a break for a reason they want time of from school; finally not in class learning. Students may also have their own intrest that may make him work really hard on a project.\n \n But in conclusion should the project be teacher or student designed?. It should be teacher designed, students just benefit more off it. They get their work done then they can decicide what to do with the rest of their summer. They will have the proper break that they been waiting for. But in conclusion there just more benefits in teacher-designed projects.",

      "Do you remember your last summer project? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric.\n \n Student designed projects could be great since they can make how difficult it is for them, but this is not a good idea. A teacher designed summer project is the way to go because the teachers can choose how challenging the projects are for their students. For example, students would try to make their projects very easy for them to complete so that they could do less work, but this would not allow them to learn very much. Teachers would make sure that the topic encourages the student to push themselves and use what they have learned throughÂ outÂ the school year to complete it. This way the students would not forget the material they have learned the past year and go into the next school year fresh and ready to go.\n \n Secondly, Teacher designed summer projects would be better because they can make the project teach new material. For instance, a math project could show the students how to use a new formula that will be needed for their next grade. In addition to using topics that they already know so that they won't be forgotten, the project could incorporate a new concept. In doing so, students could learn and use these new topics to help them smoothly transition into the new year.\n \n Finally, the last reason why summer projects should be teacher designed is because they can grade them on their own rubric. For example, if students create their own summer projects then it would be a bit more complicated to grade their projects. if the teacher creates the project, then they can make sure that it meets certain criteria that would be needed.\n \n In conlusion, Teacher designed summer projects would be far better than student designed summer projects because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric. To whom it may concern, I strongly suggest that summer projects be, and stay, teacher designed.Â",

      "It should come as no surprise that the secret to scholarly success is to stay one step ahead of the competition. Recognizing this, many schools have opted to assign summer course work to ensure their students start the next year strong. However, they often face the dilemma over whether these assignments should be designed by teachers or by the students themselves. Despite the possibility of kids slacking off, student-driven summer work will prepare students for a future in their chosen field and ease the stressful workloads of both teachers and students alike.\n \n The stress of a high school environment is all but increasing, and has been for decades. This trend has been documented extensively over the years, and all these studies sum up to high-schoolers, on average, being exhausted, overworked and overall unhappy on a daily basis. Teachers are not spared either, as they face the same struggles their students deal with day in and day out, often for no more than a substandard salary to say the least. Therefore, it makes sense for schools to do anything in their means to ease the burdens of a rigorous academic climate. One of the best ways to go about this would be to allot responsibilities of designing summer work from teachers to their students.\n \n Another advantage of this proposition is that students will be able to take control of their own educational futures. The thought and effort they put into their summer work will directly manifest itself in their scores. Those who perform poorly will score poorly, whereas those who take it seriously will reap the rewards. This is the best way for teachers to measure the academic integrity of a class, allowing them to hone in on students who need assistance the most over the coming school year. As an added benefit, students will be pushed to learn other essential skills such as time management and independence which will certainly come into play later on in their lives.\n \n Perhaps most important of all, students will have the opportunity to pursue an area of study of their choice. An individualized approach tailored for and by each student on their own is sure to make learning a more enjoyable and productive experience. In contrast, a standardized assignment designed to fulfill the needs and wants of each unique individual in a class at once amounts to nothing but stress, frustration and apathy towards what could have been an indispensable tool for students' future careers.\n \n The advantages of a student-driven summer project far outweigh the potential pitfalls of such a program.\n \n Those who would be inclined to laze their way out of assignments will find ways to avoid doing work no matter what, so why impede the success of the majority due to the inevitable actions of the few? Hopefully soon enough academic institutions will come to their senses and adopt such policies which provide unlimited benefit to all involved.",

The more students what to do the project the mare effort or thought will be put in to it. who better to make a project to keep students attention the the students themselves. Because while students are on break many do not have people to push them and make sure they are doing their work so it has to be a project that they would want to do on their own. and if a blunder is made the student can't say they didn't understand because the students designed the projects. This will be a way to grab theÂ attention of whoever grades the project, like a hook in a essay.\n \n Next, it will help buildÂ creative students, just as school is supposed to do for students.

Students after the summer can come to tell the public about there how designing their own project helps them in independence and self learning.

      "Teacher-designed or Student-designed Summer Assignments?\n \n Summer assignments are imperative for keeping students learning over their break, as well as keeping them active in their creativity. All classes should have some form of summer assignment. With that being said, some people may prefer to be given specific guidelines to follow, others may prefer to take matters into their own hands. Everyone has different learning habits and some are better than others. These assignments should be student- designed because you are more motivated and perform better when given space for creativity, there will be less procrastination, and theres more room for retaining information.\n \n Motivation can take a student a long way. Doing well on summer assignments is important so, it's also important to give students opportunities to be creative in their own way.\n \n Designing the project themselves gives them that drive to make a good project and present it to their teach with pride. Nothing is better than being inspired and excited to show your teacher what you've been working so hard on over the summer when school starts again in the fall. Students know whats best for them and will have a better project thats more personalized and expresses their thought process of said topic if they design their project. Teachers oftentimes struggle coming up with interactive projects that will get their students thinking. Giving them the freedom to create their own type of project is better than having students struggle to come up with ideas.\n \n Summer time is about having fun, but also preparing for the next school year and thats why we have summer projects. Many students dread summer assignments but they shouldn't have to. School assignments shouldn't be stressful, but many of them are. This is why many students procrastinate with their summer assignments because they have no interest in the work. Students tend to procrastinate for long periods of time, until the last few weeks of summer, or even the last few days before returning to school in the fall. From one perspective, if a student can do the project the way they prefer, they are likely not to put the project to the side. Giving students all the tools they need not to procrastinate is key to a well designed, well thought out project.\n \n Most students are just looking to get a passing grade for the work they did in the summer, however, actually learning from the project is important too. Designing their own project ensures they will learn a couple of things in the process. In my experience, I am more likely to learn something new and connect it to other things if I have a hand in the process of making it. This makes it more interesting for me and, in result, I get excited to learn new things. When teachers design assignments in general it may feel a little forced upon students and they simply won't learn as much in comparison to if they were to be apart of the creative process. The whole point of these projects is for students to learn something new or review something they learned the past school year so it's important these projects are designed in the students favor.\n \n Some may argue that teachers can design a better assignment than students because they know whats best; However, students are more motivated when given the space to be creative, being passionate from that motivation will decrease procrastination, and students will actually learn something if they design projects the way they like. Students are the future of the world and deserve the right education tools to succeed. All in all, students should have more say now a days in their assignments and more teachers should promote creative freedom in their classrooms to further motivate students.",

      "Little Generic_Name was assigned a summer project, he had to: attend a club over the summer, take pictures with the kids there, then write about what he liked the most about it. The project was teacher-designed and was due the first day of school. A few months went by and school was the very next day, little Generic_Name forgot all about the project and didn't do his assigned work so, he failed the project. Some people think summer work should be teacher-designed. I think summer work should be student-designed because, It's on your time, you can write about what you want, and you'll still have time to have fun during the summer.\n \n First of all, having a student-designed project is better because it's on your time you don't have to worry about not knowing if the project makes sense or even worry that you don't finish on time because your to busy at home. For example, Generic_Name was assigned summer work but always seemed to be busy doing chores and helping his mom around the house. Everytime Generic_Name went to do his work, his mom would call him to do his chores or help with his brother, he felt he was never going to get his work done. Having a student-designed project can prevent you from forgetting about the assigned work from your teacher because some teachers want you to actually go out your way and expect it to be typed up, emailed, and done in mid summer. When you can just write about something you once expierenced before and be done with it on your time.\n \n Secondly, having a student-designed project you can write about anything you want, anything you expierenced or ever done. You can take your time on it and not feel rushed by anyone. It's better having a sudent-designed project because if it was towards the end of summer you can make up something or think of a memory that happened during mid summer or towards the begining of summer. For example, Generic_Name didn't start her summer project that was due when she came back to school, she had a few days before school started. She rememered taking pictures on a special night with her friends and family while sitting at a bonfire and decided to write about that, her pictures were already ready. She realized it was easier having work assigned for herself and not from a teacher or assistant.\n \n Last, while having student-designed work you can do your project and still have fun during the summer. You can do it right when you get home from the last day of school and have the full summer ahead of you or even wait right before school starts and do your project. Having summer work that was assigned from your teacher can be hard because they want you to do certain stuff like: visit the museum and write about it, go to the beach and collect seashells, or even go camping and take pictures of the wild. When you can just write about a special event that happend or even just write about what happend during your day at home or at the pool.\n \n Some people think having teacher-designed work is much easier than having student-designed work. I think having student-designed work is easier and quicker than having to write out something you don't know to much about or doing work that doesn't interest you. Teachers assign work that they want you to do, summer is about fun and it should be up to the student wether what he/she want to write about. That's why I think student-designed work is better than teacher-designed work.\n \n Having student-designed can later affect those in the future because the same thing we do may happen to them later on in life. Some people think teacher-designed work is easier however, they're wrong because teachers or assistants expect you to go out your way to write about something. Some kids dont go outside or some can be allergic to the pollen during the summer and decideds to stay inside. While having student assigned work you can talk about something you've done last summer or somthing that happend during the spring and write about it. You can write about anything that happened to you, you can do it on your own time and still have fun during the summer. Having student-designed work is much more easier than having teacher-designed work. Â Â Â",

As the school year ends, students expect an endless summer with adventures and tons of trips, however, a project must be due in the beginning of the next school year. Teachers begin to brainstorm ideas and assignments for the next school year as well. Allowing the students to design their own projects would make their summer a lot more interesting than it sounds. If the students designed their own summer projects it would make the students' summer more about creativity, it would allow the teacher to observe the students' mindset, and benefit the teacher to create a lesson comparing different perspectives.\n \n The one thing every student has in common is the enjoyment of summer break. A one-to-two month period of no school, heavy sunshine, fun trips, long vacations, and valuable memories. Students expect to have fun and enjoy their summer break away from school. Allowing the students to design their projects would let the student now be more creative and will allow their brain to think more in depth about the project than when a teacher designs it. Their summer will be educational and entertaining.\n \n In the first few weeks of school, teachers tend to struggle to get to know their students. If the student designed their projects, it will benefit them because they will be able to observe how their student thinks in different scenarios. They will save more time not only getting to know the student but grading as well, instead ofÂ multipleÂ \"get to know you\" packets that they create every year. It will decrease the stress of getting to know the students they have that year.\n \n When the new school year approaches, students expect to write about themselves and hear about the class criteria and behaviors. A quick lesson can be taught based on the projects the students designed. It would behoove the teacher to do a quick lecture about the assignment and why it was given. It becomes a great team building exercise as well by comparing the projects and explaining the goal of the assignment.\n \n Overall, students designing their projects would not only benefit themselves but the teachers as well to learn about each other and the subject. Designing a project is not easy, having summer experiences can help with that. It would allow the student to embrace their creativity and think outside the box. It would also be helpful for the teachers to observe more on their students' mindset. Lastly, it would help the students and teachers' communication in education based on their overall observation.",

      "In America, the summer break is the longest break students will have. It is usually three months, June, July, and August. In this time frame, most students do not keep with with outside, extracurricular class so, it is a period of no learning. As a result, students forget most of what they have learned in the previous years. A direct effect is some schools requiring students to complete summer projects. A question arises if these summer projects should be either teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, it allows for freedom, allows for creativity, and the student is more likely to place more effort.\n \n Summer projects should be student based because it allows for more freedom. When a project is assigned by a teacher, a student may not put the effort they are capable of because the project bores the student. To solve this, the projects should be determined by the student. This allows for more freedom to choose and the student has an urge to complete because they had chose it. This may also take off a burden for the teacher, who has to develop a project for the class. If a students has the freedom to chose their project, they will be more likely to complete it.\n \n Student-designed summer projects allows for creativity. Students are allowed to chose their projects on whatever they like. Whether it be math, science, english, history, or any other subject the student is interested in. As a result of this, the students are allowed to direct the project in whichever way they wish. This direction will make the student more interested in their project, as it is one of their interests. When students are interested in a certain topic, they will be more likely to complete it faster and put more effort into it. Student-designed projects will have more effort placed into it.\n \n Lastly, if summer projects are student-designed, the student will be more likely to place more effort. Alongside grades, this gives the student an added incentive. If students design their own project, since it will be their interest, they will be more likely to complete. There are several students who place minimal effort, or no effort at all in projects, especially if the topic does not interest them. This can be solved if the project were student-designed. Summer projects, in which were designed by the students, will have a higher chance of being completed and having more effort placed into them.\n \n Critics may argue, saying students will abuse this and make the project as simple as possible. Although this may happen, it is the teacher's job to provide guidelines on the project. Such as how many slides, if it is a presentation, or words, if it is an essay, or minutes, if it is a speech. The teachers will be in control of the format of the project. This disallows the student to simplify the project.\n \n To conclude, schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed, because it allows for freedom, allows for creativity, and there is more effort in the project.Â",

      "Summer break is a time for everyone to decompress and relax after a long school year. Projects over break are stressful, especially teacher-designed ones. Breaks should be spent having fun and spending time with family/friends. Students work their butts of enough during the year and shouldnt have to do that over summer. Summer projects should be student-designed because it'llÂ give students a chance to make the project chill, it will allow more independence for the students, and it will have a better chance of making the students summer adventurous.\n \n The one thing students ask of the most would be a laid back summer. Because of all the stress they endure during the year, students want a bit of time to reflect and relax. If students make their own projects they could make it very simple. Most may think of that as taking a shortcut through life, but in reality they do enough work as it is in school. If teachers made the projects, chances are they'd want to challenge the students a lot. When projects are teacher-designed students are less likely to complete it. To add on students wouldn't want to ruin their schedule with a boring project that their teacher designed; they'd want their project to be less time consuming during break.\n \n One key factor for students is a sense of independence. Students are growing older and majority of them want to do tasks on their own. Doing their own projects would give them that freedom. The project could also be a way for them to boost their confidence in what they are capable of doing. It would be a great way for them to see how being independent with certain things is like. Student-designed projects may be a way for students to teach themselves responsibility. It would give them a greater aspect of being able to deal with time management skills. Furthermore they wouldn't be relying on their teachers for specific things such as: making a due date, setting up the project, making specific directions, etc.\n \n Most students enjoy exploring over summer; and what better way to do it than through a project. Student-designed projects would allow students to create it however they want. Even if it's a group project or even one where they'd need to actually go somewhere. Teachers wouldn't make it all that interesting, they'd just add a few things to make it \"fun\" but not to where a student would get excited. If students want more time with friends and family, they could add things into the project to make that happen. Teachers are known as the \"fun killers\", so students would get the chance to take matters into their own hands and fix that.\n \n Overall people may think teacher-designed projects are better because of teachers \"knowing what they are doing\", but that is not always true. It is good to let students take over sometimes. It is also a great way for teachers to see the potential for their students. Student- designed projects can show one's creativity and imagination. Teachers don't always get to see that side of students during the year. To conclude it all students should be able to design their own projects to attain their independence, add some adventure to their break, and gain a relaxing summer break.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "In order to keep students minds refreshed and thinking, it is crucial for them to learn even when away from school. During summer many students forget about their studies which is why some schools require summer projects. These projects ensure that the students are learning new material over break. In order to make the kids more interested, these projects should be student-designed. If these projects were student-designed they wouldÂ help students develop new skills, learn topics their interested in, and make students more motivated to learn.\n \n Students would develop many new skills if their summer projects were designed by them. The students would develop responsibility in the sense that they have to hold themselves accountable and actually do their job of creating the project. Most students are used to their teachers assigning them projects so this would also force them to get out of their comfort zone and do something their not used to. If the projects were student-designed it would also teach the students time management skills since they would have to create and complete their own project by the end of the summer.\n \n Student-designed projects also let students research topics that they are interested in. When teachers assign projects the students are forced to learn certain material but letting them design their own project gives them the freedom to learn about different topics. Even though the students are learning about the topics they have chosen, they are still learning new information and keeping their brain working. The students may even do more leaning than if a teacher had assigned the project because they are actually interested and wanting to learn.\n \n Having summer projects be student-designed would also make the kids more motivated to learn. If the students are able to pick their own topic and control what they are learning about they will be more motivated to complete the project. Letting the students have choices on their project makes it a lotÂ easier and interesting for them resulting in them being motivated to finish it.\n \n Student-designed projects would assure the students continue learning on their break. It would teach them many useful skills and prepare them for doing large tasks on their own. Some may argue student-designed projects give kids too much freedom but student-designed projects allows the students to enjoy their summer while also learning new information. The project keeps the student thinking and using his/her knowledge which should be all that matters. Student-designed projects keeps students motivated and interested in learning.",

      "Teachers work much harder than students do. They make lesson plans, attend countless meetings, and grade their student's assignments. Why would they want to work harder than already do? Summer assignments are not meant to be gruelingÂ tasks for the student or the teacher; simply, they overview materials pertinent to the class so that during the school year, teachers won't have to spend time going over fundamental concepts and students won't have to spend time relearning old topics. If teachers were to assign summer projects, they would give a solid foundation for the curriculum of the class, teachers could be of help to students who don't understand, and it would make both the student and the teacher's school year easier.\n \n Knowing and teaching a curriculum to a class is the basis of a teacher's job. Because of their experience with students and knowledge of the school system, a good teacher is in the best position to divvy summer assignments to an upcoming class. For example, accelerated math classes require a strong grasp of basic concepts. Going into calculus, being proficient in algebra, trig identities, properties of logarithms, and knowing graphs are a few of the many fundamental concepts that are frequently applied before doing any actual calculus. The average student would not go out of their way remember what they learned so many years ago. If a teacher is trying to teach their students new mathematical concepts and they don't have these basics, then the students will fail to understand. Because a teacher would have access to the proper prerequisites, a teacher-designed summer assignment would include the most integral topics required to be successful in their course.\n \n Even with Google and countless online videos and articles, the most efficient way to learn would be one on one with a professional. A virtual lesson cannot give a student the same feedback that a teacher can. For example, in Latin classes, noun and verb endings can be memorized as easily as the alphabet. However, identifying how those endings relate to all the different grammatical constructions can be difficult. Google Translate cannot explain why certain endings change the meaning of a verb or a noun, its algorithm only spits out an inaccurate and basic translation with no regard to context. A readily available teacher could review the whole translation in context, go over any confusion of grammatical concepts, then supplement their explanation with some credible resources for the student to use. Unlike school, the teacher will not always be there to help, but they wouldn't set their students up for failure either. With enough guidance, students can learn on their own and teachers will consequently recognize how their different students will learn best during the school year.\n \n Being a teacher requires so much patience towards their students, co-workers, and higher ups. They can really only attempt to control the student aspect. Dealing with student and parent complaints would be so detrimental to a teacher's morale, so why would they make assignments that their students mostly dislike? Not only that, but grading challenging and dynamic assignments would be so tiring and time consuming. After break, that simple summer assignment puts a letter in the grade bookÂ and, if done correctly, makes the students feel accomplished and primed for learning. Now that the students are equipped with a basic understanding of the class and the teacher has begun to understand the learning patterns of their students, the school year is set up to be smooth and successful.\n \n Even though students might complain or question at their teacher's methods towards learning, they are professionals and know what they are doing. A teacher should want their students to be as successful as their potential allows, so the teacher-designed summer assignments would be reasonably challenging and include the most important topics with regards to the subject. If properly executed, teacher-designed summer assignments are best suited to set up an easy and enjoyable school year.Â",

      "Some teachers always told me \" you can never stop learning\".\n \n You can really never stop learning, and teachers know that. Thats why teachers should design summer projects, to help a student be above what they were the following year,and help them have a jump start when they go into the next year by helping them retain information and having them explore into the subject they are going to learn the next year. Its good to remember that the key to learning is to never stop learning, and teacher know that the best.\n \n Some teachers like to give assignments to students over the summer to help them retain any information that can help them in their next year if school. English teacher usually let students pick a book and they have to write a essay or give a presentation about the book. Other teachers might have you explore what you are going to learn next year and make you do a project on the subject you are going into next year to see if it can give you a jump start in your subject. With this jump start you will be above other students who were not given a summer project by their teacher, assuring that you will succeed in your subject.\n \n Teachers will normally give the student all summer to finish their project. This is more than enough time to do a project especially during summer break because you have more time during the day. During the school year teachers give a time period to finish a project and it is usually a lotÂ shorter than 2 months. Students should have no excuse to not be able to finish a summer project assigned by their teacher. With having 2 months to do an assignment you can break it up in parts and do it throughout the whole break to help you even more o retain information.\n \n Coming back to school with a fresh memory is the key to succeed. It will help you go back to school already feeling refreshed with everything you need to know. If a student were to design a project to do over the summer they would make it about stuff they are already good at or mastered, When a teacher designs it, it's to help you learn something you will need for the next year. When teachers design these projects its to help students and some students don't really understand. They think it's just a teacher giving them work to do over the break they are not supposed to have work during, but its designed to help them learn.\n \n Giving a summer assignment is a way to never stop learning. I believe teachers should design the projects students do because they usually know what students need to know for the up-coming year. Teacher like to assign summer projects so students can continue learning even after their long summer break. This isn't a bad idea, after all, they give the students around 2 months to finish the project depending on how long their break is. This will help students retain some information that can help them in their up-coming school year so they can have a fresh memory coming back. If students were to design a school project they would usually take advantage and not give themselves a good enough project to help them retain information.",

    essay:
      "School projects offer students with the chance to a more engaging and creative way of learning through their own forms of research, application, and presentation of what they are learning about in school. During school, projects are often based off of particular subjects of study in different classes, such as making shapes with parabola equation graphs in Algebra II or a poster of the effects of the Battle of Generic_City in WWII in AP World History. Although projects during the school year offer a new path of more in depth learning for many students, summer projects outside of school can offer new skills, learning, and engagement beyond the classroom and can sharpen students' minds for the next school year ahead of them. Summer projects should not only act as a new form of learning, but should also act as a freeway for students' creativity, passions, and interests to travel through their work. Summer projects should be student-driven and designed in order to keep the student engaged and interested in what they are doing, to allow them the freedom of summer vacation, and to increase the value of what they learned to them and their intellectual development.\n \n During the summer, students have more time to focus on what they enjoy and are engaged in. From traveling to sports, students have way more interest in things they enjoy doing in the summer rather than teacher-designed school activities and projects, things that they have experienced throughout the whole school year prior. Students should have the opportunity to learn about something that they are interested in in order to keep them engaged and do their best work on the summer project. Although basic guidelines should be given by teachers of broad knowledge of instructions to give the student a framework, students should be able to pick a topic and media that will keep them motivated to complete the project to the best of their ability. For example, if a student is interested in the environmental issues facing the Amazon Rainforest, the summer should be an opportunity for them to show their interest in that particular subject while also learning valuable lessons of accountability and new learning for a school grade.\n \n Summer is also a time for students to have freedom from the walls of their school building and to experience new and exciting things. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed: students should have the opportunity to learn through ways that they love and are engaged in, allowing them freedom to grow and learn through their own motivations. If summer projects for students were teacher-designed, already handing students a topic, media, and specific guidelines, a student would loose the value of summer freedom and the break from school-designed activities and projects. This could lead the student to become less engaged, less responsible, and less-likely to do their best work, due to being confined by teacher-given provisions. Students already experience this throughout an entire school year and should be able to have freedom in what they focus their summer work on. This will not only enable them to be interested and passionate about what they are doing, but also will allow them to have the freedom that they have all been craving throughout the school during the summer months of vacation.\n \n Finally, students should be able to choose their summer project in order to increase the value of what they learned to themselves and their intellectual development. Often when a student is given a project or activity by a teacher of something that they are not as interested in, students become less likely to actually retain what they are learning and are not able to grow as freely or nearly as much. In comparison, when students are given the opportunityÂ to pick their topic of study and focus along with how they are going to complete the project, students will be able to value what they are learning so much more because of their passion and interest in the subject. This allows for students to grow intellectually during the months away from school while also letting them focus on a topic or media that they love.\n \n Summer projects can be extremely beneficial to students and their learning outside of the classroom while also giving the student a way to express their passions and interests. This is necessary for a student to stay engaged, learn with value, and to do their work to the best of their ability. This not only allows a student to continue to learn during the summer months, but also gives a student the freedom to learn new knowledge of topics that they are interested in and enjoy. Â Â Â  Â",

      "Imagine, your school requiring you to do teacher designed projects while your on summer break. School's want to make sure their students are still learning during their time off, but is this the right way to do it? I think the students should be able to pick what type of project they want to do because, it will be something they are interested about.\n \n If students are told to do a project about something they have no interest in, they either wont complete it, or will do a bad job on it. EspeciallyÂ without the teacher being right there to answer any questions they might have about the assignment. Students that get to choose their project will have more drive to want to do it, because its something they are interested in. They won't look at it as an assignment but as a learning experience for them to learn more about what they already enjoy.\n \n It also gives students the ability to imagine and be creative when it comes to making the project for their self. Students will be more hands on and exited to do something that they get to pick oppose to a teacher rubric they would have to follow to complete the assignment. Also they might get bored and loose motivation throughout the teacher designed project. If students design their own projects it makes them put more thought behind it and use more creativity.\n \n Students may not like the idea of doing schoolwork over their break, but if they get to choose what they do they might be more intrigued by the assignment. Although it might be harder for some students to come up with their own ideas, in the long run it will be more fun for them. Learning about something you are interested in, is a lot easier oppose to learning about something you dont care about. Getting students engaged in the assignment is the main point of making them complete one.\n \n If students are engaged in learning more about something they enjoy, the knowledge about the topic will most likely stay in their mind better than something they either dont want to write about or dont know anything about. Furthermore if a student has a question on the assignment or doesnt know how to do something who are they supposed to ask when its summer and they are at home? Another reason why students should be able to pick their project is because, if its something they arent interested in they arent going to want to spend their time off doing it. Teacher designed projects are never going to get done over summer break, but let the student pick the project and you have a better chance to see a completed project.\n \n I feel like students should definitelyÂ be able to pick their project based on how students are with assigned work they dont want to do. It gives a great learning experience and teaches independence for students who might need other life skills before they graduate high school. It not only teaches the studentsÂ responsibilityÂ to have the project done but it teaches a lot more because they have to start from scratch and use their own ideas. Its a part of maturity to understand tasks and jobs that have to be complete. Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      "Do you want to make teaching fun, let your students decide their own summer projects!\n \n As schools want their students to continue learning during their break, its important that students have a interest on their education so, that they will be able to succeed in their desired careers. Studies show that students are more able to focus in their school work,when their involved and participating. The student's break is their time to relax, recharge and rejuvenate for the upcoming school year, which should allow them to have a say in their summer projects. The summer projects, schools require students to complete should be student-designed because, it allows them to be creative, open-minded, responsible and to have the ability to retain information easier.\n \n Having student-designed projects will allow students to feel more independent and create relationships with others by letting themselvesÂ be put in charge. As a student, I feel more encouraged to put effort in school assignments by working with other students and getting use to leadership skills as what we need in the future to succeed. Student-designed projects will solely be up to students who get to choose interesting project ideas which will be fun to think of creative ways to display our ideas. As we demonstrate open-mindness through the projects, students would feel more comfortable in their topic they maybe struggling in. For example, If a student was lacking outdoor skills they could start gardening, little by little each week to start feeling more comfortable and benefiting the community while they do so. Students may have the most interesting project ideas which make the teaching process easier.\n \n In my experience of being a student, I've noticed that when students are in charge of summer projects, it tends to raise participation in class and help retain information easier. Class clowns become more interested and encouraged in learning new topics. Students that tend to take school more seriously strengthens their passion on their goal. Students will be more engaged in their upcoming classes, as they already built that skill through their summer projects. When I was in middle school, we had to complete a summer project that ensured that we were benefiting the community, most students decided to go to a food bank, go to homeless shelters, volunteer at hospitals, supplying stray dogs and many more. I chose to construct a food drive and give out food donations to the homeless people and stray animals in my neighborhood ; many people in my neighborhood found my idea to be helpful. My neighbors and family friends decided to join me which became a success, we raised over $3,000 in food products which were animal-friendly and safe for the homeless people and animals.\n \n Although, others may argue that having teacher-designed projects will reduce cheating in classes and give students a preview of what to expect from the class when students are enrolled in the fall. Teachers can get ahead start to see who's struggling, can assist them throughout the year and plan accordingly. Teacher-designed projects could help the class become ahead in their lessons in the fall. Depending on your teacher, you may be subjected to bias positions and issues for your projects. For example, my freshman year we were assigned a summer project which was a biased, teacher-designed and the teacher assigned us a position on the issue and had to come up ways to support our argument. Personally, I didn't agree with the position I got but, had to improvise and it made me feel like my opinion didn't matter; I was hiding behind this position my teacher gave me; especially since the issue was about my identity and how my ancestors were treated in the past. I didn't want to support the pros on slavery because, it was degrading to me and most students felt that way. Allowing teacher-designed projects doesn't establish a trusting relationship, making most students feel excluded.\n \n The summer projects, schools require students to complete should be student-designed because, it allows them to be creative, open-minded, responsible and to have the ability to retain information easier. Teachers can get to know students and learn their interests and goals. It should be the teacher's priority to maintain a good relationship with students and to help them reach their goals. Students can learn more about themselves during the process and discover new passions. Giving students the opportunity to design their own project ensures that they are learning over their break, but in a more effective and fun way. Students will be able to remember topics they've learned with their projects because of all the fun they had to construct it. Having a student perspective on a project is beneficial to teachers because student-designed projects may help the teacher learn as well.",

      "Teachers usually believe they know whats best for their students, since from a time long past they were students too, but that is not necessarily true. Its been a long time since teachers roamed the halls of high schoolÂ or middle school, and things have changed. This is why students need to be the ones designing summer projects since students are the ones doing them, the stress of students and the balance between work and fun.\n \n This next bit is simple, since students are the ones doing the projects they should be the ones to design it. Although during the school year teachers design most if not all homework that comes the students way, that homework is not on the same scale as a summer project. With a summer project you are givenÂ the whole summer to finish the project and since it is on such a large scale and affecting so much time, students should be the ones designing the projects. Students being the ones to complete the projects is not the only reason.\n \n Stress is a fickle thing; not enough of it and nothing will get done, but if theres to much your whole life can fall apart. Students and teachers experience different kinds of stress. Students stress about turning things in on time or being on their best behavior. While teachers stress about being nice to students, while still giving discipline. When a student is expected to complete such a large project such as a summer one, they get stressed. Yet if the student is able to be the one who designs and creates the project, it can have no stress involved. Stress is an important part of why students should be the ones designing summer projects but expectations put into place by the teacher play a part aswell.\n \n Expectations play quite the role these days, they cause people to flourish or dissapoint. Dissapointment is what will happen to those few students who never go above and beyond, but stay average if teachers design these projects. Students have many things to worry about during the school year, but during the summer theres not as many. Which is why something as small as this project can cause extreme harm to a student with a project designed by a teacher that requires them to go 100% and their only capable of 80%. This is why students need to design projects, so that everyone can get the score their expectations they believe.\n \n Expectations, stress levels and students doing the projects, are all reasons why students should be the ones to design summer projects and not teachers. Summer is a time of clarity for students and teachers alike, they dont have to worr about grades or waking up early to go to school and it should stay that why. All in all students and teachers both have their own strengths and weakness, but one of a students stregths is their ability to design summer projects.",

Some schools reuquire summer project for students during the break. Some teachers design the projects for their students, but some let their students to design them. Hoever, the summer projects should be student-designed for students' creativity and remembering the content.\n \n First, the summer projects should be student-designed because it helps the students to improve their creativity. When students design their own unique project, they have to come up with personal idea to imply on the project. Since they need their own idea, students have to think more about the theme, content, type of project, and all the things that they might want to put in the project. This process helps the students to think a lot deeper than teachers giving specific directions which helps to improve their creativity.\n \n Second, the summer projects should be student-designed becuase it helps the students to remember the learnings. When students design their own project, they need to remember and understand what they have learned during the school year well enough to evaluate into a project. It requires them to think about the contents for a long time and go through the notes or text books for informations. This process helps the students to reorganize the informations in their brain which eventually allows them to have longer memory on the learnings.\n \n However, even though student-designed summer projects help students to improve creativity and remember the content, there might be people who does not agree with this statement. Some might say that it takes too much time and effort to design the projects themselves and summer break is the time for the students to rest, spend time with their own family members and friends, and use their effort on extracurricular activities. However, they can arrange their schedule to make time for the projects and they can decide whether to make the project big or small. Other may argue that students might have hard time doing the project since it is not instructed. However, it is true that people improve and grow when they challenge themselves. It is better to have challenge for the students, which is the self-designed project. Also, since the students can design the project, they can design it to their own aility.\n \n Since it helps the students to improve their creativity and helps them to remember the lessons better, the summer projects should be student-designed. Challenging themselves is the only way for them to improve and have more experience. It is the better way of learning. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "As a high school student, school is very stressful to me. A big part of that stress has to do with big projects and tests that we have to do and take during school. The summer is our time to get off of school and take a break from learning but that would make it so much harder to get back to our normal routines when school rolls around again. Summer projects are the answer! The only thing wrong with them is that they don't engage the students because we aren't in the mood to do boring school work during our summer vacation. School projects done in the summer should be student-designed to increase willingness to participate, make students think creativley, and give the teachers a break from doing extra work over the summer.\n \n If summer projects were student-designed, students would be more willing to participate. When a teacher designs a project, students usually become bored and annoyed, while also dreading to do the work. If a student designed their own project, the work would be less boring and more fun. This would increase the students willingness to participate by giving them a project that they designed to fit to their likings.\n \n Student-designed summer projects would not only make the students use their brain when they are doing the project, but also make them use their brain while they are making it. The making of the project is a project in itself. This will force students to think creativley and use their minds. They will also be pushed into creating something they actually think is interesting as they will be the ones participating in it.\n \n Teachers, especially in high school, do so much planning throughout the year. If students took the time to design a project that would not only benefit the students, but it would give the teachers a break over their summer. All teachers would have to do is approve their students project and grade it. This would make add another pro to the column for student-designed projects as it would not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well.\n \n Student-designed summer projects have an overall benefit from teachers to students. They make students want to actually do the work, make the teachers life easier, and make the students use a more creative side of them. Although no student would like to do school work on their summer vacation, this is the best most efficient way to make them want to do it. Students will no longer start to dread projects if this is how they will be assigned. Student-designed summer projects are the best way to make this process easiest for everyone involved!",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. I think that these projects should be designed by the teacher. One reason why is because if the student are told to design it they are more than likely to not even do it. My second reason why is because some students might not know how to design their project. Reason three is that some students may design it themselves and make it so easy that they finish it in no time at all.\n \n One reason why I believe the summer project should be designed by the teacher is because; if the students are told to design it they are more than likely to not even do it. So what is the point in telling someone to do something knowing that they are not even going to do it. Some of the students are going to be lazy and when they are told to design and complete a project they are going to say to themselves, \"thats to much work.\" If the teacher designs the project and all they have to do is complete it the students are more likely to do the project. Some students are not going to do it weather the teacher designs it or they have to design it, however more students will do the project if they do not have to design it themselves.\n \n Reason two why is because some students might not know how to design their project. The students head might flow with so many ideas that they do not know which to pick. The student may not even know what the teacher means by design the project. The student may not be able to think of anyway to design the project. Or more simply put the student may not have the means to be able to design, nor make it.\n \n Reason three is that some students may design it themselves and make it so easy that they finish it in no time at all. I f the student gets to design the project they would figure out a way to make it so easy that they may finish it in a matter of days. If the student finishes the project in days how is the student going to continue learning for the rest of the summer. Even if the student doesn't make it easy on him/her self they still may finish quickly, however if the teacher designs the project he/she can make it more difficult for those who are smarter than some of the others. If the students get the project designed specifically for them it would take them more time which means they continue to learn all summer.\n \n Those are my three reasons why I believe that the teacher should design the summer project and not the students. Reason one was because if the students are told to design the summer project they are more than likely not even going to do it at all. Reason two was because some students might know how to design their project. Reason three was because some students may design it to where it's so easy they finish it in no time at all.Â Â",

      "Why is making summer projects student-designed a good option? If teachers created the summer projects, students willÂ not apply it to real life situations if possible, and will also may find no interest in the type of project they are being forced into completing. If summer assignments are student-designed, more students would take an interest and be willing to complete it.\n \n If the summer assignments are student-designed, then they may be more creative based. Students who are able to use creativity may enjoy completing the summer assignment, because they have the ability to use their interests to complete the assignment. For example, if a student needs to complete an assignment on aerodynamics for a science class, and they are interested in how planes work, they could go to an airport, or watch a movie on them. This would work as a student based project because,Â the student has an interest in airplanes so he would be able to apply his interests to the project assigned. He could find the formula that applies to making planes fly. Another example may be if a student needs to complete a science project on how photosynthesis works.Â This would work as a student based project because, if the student has an interest in art, they could use their drawing capabilities to their advantage and draw the process of photosynthesis out.Â Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can use creativity.\n \n If the summer assignments are student-designed, students will be able to brainstorm how they think is best fit to present and/or complete a project.Â An example of this is if a student is assigned a project from math to find the dimensions of anything, and explain why it is able to stand with those dimensions, they could choose whatever they see fit.Â This would work as a student based project because, the student has the ability to choose the item of his choice to find the dimensions of after brainstorming what his choice was.Â Another example of this may be for an art class, where the student is given multiple options to choose from as to what they wish to draw for the assignment.Â This would work as a student-designed project because, the student has the ability to choose what they want to select, and the assignment is not being forced upon them.Â Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can have the ability to choose from multiple options as to how they want to complete their project.\n \n Some people may disagree with this opinion. They may say that students need to be told how to do their assignment because otherwise it won't get done.Â But, if students are given the chance, those people can be proven wrong. Schools should have student-designed summer assignments because, they are independent.Â An example of this is when a student sees that chores need to be done at home and does them.Â This is an example because, the student is doing the chores without being told to by a parent or guardian.Â Another example of this is if a student takes to notice that it is almost time for dinner at their home, and their parents or guardians are running late from work, they begin to prepare dinner so that it is ready when their parents or guardians return home.\n \n When students have the ability to improve on their, creativity, independence and brainstorming skills, it can help them prepare for what the real world will throw at them.\n \n It will not only help them explore their strengths and weaknesses, but also help prepare them for when they graduate from college and get a job.Â Schools should make the summer assignments student-designed because, it will help improve their creativity, independence, and independent thinking skills (brainstorming skills).Â In conclusion, students should have the chance to complete student-designed summer assignments rather than teacher-designed.",

      "How would you like to do a boring project on your summer break? Doesn't sound fun, does it? Schools believe that during the summer students need to actively learn. They ensure students continue learning by giving them summer projects. The matter at hand is; whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. It is the students project, so why shouldn't it be designed by them? In most cases, teacher-designed projects are very detailed and include many parts, the teachers expect too much from the students. A student-designed project can ensure interest in the project, teacher-designed projects become boring and there's a lack of interest. During summer break many students will go on vacations or visit family, having the students design the projects assigned can allow them to take into account the time they have available.\n \n Teacher-designed projects are very intricate and the teachers expect too much from the students. Teachers have high standards. High standards can be good during the school year but for a summer project this can become very stressful. There are a plethoraÂ of components to a teacher-designed project, research, citations, outlines, rough drafts, and countless more. These projects force students to push themselves. Many might argue that its good for students to push themselves, but it is summer break after all and students have been pushing themselves for about ten months. These students are tired and adding stress to their vacation is cruel.\n \n Doing a project you're uninterested in can be very bland and boring. Teachers don't think about how uninteresting a topic or project can be to a student. Not having interest in a topic can be very detrimental to a students grade and the effort they put into the project. The same reaction can come from a boring class, students will start to loose focus, dread doing the work, or not put in any effort. I've personally experienced doing a project I had no interest in. I subconsciously procrastinated which lead to turning it in very late. I could not focus on the task and was drowning in work by the time it was due. If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in. This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new.\n \n Summer break is commonly associated with spending time with family and going on vacations. This is the case for most students. Giving students a long, details, mandated project is time consuming and takes away from their vacation. As a child of a divorced couple, my summers are filling with traveling to see my dad and spending time with him. I've personally experience having a summer project that I had to take time out of seeing my Father to do, which was upsetting because I only see him once a year. It's students like me who would love the chance to design their summer projects. Given the chance to design their summer project students can ensure for themselves that it will not take away from their own plans and it will encourage them to finish it in a more timely manner.\n \n Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation. These projects should be designed by the students. The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards. Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing. Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects. Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students. Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best. Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family. Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time. Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier. Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessaryÂ stress.",

      "Summer projects, even though most kids disagree with these being assigned in the summer, are a great way to make sure kids keep being productive and expanding their knowledge throughout the summer. That makes them very important since most kids detach themselves from school related activities in the summer and making students have a project done by the beginning of the school year, will make sure they are ready to come to school, be productive, and learn. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will make the student have more fun and expand their creativity while also assuringÂ the best results.\n \n Summer is about being able to do whatever and have fun. While some students believe that big summer projects could take away from the fun, making them student- designed will ensure that students make them based on things that they enjoy. Also, having students design their projects will make them really think and be creative. When grading these projects, teachers should partially grade them off of creativity. These types of projects can be truly amazing because they can show how creative kids can be when given time and a choice and show what great things they are capable of.\n \n Kids always do better when they are inspired and have the choice to do things their way. People are able to show their best when they are inspired and enjoy what they are doing. A great example of this can be seen in the workplace in the way that people that don't enjoy what they do for a living do not normally give the best results. This always applies to every one.\n \n Even though student-designed projects are great, teacher-designed projects are more predictable and easier to grade. If teachers design the projects, then most students will do similar things unlike with student-designed projects. If every student does something different, then the grading system for them will be a lot more complex making it a lot more difficult on the teachers.\n \n Although student-designed projects are unpredictable and more diverse. They promote all the good things about learning and make sure that they are making the best out of their summers. The positives completely outweigh the negatives since you are able to see the great potential all kids contain if they work on things that they are passionate about.Â  Â Â Â",

      "One time Generic_Name was in summer school and his teacher assigned him a project. He raised his hand and asked the teacher if the project was supposed to be student-designed or teacher-designed. The teacher said it will be teacher-designed because he thinks the students will slack off. Student-designed projects are to help students tell others about themselves. Student-designed projects help students and teachers to a greater good.\n \n Although some believe the summer projects should be teacher-designed because students do not have to come up with their own ideas, others believe the summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want, it allows teachers to learn more about the students, and it allows students to be themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want, it allows teachers to learn more about the students, and it allows students to be themselves.\n \n First, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want. For example, students will become more interested in the project if it is about what they want. Therefore, they will put more effort and more time into the project because they get to express themselves. If the students came up with the project idea then it is axiomatic they will complete the project. The project ideas the students choose directly reflects upon them, which means there is a higher chance they will be entitled to completing it. Furthermore, a student-designed project creates a sense of freedom in the students mind. To add to, if students get freedom on projects, then their academics will most likelyÂ skyrocket. In summary, student-designed summer projects encourage students to complete it with hard workÂ and perseverance.\n \n Second, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the teachers to learn more about the students. These projects give off a sense of how the teachers should treat the students. For example, if the student does poorly on the project and is very weak in presenting, then the teacher should know what to do. The teacher should gather the information and come to a conclusion which states that the student needs help. However, if a student does a really emotional and heart touchingÂ project then the teacher should get involved. The teachers should try and communicate with the students and sympathize towards them, and maybe even take it a little easy on them since they are going through a tough time. If a student presents a project which is reflecting on their past and the obstacles they overcame, then the teacher should ask questions. In other words, they should try and learn more about the students past, so the teachers will have an understanding of how they can help the students in the future. To put it all together, student-designed summer projects should be a way for the teachers to truly learn and understand about how the students are where they are.\n \n Third, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the students to be themselves. For example, students should feel free about doing a project. They should not have to be held to a standard which they might never get to. Teachers should rather help the students get to the standard rather than just telling the students they have to get there. In projects, students should be able to talk about whatever they choose to. They should not have to be limited to one project idea. To add to, limiting what students have to do a project is how their grades start to drop. One of the most important thing a student should be able to do on a student-designed summer project is to express their feelings and talk about what their heart tells them to do. The whole point of a student-designed project should be to help students talk about what is bothering them instead of limiting them to one idea. In one idea, student-designed summer projects should be a way for students to be unique and different in a world where everyone is trying to be like each other.\n \n In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are a way for students to express their deepest feelings and their wildest dreams. If summer projects are student-designed, then teachers will know how each student should be taught. Students should confront their teachers and tell them why their summer projects should be student-designed.Â",

      'For a better student performance and development, I think teachers should design summer projects, to assure we still learning while we are out of school. Teachers always have clear objectives and they know everything that might support our learning process. I think that teachers have also the biggest background knowledge that we will need, I mention that because teachers always will be there to support us in whatever we need and to see our performance as a students. An adult person always would see things different than us, In this case teachers are the best persons that will evaluate what we have, or what we have to work on because of the knowledge that they have already mastered.\n \n Teachers always have clear objectives an they also know on which part of our school development we are on, and what elseÂ do we need to success. It seems like projects are not necessary, but for sure they are; because the knowledge that we acquire from those projects is not only helping us just while we are at school, if not that it is the key to success. However, teachers knows what we need to work on, and we just pick whatever is faster and easier to make without taking care of the knowledge that we are not acquiring, just because we want to spent time watching our cell phones playing video games or simply doing something non-related to the school.\n \n I feel that teachers have the biggest knowledge and experience than anybody because of their journey. And a clear example of experienced people is Mrs.Â Generic_Name, my English teacher is a woman full of experience, that is why I respect her so much and also try to do everything well as she do. She have something special that motivates me to put my best effort on learn everything I do day by day, because I know that experienced people always tells everyone the right and if they ask someone to do not do something is because it already happened to him/her and they know the consequences of doing that.\n \n Sometimes when a teacher or just someone else told us that something is wrong in our work, being honest before we analyze and find our mistake we get mad at them, but all that they want is to let us know where do we need to keep on practicing to success. Having a teacher design projects would be better to review what we need and not what we want, and then when someone revises our work have all the requirements that they asked for instead of we making our own project without requirements and when someone revise this we are just going to invent thousands of excuses about why did not made it well.\n \n I believe that having a teacher design projects is a better option for us to continue learning because we all still learning day by day, but we have to place on practice what we already know until we mastered that. Since having our owns projects would not help us to grown as a student, and in case of having our owns student design projects we have to mature and think about our futures we all are not going to live the whole life with our parents, we have to stop for a second and ask ourselves\n \n "what do i want to be in the future?" we have to put our best effort everywhere and try to stand out and be someone.Â  Â  Â Â',

      "Students look forward to summer time in order to relieve the stress of the school year.\n \n Many students enjoy the summer break between transitioning into a new grade, however students dread the summer project that comes along with the break. Students are assigned summer assignments that are designed by teachers to keep students minds working, however it serves no purpose to students inÂ their daily life. Consequently, students are forced to do summer projects that are irrelevant and do little to teach them anything. Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity, teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences, and students are more likely to complete the project.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity. For example, when my brother was assigned an open ended science project, he decided to build an exploding volcano with fossils hidden inside. He was not a fan of book work, and he had felt his teacher had finally given the students a chance to make something exciting that would surprise the whole school. As evidenced by the example, my brother wanted to show his creative side and give his classmates an interesting show that would excite the class about science. By the teacher letting him design his own project he was able to come up with an idea that would excite people and a display others would enjoy watching.Â When students are given the chance to be creative in school they take the opportunity because they want to associate school subjects with fun and show off their creative skills.\n \n Secondly, summer projects should be student designed because teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences. For example, if a student designs a project on how height affects a persons ability to play basketball the teacher is now aware that student has an interest in basketball.\n \n By allowing students to design their own project the teacher is able to learn about each students likes and dislikes and what they are interested in. This in turn allows the teacher to make lessons more relevant to what the students prefer and allows the students to connect the subjects to their interests. Teachers are also seen as friends to the students because the teacher expresses interest in the students lives. This also promotes high grades in the class and students are able to have a good connection and relationship with the teacher. By allowing students to design their own summer projects it could lead the teacher forming healthy relationships with students to promote a healthy learning environment.\n \n Lastly, summer project should be student designed because students are more likely to complete the project. For example, my friend was assigned a history time lineÂ by one of her teachers and decided she was not going to do it, however her English teacher told them to create a project on any book of her choice and she finished it all in one day. As evidenced by this example, students are more driven to complete a task when it is a task of their choice and everything is determined on their terms. Students are rarely ever given an option on how to complete a project, so when given a chance to have complete control over how they do an assignment they jump at the opportunity because for once they are able to determine and decide what they want to do without the guidelines of anyone else. Additionally, students are able to convey their ideasÂ across in their own way which makes them happy because they only have to answer to themselves and everything is done their way. Students choose not to complete work when other people assign it with stipulations, however when everything is their choice they have no problem completing a project because it becomes a way to express themselves.\n \n Many people may say teachers get paid to create projects and assignments, however allowing students to design their own summer projects allows teachers to get to know students, students are more likely to complete the project, and allows students to be creative. It can be difficult to help promoteÂ learning over summer break, however by getting students engaged in the choice of projects it can be fun for the student and teacher. Students today are more creative than ever and it is important to help kids remain creative throughout their lives so new inventions and discoveries are made. School holds the foundation of the future and it is important to nurture the future leaders of the world. Students are the key to the future and innovation and it is crucial people let them have control and feel important.Â",

Those who agree with this idea believe that summer projects will help student for the year to come. Others who disagree beileve summer break should not be invaided by school work. For summer projects to be effective it should be teacher-designed because the teacher is an experts, knows student limites, and knows if the students will put forth effort into the project.\n \n For teachers to have to ablilty to teach a specific class they require a certain degree level in that subject, making that teacher an expert. For example if an earth science teacher were to assign a summer project on the earth's layers that teacher could take a complicated subject, and explain it in a simple way for students to understand. From talking about the earths core elements to how our earth looks the way it does today. These difficult topics for students to understand can be simplified because the teacher is an expert on those lessons.

      "Requiring students a summer project to extend their academic progression is extremely intelligent, however should the summer project be teacher- designed or student- designed. For me this is simple, letting students design their project would give them control of their summer the way they desire, could become an amazing social experience, and give a chance to show their creativity.\n \n To begin with, the summer is basically one of the only times student get a break from school and no student wants to have to work during it, but allowing them to design their own project gives them the opportunity to work out how and what their going to do and can provide them a much more manageableÂ schedule. Allowing them to fit in any other activities they wanted to indulged in that summer. Such as, summer camps, road trips, internships, etc. Then both parties are happy and fulfilled with what happened that summer.\n \n Secondly, depending on how the students go about the design of their project it could become an extremely fun social experience. Especially when interacting with peers on what topic their going to do, coming together to making groups and working on the project over break, showing each other designs, and giving opinions on each others topics. This could become very fun and memorable experience for these young adults and impact them for the rest of their lives.\n \n furthermore, as educational as school is it lacks one major and crucial thing, creativity. schools can be extremely bad when it comes to providing a platform to express yourself on, but giving students the ability to design their own project can incorporate their style in whatever way they choose. Instead of force feeding them a topic they have no interested in, inevitably causing reluctant behavior towards the project. Being in tune with your creative side creates a entrepreneurs mindset, allowing you to think outside box getting you away from common thinking.\n \n In Conclusion, allowing students to design their own project can come with many benefits. Providing them the freedom needed to enjoy the summer, independent thinking, social skill, and most importantly creativity. And all these life skills from giving the task of one simple project. Â",

    essay:
      "Firstly a teacher or a student to design a summer project. Most students would say to let them design it. But with this generation the smartest choice would be to let the teacher do it. Because they're the ones with the experience with making these projects. If they told me to sit down and make a project I wouldn'tÂ even know where to begin. Like kids these days barely know how to tie their own shoe. One expects them to do a whole project for them to do in the summer.\n \n Teachers literally learned how to teach, how to make test/projects, how to make it make sense and not be all over the place, also how to make it fun for the student. Teachers study for how many years four or five for what to let a student do their job and make their own project. The student isn't learning anything from making his own project. The only real thing they would learn is how to put a project together. But if I had to do it I wouldn't even learn that I would try to make the project simple for me so I wouldn't have to do a lot of work.\n \n Also kids these days have gotten really lazy, for example, my little sister in the summer she doesn't do anything but be on her phone and in bed all day. I couldn't imagine her doing a project in the summer nor lessÂ make one. A student wouldn't make the project difficult they would make it as easy as possible. They would probably make themselvesÂ just draw a picture of what they did in the summer. Students don't want to learn in the summer that's their time off when they get a break. No student that I know wants to do any work in the summer and most kids I know wouldn't even do it.\n \n I remember getting a project in the summer when I was in the sixth grade. The teacher also made it and to be honest it was a large project but it help. The next year when we reviewed when we came back from summer I wasn't lost I still remembered a lot of information because of that project. But if a student had made it he wouldn't even know what to put on it. I would've been screwed because I would've done a project a kid made that didn't even know what we learned about that year. Teachers just knows what to put it together and how to organize it and that helps a lot.\n \n If they just let teachers do it and make the projects students would learn more then if a student made it. We also always get those kids that don't do it either way. Just let the teachers do their job and make it they have more experience then a kid thatÂ is justÂ always on their phone. The student also has a better chance of actually learning if the teacher makes it, then if the student made it themselves. In the end of the day the program just wants to make kids learn and get the information they need. So just the the professionals do it.Â",

      "Some schools think that students should keep learning over the summer. I think that the project should be student designed. If we are doing the project we should be able to design it to. Think if the does the design and we don't know it we can't ask because it's summer. Now let me tell you how it would be better if we designed the project instead of the teachers.\n \n If the students design the project it could be more understanding for them. Which is a big help for them and so they an get a higher grade. We could do more research on what we know and we can put down some facts that the internet doesn't know. Like if a basketball player plays a certain amount of games the internet would know but they wouldn't know their play style that the teacher or internet didn't know. The internet doesn't know everything and neither does the teacher so you should design the project yourself.\n \n Say if the teacher designed the project and you have to look up research on the subject it might not have all the truth on the internet. The teacher may know may know more than the internet about the project which makes it unfair to the student. Thats why the student should be designing the project thats why the students should design the project. Like if the BET awards was coming on televisionÂ the teacher may know when its coming on but you could know who the special guest coming on the show. The teacher could not know that but thats why you could inform them on that when the project is done.\n \n The teacher knows you likes shoes so the teacher asigns you a project about shoes. So you go to do your research about some shoes you have so you look them up and it doesnt say their limited edition. So you have to tell your teacher the shoes aren't regular shoes and your teacher says yes they are and you say no their not. You show your teacher that their limited edition basket ball shoes and you corrected your teacher so the teacher gets mad and gives you a lower grade on the project when you got a 100 for the project. Therefore you should design your own project so the teacher doesnt get mad if you correct them on something.\n \n So you just learned that you should design you own projects. So you can look up the right fatcs on your project instead of listening to the internet or teachers. Or tell your teachers whats going to happen on a certain show and spoil it for them. Or tell them how a certain player plays the basketball game when they play as hard as they can against the hardest team. Or get a bad grade because of correcting the teahcer on a type of shoes that are limited edition. Moral of the story students should design their own projects.Â",

      "A project over the summer is a great idea for students to continue to learn. On the other hand, allowing teachers to decide on what students should create isn't the best idea. In the summertime, students love to have fun, create new things, and discover. Leaving the project up to them could challenge their creativity and work ethic. It's not only fun for students, but fun for teachers to see what the students bring back.\n \n During my fifth grade science fair, we were allowed to conduct any experiment we wanted. I decided to blow bubbles and see which gum brand made the biggest bubble. This was fun to do because it was what I thought that made it a successful project. In my opinion, I became proud of myself for taking initiative for completing the assignment on my own.\n \n In addition, when it was time to present my own work I didn't have any problems. I knew what I was talking about and it gave me confidence in front of the class. Sharing all the information I was articulate and when answering questions I was assertive. My teacher was surprised with the quality of my lab and she knew I had put lots of time and effort into this.\n \n Nevertheless, In a teachers perspective of giving a controlled project to students is necessary. They don't always see where things could go wrong. A student could be confused about instructions and do the project completely wrong. Some might feel like it's boring and a waste of time. Giving the student the freedom to illustrate and present their own idea is the most creative way to learn.\n \n Therefore, students designing their own project ideas surpass teachers. Making it fun to learn instead of what might feel like a burden. Teachers determine effort and creativity for the most part. It's up to students to demonstrate correctly. Could you do it on your own?Â",

      "Learning is an experienece that will follow you where ever you go. A key element of learning is the ablity to retain the information. The three months that students are given during the summer break shouldn't be completely wasted. It is easy to sit back and forget everything you've dedicated your nine months in school to. This is why a teacher-designed summer project is crucial. These summer projects help student's retain the information and get them ready for their classes next year. Summer projects should always be teacher designed that way the information is effective and reliable. A student designed project won't be as effective as a teacher designed project due to the their excitement towards summer break. Student's will always find an easy way out of things and that is why a teacher is there, to maintain authority and educate! I believe that mandatory summer projects should always be teacher designed so that student's get the best and effective education.\n \n Summer break is definetly a time for students to relax and find peace from school. That dosen't mean that you should forget school completely until the first day comes around. Many students struggle on the first semester because they are not mentally and physically prepared. Summer projects are sort of like the student's wake up call for the soon to come school year. Proper preparation is important for anything, especially if it reflects on your future. Starting your high school year strong is fundamental to maintaning your grades throughout the school year. An effective summer project can help get to you ready for your classes and keep the ball rolling. A teacher designed project will help prepare you for the school year but will also balance the \"fun\" part of it. A student-designed project will be more fun and then actual learning. A teacher can effectivly design a project that can balance both the fun and the learning part so that student's can get the best of both worlds. Nevertheless, if your required to do a summer project, it might as well be helpful to your learning. At the end of the day, it's about mind over matter.\n \n Many students don't realize how important high school actually is to your future. I mean, they are still young and need guidence. Which is why they shouldn't design the project that they ultimately have to complete. Students only come into class for a grade and not actually to learn. Student's will take any chance they have to improve their grade. This is why a student-designed project is not the best benificial to their own good. Kids precieve school as somewhere they have to be and that's completely normal. No one actually wants to go out and learn, which is why teachers are there to help. They teach and educate students while keeping an engaging enviorment. Teacher's have been students once and know what they have to do to balance fun with work. Summer should be a time for relaxation and preperation.\n \n Many will argue that if students are required to do an assignment then why can't they design it? I mean, they are required to be at school! Plus, this is their break time so aren't they entitled to it? This all stems down to what is best for the students. If it were up to the students, they wouldn't even put a summer assignment! Or homework for that case. At the end of the day, its benificial to the students and will only help them. Teacher can find the balance between fun and work, where as students would be all fun and no work. Summer projects should be a refresher and a tool to prepare! Not an easy grade.\n \n In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are far more benificial to students then student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects are proper and will help prepare students for next year. Teacher's were students once and know how to properly balance the project for the best of both worlds. Student's don't know what's best for them and lack expierence. The essential part about learning is to retain and use the information to benifet you. Teacher's want to see the best for them and see them suceed. Education will be apart of everyone's life and they have to learn to accept it. Your grades will impact your future and should be taken seriously. Proper preparation will help keep students to maintan good grades. At the end of the day, it comes down to hard work and hard work brings results.",

      "The summer is a time for students to enjoy a break from schoolwork. Most students spend their time on vacation or relaxing. Summer projects may impede on students' time to relax, and they may take away their freedom. It is the students' break, so they may want to decide what projects they have to do. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the students to do projects they are interested in and that work with their summer schedule.\n \n Student-designed projects will interest students more than teacher-designed projects. Many students don't want to do anything school related over the summer. By assigning them projects, they have to take time to do something they don't want to do. However, if the projects were student-designed, they would be more likely to complete them since they designed them themselves. These projects would make the students use their creativity, which would lead to more of them expressing their interests. They will be much more motivated to do a project that interests them than a project made and given to them by a teacher.\n \n Many students travel and have plans over the summer. Consequently, they may not have time to do teacher-designed projects. If the students designed their own projects, they would be able to design them to fit their schedule. With this flexibility, students will stress less about finding time for the project. Therefor, students will produce better projects because they aren't stressed. This flexibility allows students to do their best and get the most out of doing school work in the summer.\n \n Many people think that the freedom of student-designed projects will allow students to be lazy and off topic. However, this freedom gives the students the opportunity to turn schoolwork into something that interests them, thus motivating them to do well. The summer is a break for students to relax and not worry about school. School projects take away from that, but the student-designed projects give more flexibility than those made by teachers. Therefor, summer projects should be student-designed in order to grab students' interest and not impede on their break.",

      "The youth are the leaders of tomorrow. This is often said by older individuals regarding the upcoming generation. As a leader, one often has to make many decisions and develop designs for numerous events and plans. In order to prepare the youth for this role, they should be given assignments that allow them to design and solve situations. School is one of the various places where the youth can practice this skill. Summer projects assigned to student should be student-designed because project would be of high quality,Â students will better retain the information that they learn and the students are motivated to complete the project.\n \n The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is due to the fact that the completed projects would be of high quality. Students will invest copious amounts of time and effort in order to complete the project that they have designed. This was seen with chemistry students, at Generic_School, who designed their own lab involving a unit taught in class. Those students spent an extended amount of time investing and researching information that they needed to conduct the lab that they designed. The students also spent hours in lab, running through numerous trials and collecting data. The dedication that theses students possesÂ displays the lengths the students may go to, so they can complete their self designed project. The large amount of effort and time that students put into their project results in high quality work because students have a deep understanding of the topic and strong application which is illustrated in their project. Schools should assign student-designed summer projects as the completed project would be of high quality.\n \n The second reason that schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed is because students will better retain the information that they learn. When students are given the power to design their own project, they are more attentive to the information that they are gathering. This was seen with history students, at Generic_School, who conducted research and wrote a paper on a social group during World War II. When going through sources and evaluatingÂ them, students paid close attention to the dates and originÂ of the sources. This was helpful for students as it prevented them from wasting time on sources that were not beneficial for their paper. Students were also able to have deep conversations with each other about the various socials groups using the information that they had learned online. Assigning student-designed projects for the summer should be done because students will better retain the information that they learn.\n \n The final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students would be more motivated to complete the project. When giving students the freedom to design a project that they will be working on for almost three months, empowerment is often felt by students as they believe that they are respected and trusted enough to develop a project based off of their own design. This empowerment causes students to have more desire to complete the project, and theÂ projects will be completed to high level of satisfaction.Â This can also be seen when a parent tells their child to make a meal for dinner. The child feels empowered since they have the freedom to create whatever dish they like; the empowerment that the child feels motivates the child to complete the task to a high satisfaction level. Student-designed the summer projects would also result in eagerness from the students. Since students have the ability to design their project, they would be more inclined to create a design that is interesting to them. This interest would make students eager as they will want to see the results of their plans.\n \n Student-designed summer projects should be assigned by schools because students' motivation to complete the project would increase.\n \n Teacher-designed summer projects would be less time consuming for students;however, teacher-designed projects would not prepare students for the upcoming school. During the school year, students are often required to create their own essay, lab design and presentation by teachers for a grade. Students completing a design that they have created will allow them to practice skills that teachers will require during the school year.\n \n Overall, summer projects assigned by schools should be student-designed because the completed projects would be of high quality, students will better retain the information that they learn and students would be more motivated to complete the project. These reasons should encourage schools that assign summer project to allow the projects to be student-designed.",

      "Although frowned upon student, summer work, more specifically summer projects are a great way to assure students continue learning during their break and to prevent any halts in their learning process. To maximize the potential gains, these summer projects should be student-designed, as doing so would enable students to be more creative, allow students to focus on what they need to improve, and it would increase student initiative and interest.\n \n Firstly, student-designed summer projects are a great way to enable student creativity. By giving students the option to design and come up with their project (which is, of course, in relation to the class/course), it gives them an opportunity to use their creative minds which they rarely get to use due to the general school structure. In life, it's usually the most creative and unique things that are recognized and viewed highly. For example, in a school science fair, rather than the cliche volcano winning, first place would usually go to something more unique or creative. The same idea can be applied outside of school. For example, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk is most well known not just for these companies, but for the incredibly unique and more creative way he manages and runs the businesses, and the way he conducts himself as a businessmen. Through his creative personality, Elon Musk has managed to expand his businesses and appeal to the more casual audience as a fun, regular guy.\n \n In addition to allowing creativity, student-designed projects would allow students to focus on their weaknesses, or in areas they have interest in but previously didn't have the opportunity to delve into. By allowing students to have more control over their projects, it can help students focus on their weaknesses, thus allowing for greater improvement and preparedness heading into the school year. In addition to this, such a project could allow a student to kick startÂ or advance a certain interest, which could prove instrumental to their future. Most people somewhat figure out what they want to do in life by the time they finish school anyways, but having a flexible summer project, especially with the amount of time you would have to research and work on it, could really help with that decision. In addition to finding interests, student-designed projects can also help students identify what they aren't interested, or what their strengths are. Through extensive research and work, students can figure out their strengths and work to them, or find what doesn't interest them and make sure to stay away in order to avoid a future situation where they end up in a class or even job that doesn't enable them to try and work hard.\n \n Finally, by allowing students to have more control and design their projects, it would increase student interest and initiative for the topic at hand. As a student, I have personally found, that while student-designed projects may take longer, they have generally allowed me to connect more with the class and find aspects about the course that interest me. These sorts of projects have also allowed me to take more initiative in my class, by making me think more critically and spend more time coming up with what to do. For example, I once had a project where we had to look at a certain global issue, but we could choose to look from whatever perspective we wanted. After hours of thinking and trying to find an interesting perspective, I came upon an article discussing the view of economists, and, obviously, the way they thought that situation would impact the economy. As one thing lead to another, I ended up thoroughly researching a multitude of different resources and I learned a lot about economics. It was from that one project where I realized how interesting economics is to me, as it just seems to make sense and can be easily applied to the world. This project has resulted in me being in an AP economics class today. There are many others that have had their interests derive from one small moment, and a student-designed project provides a great chance for students to take intiative and find an interest that could lead on to be a great part of their lives.\n \n In summary, while teachers are the experts and know how to get students to learn, directing the project to students by making summer projects student-designed would be more beneficial to students individually. By enabling them to be creative, focus on their interests and weaknesses, and by increasing student initiative, student-designed projects are the best way to assure students get the most out of summer projects.",

      "Summer vacation is often regarded as the most ejoyable time a student can have in year. Although many students enjoy this time, the content they learned at school can be lost in the festvities. To ensure this does not happen, schools should hand out a required summer assignment of the students' choosing. By letting the students choose, they will be more interested in the topic of the project, more inclined to further study the topic they chose beyond the requirements of the projects and said project will decrease the probability of a student forgetting the material learned during the school year.\n \n Students are far more likely to complete an assignment to the best of their ability if they are interested in what they're doing. The usual projects assigned by teachers are often boring and can be done well enough for a good grade in around an hour of solid work. However, if the student is passionate about the project they will go above and beyond in order to inform their teachers and peers about the topic they have chosen. Students who pick their own project get to show off what they know and what they've learned which is a huge incentive in and of itself.\n \n Students that pick their topic may get so interested in what they're doing that they dive into deeper thought about the subject, a useful learning experience that can be beneficial in all walks of life, or do more research for the joy of doing it rather than for the grade. This will enrich the students education with learning strategies and techniques not often taught at school. It will also persuade them to fall in love with the joy of learning new things and, as a result, their educational performance will drastically increase. In addition students could find a passion in what they're researching providing a goal for the student which will also increase academic performance. For example, I found what I'd like to major in at college through a project I got to choose. It also provided me with an opportunity to think outside the box, something i rarely get the chance to do at school.\n \n Student forgetting information is an issue all schools face. The first month of school is often spent doing review which wastes time in the long run. If students did just one project over the long break, they are less likely to forget what they learned the previous year. The project would have certain guidlines that would touch on each of the core subjects, namely: science, math, language arts and history. By doing this, students will apply the skills learned in the classroom to something their interested in.\n \n In conclusion, students who pick their projects are more likely to acquire new, useful learning skills outside of the classrom, retain the information learned at school and finally, fully apply themselves in an effort to show off their knowledge and spread their passion.Â",

      "How would you feel if you had to complete school work over the summer? Well, I believe you'd say the same as I would school work over the summer is beyond boring. What if you were able to complete your school work in a creative way? Some schools now require their students to complete summer projects to advance their learning. This is beneficial overall to help the students not forget material they learned that they will need the next upcoming school year. Summer projects should be teacher-designed so that students are still advancing their knowledge on subjects they've learned in school, also, so there is no debate over grades since all students would have the same topic and rubric, and lastly, because there's no question on if it relates to their school work.\n \n Teacher-desgined projects have requirements needed to be meet in order to advance the students knowledge in topics specific to what they have learned in their class. While it recaps what you have already learned, this gives you an opportunity to go deeper and explore the topic more. For example, Generic_Name is in Psychology class, her teacher Mrs. Generic_Name provided a project to be completed over the summer about the frontal lobe of the brain. Generic_Name not only has already learned about the brain and the frontal lobe, but now she has a chance to research and understand the frontal lobe at a more advanced point of view. Teacher-designed projects have more of an advantage towards students learning so they learn about a topic in class, but also on their own.\n \n Grades is an important part of every student's life. Teacher-designed projects allow for teachers to provide a rubric or guideline sheet on how they will grade the project so there are no questions for why you recieved a low grade on the assignment. Some teachers will leave feedback on their rubric sheets as to why you did bad, but you can't always rely on that so it's important that the student understands all the requirements and what the teacher is looking for. Teacher-designed projects give the student a chance to stick up for what the teacher told them because they have what they told them to do on paper or on a computer.\n \n Risks related to school could be very rewarding or detramental to the student. Would you want to take the risk of having a teacher tell you your project isn't relevant to what your learning or have learned? With teacher-designed projects there is little to no risk on if the topic relates to your school work or not. Teachers give you a specific topic if it's a teacher-designed project. Overall, the risk of the topic not being relevant would be detramental to a students grades.\n \n Student-designed projects allows a chance for the students to take advantage and call anything they do over the summer their project. Also, they have the risk of a debate over the way you grade the student because there are no guidelines or rubrics. Student-designed projects take many risks that could cause many different problems. Overall, teacher-desgined projects are the best route to take when it comes to summer projects.Â",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Many people believe that projects should be teacher-designed but i do not. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.\n \n First, more students will be into it. If a student does a project on their favorite movie, superhero, celebrity, etc. they will have more fun doing that. Let's say a teacher told their students to do a project on Abraham Lincoln, the students probably wouldn't be very happy about that. However, if a teacherÂ told their students to do a project on their favorite TV show, then I'm sure that students would actually be excited about it.\n \n Secondly, students can have fun while learning. If they did a project on their favorite movie, they could watch that movie and tell the class and teacher about all the funny, happy, and sad moments. You could also learn a lotÂ of history by doing a project on your favorite movie, because you'll have to learn about the history on why they made the movie.\n \n Third, they don't have to be forced into dong a boring project a teacher chooses. Nobody ever wants to write a paper on history and wars. If the students got to choose about what their project could be on it would be a lotÂ better and easier to get a student to actually do it. If you tell a student to do a project on World War 1, chances are they won't do it, or they will put it off until the last minute.

Projects are meant to test comprehension on a given topic. The problem with teacher-designed projects is that they are boring and predictable. The teacher-designed projects also have specific guidelines, which doesn't allow students to expand their thinking and express their knowledge in a way they would like to. Summer school projects should be student-designed because it allows students to show their own creativity, the students would put in effort with something they are passionate about, and teacher-led projects are too basic.\n \n Lamar Jackson and LeBron James strive in their respective sports for one reason, their style. If every athlete were to shoot the basketball the same way, or throw the football the same way, then there would be no point in watching the games! These sporting events are exciting because every athlete has their own style of play. The same could be said in the classroom. If every student in a class presented a slide showÂ or an essay for their project, I bet the teacher would fall asleep in an instant! Student-designed projects gives the opportunity for the students to really show their creativity and understanding in a way that is special to them. For example, a student who has musical talent could write a song about their project, or an athlete could make a game for their project. The options are endless!

Teacher-designed projects don't give the opportunity for students to really show how well they understand the topic. Repetition in the classroom is very toxic. Having the same boring project guideline for every student doesn't engage the students in any way at all. The student-designed projects show diversity and creativity; on the other hand, teacher-designed projects are extremely dull and unoriginal. The teacher-designed projects have such a strict rubric that makes the students roll their eyes. The biggest flaw of it all is that the students are only trying to satisfy the teacher, rather than trying to fully comprehend the subject.\n \n When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. In the classroom, students would put in a tremendousÂ amount of effort if they were given the chance to do a project in their own way. Whenever I get a project assigned, I tell myself that I will start working on it the next day. If I were able to put my own twist on a project, I might be able to finish the whole assignment in one day!\n \n The way Carlos Santana strums a guitar is iconic and infamous; no other living creature can imitate his style. In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting. A teacher-designed project is a vanilla ice cream cone, while a student-designed project is an ice cream cone with nuts, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.Â",

    essay:
      "Summer, as known throughout the whole world, is for relaxation. Now when it comes to students, summer is a school free zone, mentally and physically. Though some teachers believe it is a smart idea to give the students projects or summer reading so they wouldn't forget some of the school work and already have a review over the summer when they come back. That is always expected when schools start back, though not all the students that were assigned to do the assignments did them because they either didn't understand the task correctly or they just wanted to enjoy summer and not think about any school work. That causes both the students and the teachers to be irritated and dissapointed. However, that could be changed by just one small upgrade.\n \n For years, school systems and teachers have been assigning students lessons that they will either never use in the real life or lessons the students don't understand or don't want to learn because the topics don't interest them. Many studies have shown the peak of the students grades is when they are being taught about modern day conflicts or societies, or just topics that interest them. That shows the students want to learn about what relates to them or something they actually want to learn about. Also, some students want to actually earn their grade. As surprising as it is, students want to do their work, because they want to be happy when they get the \"A\" and say that they deserved it because they worked hard on the assignment. Though not all of them can do that because not all of them might understand the assignment. Here, is where the upgrading comes in handy.\n \n School systems need to find new ways of education and renew all of the \"traditional\" ways of teaching. The systems need to understand that these generations are becoming more complicated to teach because of all the new modern trends and technologies. It is becoming easier for the students to understand the lessons from their peers and not the teachers, because it is becoming more difficult each day for the teachers to connect with their students. That is usually either because of social distractions or lack of good communication between the teacher and their students. Though if the teachers and the systems started renovating and thinking about new ways such as: letting the students choose their own topics of what they want to do for summer projects. They can just start from the summer projects, start it off small and see how much of an effect that will make and if it comes out with a pretty positive effect then take action during the actual school months.\n \n Every student does not wish or even want to keep having bad grades in school. Especially because of minor things or because they think they are not smart enough to succeed like their peers. Taking effect in letting students choose what they want to do for their summr projects will make a huge imapct on how the students will learn when they go back to school. That will also affect how the school systems view students learning and will see that it's the best choice to start upgrading their teaching system to the more modern ways. Students will want to actually do their assingments because they will know what they are do it and actually understand it. They will even enjoy what they are doing because they know they will do good because they worked hard on what they are doing.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

      "Students may be assigned projects from their instructors over summer break. This task can be rather frustrating, time consuming, and confusing when made by a teacher. Students have different lives with different perspectives from one another and their teacher. Students may even have a better understanding when a fellow student-peer explains rather than a teacher. Summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed.\n \n If students were to design a summer project, they'd think of the best way to relate to others and compromise to obtain the best connection with others. Students know that others think differently and go to various locations over break, however; it wouldn't exclude them from the assignment, but rather work toward their schedule as planned and give them a topic for a project. This would mean students don't have to consume lots of time researching, won't haveÂ trouble completing the assignment, and have fun on break with this student made project that reflects back on, \"Your Summer Vacation\", for example.\n \n Each students see things different from each other and teachers as well. Teachers can be one sided and assign things based off what they think is best for their students, furthermore; this may not be true because students don't think or see like teachers. Students have a huge variety of different perspective on things. So, a project created by students would fit better because of all the ideas sparked up would come together and be at everyone's benefit and not just one specific person. Teachers tend to confuse students with the way they word things at times, where as students have a better understanding of one another and all there different ideas they brainstorm as well. Also, students may have more in common rather than with their teachers because they're more likely influenced by the same stuff that's around their age group like things such as: music, television, social media, and/ or video games.\n \n Many different times there has been students who fail to complete projects assigned by their instructors because of how overwhelming the directions were or how hard it was to process. Students will want the best understanding for each other because we know what's difficult and what is moderate work. Teachers sometimes expect students to do things they can't do on a project; if a student were to design a project, it would get straight to the point and tell you exactly what you need to do in order to complete the task correctly and not wrong while being away from school during the summer. Students also understand that they may even would want to work in a group, especially if there away for break so they can help each otherÂ out possibly, but teachers only allow it to to be one person where it may be more challenging without the help of them being at school. Students on break don't want to have to spend their time working on stuff for school, that's why if students made a project, it would educate but not interfere with their freedom,so everybody wins, both teachers and students.\n \n Overall, students don't look toward to doing summer projects, they'd rather go places and have fun with friends and family. However; the task might as well be a fun, student-organized project that is planned to help gain knowledge during break. The results of this would be that students are still learning while they enjoy themselves and not stressing over not being able to understanding what there doing. With the addition of the help from their parents too, students would put in a format where anyone who reads the instructions, knows exactly what to do. Student-designed projects would be the best way for students to learn over summer.Â",

      "Throughout our school career's projects are often assigned to extend learning during the summer break. Summer projects are more often created by teachers. These projects are rather extensive due to the months that are given to complete it. Those who may opposeÂ state that it is the teachers job to create these summer assignments and they are able to bring more structureÂ to the project. Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true.\n \n Students creating their own summer projects can benefit them as students. Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed. After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next. Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students. Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work. Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project. Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again. Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass. Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions. If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year. Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them. Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning.\n \n Through creating their own assignments, students are able to build qualities that are helpful in a work environment. The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticismÂ can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that isÂ helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with schoolÂ assignments this skill can be applied to any work place.\n \n Summer projects can help extend learning outside of school during summer break. Through students creating their own summer project there is a better understanding of the project but also an excitement to complete it. Having created their project a sense of control over students learning can be gained which is often lost throughout the school year. Those who oppose may state that teachers should create summer projects because they have more experience than students and that teachers are able to introduce new topics to students. Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning.",

      "Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?\n \n During summer break some schools require teachers to give out summer projects to assure that students continue to learn while on vacation. Even though students may not enjoy getting it done, it gives the teacher feedback on how well you are learning in the summertime. These projects are either teacher-designed or student designed. While teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages, summer projects need to be student-designed so that it is less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster.\n \n When projects are teacher-designed, teachers will usually design them as more difficult to do so that it can give their students a challenge to do better. This technique is often done by teachers but what they do not realize is that when teachers design projects that are more challenging it is much harder on the student to understand, let alone get the project done. On the other hand, some students may be out of the country the whole summer so giving them teacher-designed projects that are challenging will give them a harder time for them to learn or get the assignment done.\n \n In the past I have had a very hard time getting most of my projects done because of lack of motivation and because of the way teachers design certain projects. If students are the ones to design it, it will increase the amount of students who do the project because they are the ones who are designing it. In addition making it much more easier for them to understand and get the project done. If summer projects are student-designed, students will not have to use the excuse of not getting the project done because they \"didn't understand it\", instead their will be no excuse because they are the ones who to designed it, not the teacher.\n \n Most students work a lot faster than others because of lack of understanding. Although teachers may not even realize it, they design these projects in ways in which students will often have a hard time with having at least some progress done because they simply do not know where to begin. When the student is the one who is able to design it, it allows them to have the opportunity to decide what to include and what not to, so that it makes their learning easier. In addition, having summer projects be student-designed allows them to work twice as faster than using teacher-designed projects because the student is the one that knows what they have to include.\n \n In conclusion teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages but all projects need to be student-designed because at the end of the day the student is the one who is learning. All projects should be student-designed for these reasons: less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster. Summer projects that are student-designed instead of teacher-designed ensures that the student is more likely to succeed. In addition teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages but all projects need to be student-designed because at the end of the day the student is the one who is learning. Â",

      "Schools across the country have been implementing a method that ensures that students continue learning during their break, this method is: Summer projects. Summer projects are usually teacher-designed and inconvenientÂ for a majority of students over the summer. There has been a great debate whether or not summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed, I personally think they should be designed by students.\n \n Often times when students are assigned summer projects they are incapable of completing them due to vacations or other activities. Students should design summer projects because they know what they are capable of completing. Some students have jobs, sports, or volunteering, which do not give them ample time to compete their summer projects. In eighth grade, I was tasked with a summer assignment, but I couldn't complete it because half of the time I either did not have internet connection or I was too busy exploring new places. If I had designed my own summer project that year, I would have been able to complete it due to the fact that I know my own schedule and capabilities\n \n If summer projects are student-designed it would be more enjoyable for students. Students know what methods bore them and what methods do not; students can omit the methods that bore them and replace them with a more interactive methods. On the contrary, teachers are more experienced with creating projects, can ensure students are learning what is required, and know exactly what curriculumÂ should be in summer projects.\n \n Student-designed summer projects give students more incentive to complete them; they are more interactive and cater to students. Student-designed summer projects would be flexible and easier to comprehend for students. Ask yourself, would you want to plan your summer or let a project plan it for you?",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students should design these projects to let the teacher see how creative students can be. Also to show the diffrent ways students can use their mind to comlete the project in the course of the their break. In some cases students will not want to do any work over their break, but if these students can design the assignment and do what ever project they want to do they will be willing to do the work. Furthermore, students being able to design a project for the course of summer break will help students learn how to complete a task they assign themelves and will help students be able to set goals and accomplish them in the future.\n \n This form of learning can assist students in being creative and opening up the mind to new things. Those qualitys help expand the information you know and can benefit you in the long run. These things form a intellegent mind thats why I feel its a need to try and do new things to learn. For example, there was a time when I was told by a teacher to try a new method in reading that I come up with because she said thats something to make you remember what youve just learned ,and ever since then I have always been open to new things and ideas when it comes to coming up with a new way of learning. Therefore, I always try to incourage others to do the same because its something that strenghtings you, opens the mind, and makes you a smarter individual.\n \n Using your mind in diffrent ways stimulates students brains and Creates new pathways for information to be shared. This is a way to get a better understanding of ways you can look at certain situations as a student. For instance, you might not like the way things are going in class but if you were to sit and think of better ways to handle the problem it will show you that thinking in diffrent ways can make a problem a blessing you just have to be willing to put forth the effort. trying is better than not trying and that can make a big diffrence in your life and how you live it. It takes being diverse on how you think to become a great student.\n \n Students creating their own project for their summer break is one of the best things you can get a student to do because they have to think and use diffrent ideas to complete a assignment that they choose. Its important to understand the importance of this because it will give them something to do to remember what they learned from school in the past year while they are on summer break, so they can't forget any information that is needed for years to come. Also will be alot easier for them to accomplish things in the future due to working in the summer nights through school and this will highly benefit the students and their future. Thats the reason I think this will be beneficial to anyone who attempts.\n \n Another reason is that it will prepare the students for a heavy work load in years to come. For example, being in highschool and later going on to college is not just a walk in the park its hard days and long nights to accomplish something bigger. Students doing this at a young age will have them ready for the highschool and college lifestyle. Also will give them something they can never loose and thats the dicipline you get from doing obstacles like this because it keeps you from getting distracted and helps you focus harder on the project and they all starts with you aswell so its the dicipline you aquire from doing things like that.\n \n In conclusion, students are required to design their own project they are to complete over the course of summer and create it by themselves. I agree with this because it can give the students important qualities that they only can get from doing something like a self made project and can benefit them for their future. Doing certain things in life are only to help you learn and grow and doing a project like this will help you be able to multitask and do things a different way then you see everyone else doing. Therefore students designing their own projects can help and benefit them to be a better individuals in the future.

    essay:
      "Studies have proven that schools that assign projects and assignments for their students to work on over the summer have seen a much higher success rate in the upcoming school year than if they didn't assign anything. To students, summer projects are not their ideal way to spend their summer and they often procrastinate until the end of the school year. Some projects may be really fun and interesting, but others may be thick packets of mindless busy work that can really take the fun out of summer vacation. Although teachers are around students all of the time, they still have some blind spots as to how they learn the best and what will encourage them to get their work done. If the summer projects that the students are assigned were to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed, there would be a much higher completion rate, less blame on the teacher for the project, and the projects would be better suited to match the students knowledge on the subject.\n \n To start, student-designed summer projects would lead to a higher completion rate. The students would feel more compelled to complete their projects knowing that they were the ones to design it. There's something different about doing something someone else made and is forcing you to do rather than something you took the time to make that you know you will understand when you work on it. For example, you work at a business with a group of people and you were all individually assigned to create a plan of how the company would take on a new project. After you all have presented your separate ideas you've worked really hard on, your boss chooses this other guy's plan over yours. For the next few months, you now have to work on his plan with him controlling everything are doing, which is miserable. If your plan was the one to be chosen, you would have a much better attitude towards working on this plan because you were the one to design it. This scenario works the same with students and teachers. Students don't like being given work during the time that they're supposed to not worry about school, especially when they have no control over the matter. This is the first reason why summer projects should be student-designed.\n \n To add, if summer projects were student-designed, students would be a lot less upset at their teachers for giving them work over the summer. When they go to start working on their projects, they will know what to be expecting, so they won't be blindsided with difficult curriculum that they will spend hours trying to figure out while they are resenting their teachers for making them that stressed over the summer. If they are the ones to design it, they cannot blame their teachers for anything, and they most likely won't find a reason to blame anyone. It would definitely be a good idea to have the teachers set a general level of information they have to know for the upcoming school year so that they don't have the students designing their summer projects with information they already learned in previous years. This way, the teachers will be happy because the students are learning the information they want them to learn, and the students will also be happy because they had control over how they got to complete their work.\n \n Lastly, student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to design the curriculum given to them in a way that they can understand and complete the assignment to their best ability. Some teachers can tend to over estimate their students ability and knowledge of a subject, so only the students can truly know their own ability and know what will help them be able to understand the material the most. At the end of the day, the goal of the summer assignment is to keep students learning during their break and give them an introduction into what they will be learning about in their next school year. Allowing the students to design the projects will most likely achieve this goal better than if a teacher were to design it. For example, math is one of the subjects that students tend to struggle with the most, and giving them an assignment with material on it that they are unfamiliar with because it's something they will learn next school year is not beneficial, especially if they do not have a teacher with them to ask questions. If the student designs it, they will be able to take the topics given to them by their teachers and include links to websites such as Khan Academy to help themselves with it over the summer. Overall, students know what works best for them and they are the ones completing the work, so the least the school can do for them is allow them to design their own summer projects.\n \n In conclusion, summer projects are beneficial to students in their preparation for the upcoming school year; however, giving the students the opportunity to design their projects will lead to more success over the teacher-designed projects. Students being more likely to complete something they designed, taking away the blame students would normally put on teachers, and students knowing their own ability and knowledge are three out of the many reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Ultimately, it would be ideal for both students and teachers to work together on designing the projects so that the students know what the teacher is looking for and the teachers can understand what the students are able to do; however, the students should have more control of the projects because they are the ones completing the projects, and it is their future that is being affected.Â",

      "A start to a new beginning. Last summer a group of friends and I, started a summer program. A program where kids can learn different things, different ways to do things, and of course have fun. We built things such as, wooden boats, wooden hats, and wooden cars. We showed them different ways to do project. For fun we took the kids swimming, hiking, and fishing. At the end my friends and I got great feedback from the kids and their parents. With my friends and I taking on such as big program like that, showed me that any child could do whatever they wanted to, if they put their mind to it. That is why I think it is a great idea for students to design; because, they could come up with fun things to do, could be able to show others what they are able to do without a teacher's help, and they would already know what people their age like to talk about and work on.\n \n First, most students have great imaginations. That can cause them to come up with great, fun, and differentÂ things to do. Such as using 3D objects, using liquids, and maybe even using things from nature. Those different things can really get someone attention.\n \n Second, there may be someone that is trying their best to show everyone what they can do. Designing a project can be great way to prove themselves. That way when they finish designing, they are able to show everyone. That student would be able to call themselves a great independent worker.\n \n Third, when students are let out for the summer; they do not want to do thing involving school work. Having a student design the project can make sure it is on something that would make them want to work on something related to school. It will be something different for the kids. They will be doing something instructive, as their summer goes by.\n \n In conclusion, student designed would be the best choice. Some people might say teacher design would be best but I disagree. I beg you to consider my opinion.Â",

      "School projects are required for students at certain schools to complete over the summer to prove that they are still learning over their break. The summer projects should be student designed, because they are not in school at the time. If the teachers want to assign a project to the students for a period that they are not enrolled in the school system, they can atleast throw the ball into the students court on where to take it from there. As long as the student sticks to the theme of the project. A project to show you're learning something like the one in this case, can be taken through many different routes.\n \n Summer is a school vacation. When most schools let out for the break, they don't hold the students accountable for any school work. Unless say you were participating in home school, which would be a different story. Although this school inparticular has a different prespective by wanting the reassurance that their students are not brain-washed throughout the next couple months off. Assigning a simple tasks to show your teacher that you have really learned something, is not bad when student-designed, as long as kept within appropriate boundaries. When you get assigned something, with the choice to choose where you go from there, you will result in a better outcome. Learning something that you are curious, or excited about will give you a whole different experience. When something intrests you, you gain motivation.\n \n If the teachers had chose to design a project for the students, it would most likley be a clique. Im thinking thick stacks of paper you have to read through, by following up questions and writting. There is already enough of that work in school. If that is what the school would be going for with the summer project, they might as well find a way to cancel summer out completely. Being a pupil myself I know that as soon as I walk out of those school doors, I'm free for the next couple months. If you throw a stack of paper work at me at that time, I'm most likley to hold off, or forget about it copletely. As for i had just got released from that type of routine. Throwing extreme school paperwork at me as soon as I get free from that, doesn't make the most sense. If thats the case, cancel out summer completely, because the tradition of summer is a school vacaction.\n \n Say you simply hand the students a one sheet of paper stating that they need to come back into the next school year, exhibiting that they learned something intresting or new over the summer, you will get better outcome. Once you release the kids from the school, especially for summer you are not going to get the same energy out of most of them. If they are not enrolled at the time, the bottom line is that they really do not owe you anything. Giving pupils that freedom, then throwing what they are getting away from right back at them is not the way to go with this. Doing that, a lot of kids will have no desire nor care at all to complete that task. Summer is about chill and good vibes. Throw something simple but effective at the students, then you tell me if you achieve a good outcome in return .",

      "Students after a long and rested summer break usually come back to school in August forgettingÂ what they learned the previous year. To assure that students continue to learn over their break they should be able to make their own project instead of having a teacher designed project.\n \n Summer projects should be student designed as it provides more creativity and freedom in their work, as well as it shows that they understand the given content by the teacher, but the project may not be easy to understand and complete compared to a teacher designed project.\n \n A student designed project over Summer break creates creativity in the students because they would have to break their boundaries in order to discover what they need to create in their project. Students will also have more freedom because they will be able to chose their topics based on their own interest. This allows students to be excited to learn during their summer break; for example, if they are allow to choose what their project will be based about they will be more productive and continue to learn more as they will have an interest in their work unlike a teacher designed project that students might disagree on and become less productive to a topic that creates noÂ satisfaction towards the students. That is terrible for the schools when students arrive back to school over break as they would not have learn as much because their topic was not interestingÂ and maybe some would choose not to complete the teacher designed project because of the topic.\n \n Allowing students to create their own project also visualizes that they understood their teacher content, by taking their teacher content and combining it to their own ideas into a project that shows the teacher that the students still remembers what they learn over summer break. While a teacher design project does not show if a student fully understand the content because every student will all have the same ideas and will be unable to show what new content they learned over the summer.\n \n Because student gets to work on their interests which may be different then what they learn in their school year, they wouldÂ have to do research to learn new topics that they never could have done with a teacher design project. A teacher project would not need to research new topics as they would just need to revise on what they learned over the school year. Thats why a student design project is better for learning for when they return back to school they would've had learned new content.\n \n A teacher designed project is the least choice for a summer project. Although, it does have its own benefits such as being less stressful on students to work on this project because they will already know the basics and what to do for the project. They would be able to work together helping student understand the content more; for example, they would look over each other work making sure that they understand that they are doing the project correctly. Teacher designed project allows student to refresh and review what they learned during the school year over Summer break, that a student design project will be unable to accomplish due to the fact that teacher designed project is mainly about what they already learn instead of expanding into new topics.\n \n In order to allow students to learn over their Summer break they would need student designed project to allow them to learn new things while also giving them more creativity that will help them out when they return to school. The student design allows for opportunity for the students to choose what they might want to do in the future and interest while a teacher design is not fully capable of doing the same. Allowing student designed project will help schools and student grow and learn while they are on break so that they don't come back to school forgetting main topics and having to waste time relearning such topics.",

    essay:
      "Over summer, many students are required to do a project pertaining to a specific class. The projects given, should be teacher-designed rather than the student creating his or her own idea. The project should be teacher-designed because the project gives an outline to the student on what will be taught that school year. It also helps the student determine officially, if he or she would like to stay in that specific class and as well as, express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be, based on the effort given on the summer project. If teachers continue to design the projects, there will be more success within the classroom and the work ethic given by students.\n \n When teachers give a summer assignment, the work given helps a student see the type of material he or she will be learning that year. The work comes to show how rigorous the class and classwork will be based off of the work load and in depth questions that the teacher has provided. With receiving an outline, it gives the overall idea of what to expect, so that the student can mentally prepare, for the upcoming year. When being able to prepare ahead of time, the student will be able to see the amount of work that might be given. Without the teacher-designed summer project, the student will be oblivious to what to expect in the class that they will be taking.\n \n Continuing on, a teacher-designed project, helps express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be receiving, based off of the effort given on the project. When a teacher designs a project, it is usually a reflection of how hard that specific class is and type of teacher he or she might happen to be. If the student happens to only complete the bare minimum or does not even try, it shows that, that student may not be best suit in that teacher's class. With the teacher giving a personal designed project, it shows which students have the initiative and will work hard on any assignment given, moving forward. The project overall gives a central idea to the teacher, on what he or she needs to expect during the future of the school year.\n \n Many claim that not letting a student design their own project, takes away from his or her creativity and own personal ideas. However, the point of someone expressing creativity, is being able to take anything and make it their own. A student can still be creative and express themselves through the work given by the teacher. Having the ability to express his or her own ideas and meet the requirements, will stand out to any teacher evaluating it. Just because the range of ideas and creativity is limited when the student is not able to create his or her own project, does not mean creativity or personal ideas are completely shut out and prevented from being intertwined within the teacher's design.\n \n Overall, having a teacher-designed project is more efficient and much more beneficial than one that is student-designed. When having a project designed by a teacher, it is a way for a student to see how hard and rigorous the class will be and the abundance of work that will be given throughout the rest of the school year. Not only that, but it as well gives teachers the overall idea on what will be expected of specific students and the standards that will need to be upheld the upcoming year. Without the teacher-designed projects, the students will not know what to complete a project on and will not be ready at all, for what they will be learning the upcoming year. Teacher-designed projects are a great idea and will be a great addition, for all students to have the ability to be prepared, for the upcoming school year.Â  Â Â Â",
