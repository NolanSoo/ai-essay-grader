    ESSAY:
      "Have you ever wondered where your best friend was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.\n\nSigning up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve racking but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.\n\nTheres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.\n\nSometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.\n\nMy first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.   ",

    ESSAY:
      "Our principle has recently stated to all the students of SCHOOL_NAME that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity. Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.\n\nMusical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.\n\nMusical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.\n\nAnother great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.\n\nFinally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.\n\nI stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.          ",

      "Students should be able to choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not for many reasons. Most students are busy and don't want added pressure on top of school work. While kids may want to do extraculliculars they may do out of school activities that can take up their time, or they might have a family to take care of. Many students also a lot of time for homework, which they won't get the time for in an extracurricular.\n\nA reason students student's may not want to do an extracurricular is because they might have out of school obligations. If a student was babysitting or tutoring someone, they wouldn't have time to do extraculliculars because they'd be busy doing another job. It would be unfair to force someone who has another job to do more work, which is why they should have the choice to do an extracurricular activity.\n\nFurthermore, some students could have a family to take care of when they get home. For example, if a student has a younger sibling that needs to be picked up from the bus stop, the student would have to help with that. If they were forced to do an extracurricular, they wouldn't have time to take care of their sibling.\n\nIn addition, quite a few students would need more time to do homework, which an extracurricular would prevent them from doing. While some students can finish their homework quickly and have enough time for another activity, a student who takes a long time shouldn't be rushed into doing something else. If they need more time to do their homework, they shouldn't be dragged into doing an activity.\n\nIn conclusion, students have out of school activities, family to take care of, and a lot of homework which can make it hard for them to focus on extracurricular activities on top of it. All in all, there are many reasons a student might not want to do an extracurricular. Because of this, a student should be able to have a choice to do another activity or not.",

    ESSAY:
      "Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.\n\nRequiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social. Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.\n\nThese activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.\n\nAnother benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students. When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.\n\nIn conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",

    ESSAY:
      "Does sitting inside and doing nothing but homework and chores all day sound exciting? Or would you rather have an opportunity to do fun activities with other people, making friends and improving your health along the way? If the latter sounds like the more appealing option, than you should support our principal's decision to make taking an extracurricular program mandatory. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is the perfect choice for our school. That is because it opens up new and unexpected opportunities, provides an outlet to make new friends, and helps improve your physical and mental well being.\n\nYou should support the requirement of an extracurricular because it opens up fun and enjoyable activities that you might not have come across if not for this new policy. A very sporty kid might never know that he really enjoys being on the student council unless he tries it, and it is unlikely that he would try it any other way. The same thing works inversely, a book-smart kid could really have a great time playing basketball or football and never know it unless he tries it. The new opportunities can also help your in-school life by helping you learn about certain topics that you are struggling in or by providing service hours to contribute towards your required amount. The activity would also be a place to go every time you would rather not go home or if you just preferred to stay after school with your friends.\n\nThe same way that this policy provides an outlet to new activities that you might not have found otherwise, it also paves the way to making you friends that you wouldn't have been friends with in any other situation. If you are a new addition to a certain group and you feel lost with how much more accustomed everyone else is to the group, you could make friends with an elder statesmen type of the group, in a mentor-apprentice kind of way. Many times, you could find people who are in the same situation that you are. If you got to know them and started working together with them, you could both benefit by learning how the group works. Overall, it would just be a fantastic way to gain friends, especially with people who are having a hard time getting to know new people.\n\nAnother great way that this program is going to help is how it improves your physical and mental health. School can get very stressful at times, and the amount of homework, studying, test-taking, and other school things on top of the everyday teenage problems that you have can start to feel draining, like a heavy weight being pushed down on you. Extracurricular programs relieve a lot of that stress by being a place where you can slow down a little bit and be more involved in things you actually enjoy being involved in. The physical activities, such as baseball or basketball, are a great place to get some exercise in to improve your physical life. A lot of students this age have it rough in that they might not have a lot of friends or people to talk to, so just a simple activity like the yearbook club could help relieve an immense amount of emotional weight off of that student by actually giving them someone to talk about their problems to.\n\nThe intelligent choice by our principal to make at least one extracurricular program mandatory is an incredibly beneficial choice to all who are involved. It is a policy that gives people new chances to find something that they like doing, helps students make friends with people that they likely wouldn't have otherwise, and improves the physical and mental health of those students who need the improvement. If you are for the well-being of students and the developmental growth of the people who are the future of our nation, then you should be for this policy. ",

      "Do you ever wish that you could have the chance to do a fun activity during or after school? Some schools are making students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can start new friendships, and in could be fun.\n\nDoing extracurricular activities can start new friendships. If you find someone with the same interest as you, then you two may become friends. It can be hard for people to meet new friends, but if you find someone with a similar interest then it could be easier to become friends with them. Secondly you guys could do activities together. If you two were to both to play an instrument, then you could practice together. Doing an extracurricular activity could give you topics to talk about with friends. If your at lunch one day and you run out of things to talk about, your extracurricular activity could be a good topic. If you miss out on an opportunity for an extracurricular activity, then you could be missing out on an amazing friendship\n\nParticipating in extracurricular activities could be fun. first off there are field trips. Why wouldn't you want to skip a day of school and hang out with friends on a fun field trip? Also you get to do something you enjoy. It can give you a little extra time doing what you love. Lastly it can open up new opportunities. Things like band and orchestra may have festivals or auditions that you could do. Extracurricular activities can give you lots of chances to have fun, and enjoy school a little more.\n\nHowever, some people may say that students will lose interest. They say picking the wrong topic could lead to a year of being board. This could make students dislike the class or not want to go to it. Although, most students say that they enjoy their extracurricular activity, and even if its not their favorite class, they don't dread going to it. For example if a student liked science class more than yearbook, that doesn't mean that the student doesn't want to go to school. But if a student really didn't like the class, then they would know in the future not to pick it again. It would at the least give a student direction on if they would want to do that activity again. Even though people say that kids will lose interest in the activity they choose, students will always be able to get something out of it.\n\nHaving to do an extracurricular activity could lead to new friendships and a year of fun. Being able to experience a extracurricular activity can be a great way to open yourself up to new things, and try different activities. You'll never know what you missed out on if you don't take an extracurricular activity. ",

      "Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity such as a sport or a club. I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because it helps build friendships, raise your low grades, and allows you to experience new things.\n\nThe first reason after school activities are beneficial is that they can build a strong and lasting friendship. I remember when I was in elementary school and my mom signed me up for after school basketball. The first few days and even weeks I hated it. I had no friends there or even someone I had seen before. I was scared and shy. Most of the kids were way older than me and looked huge. Most days I sit on the sideline watching them, wishing I could be that good. Suddenly the tallest kid of them all walks up to me and asked if I would like to join them in a game. I was in shocked and happy at the same time. I told the boy I would love to join. every day after that for three years I played with them after school. Eventually me and that boy became best friends and didnt do anything without each other. We played basketball together, watched movies, played cops and robbers, and had sleepovers. Five years later we are still best friends.\n\nThe second reason after school activities are beneficial is because they can help raise your grades and test scores. Studies show that students who participate in homework clubs and study clubs generally have higher test scores. This means the students who have higher grades can get into better colleges, and students in better colleges can get higher paying jobs. From just attending after school homework clubs students have already made a step towards their goals of getting a good high paying job to support their family.\n\nThe third reason after school activites are beneficial is because they allow students to experience new things. At my middle school we have so many different clubs and activities that everyone can find something they enjoy. I wish I could experience every single club we have but that is just not possible. Before I joined the cooking club I could only use a microwave and toaster. The amazing teacher taught me how to bake and make really fancy dishes for family gatherings or holidays. Before this class my Mom and Grandma cooked for Christmas. Now that I am able to help it feels wonderful because it is more time that I can use to bond with my family and friends.\n\nIn conclusion I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because they are great places to build friendships, improve your grades, and experience new things.       ",

      '"Good morning students, this is your morning announcements. This is your principle speaking. I would like to make an announcement that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity this year. Thank you for listening." "That sounds like a great idea. I can do track this year," I said. "I can do drama club this year," said the girl that sat behind me. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.\n\nMaking friends is something that everyone wants to do during the school year. While playing a sport, you can make good friends, and do the sport you really like. When I did track last year, I made many great friends. The friends you make in school, might have a chance to grow up to still being one of your best friends. Making new friends can help increase your social life and have someone to talk to. Studies show that people that have many friends, tend to live longer, and have a happier life. But people that have don\'t have any friends, shows that they don\'t live as long. Doing clubs can also have a chance to make many friends. By doing drama club, theater club, or a robotics club, new people that you meet might have the same interests as you, and the two can share things they like to do and do as a hobby. This creates bonds with other people and groups. These bonds can eventually create friendships.\n\nDoing sports in something people really like to do as a hobby. They can be physical sports or non-physical sports that they can participate in. People also like to be active in clubs such as the yearbook club, drama club, or even the robotics club. Extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and active, so students can have fun. Competing in sports is something athletes enjoy because of the competition with the other teams, and to see who is the better team. Clubs also compete with other clubs, including the robotics club. They build their machine, and then they compete to see which school has the better machine. Being active in activities would be fun for all students because they involve students being active and having them do fun activities.\n\nBy doing many activities may spark someones mind that they want to do what they want in the future. If a student does drama club or theater in school, they might try out for the activity in high school, or do a play as their career. If a student plays football in middle school, they might try out in high school and get a scholarship to play in college. Then, they can get drafted into the NFL as their career. It\'s a hard task, but anything you put your mind to, you can do it. If the student doe not want to play a sport, be in the yearbook club, or do drama, they can run for student council. This may have the student want to run for student council and win. Running for student council includes many things you would to in other activities, including competition, planning,and confidence. This may have the student be interested in politics. They could even run for an election when they grow up.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it would be a great idea for the principal to have all student participate in extracurricular activities. In addition, I was on the track team for two years an I made many friends because of trying out. I also got to learn more about sports and I know many people would want to do these activities for a career. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.            ',

      "The Principal is making all the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity and while some people may think that this is the greatest thing,and that they are going to love it,others may think that this was a huge mistake and that they won't do any good for them. I think that people need to try an extracurricular activity to get a feel for it. Sure some students may try out for a sports team or a team in general,but they are never finding out their true potential and will leave it in the dust. I think the Principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity because you can make friends,find something you didn't know you were good at till now,and make a living out of it.\n\nThe principal should let everyone take a extra curricular activity is because you can make new friends. You can make new friends by talking to the people in your activity. You can find people and become friends by talking to them,becoming really close to them,and becoming friendly with them. You can also find people that you have in common. There's people that I have met that have the same likes,interests,and dislikes,and we became really great friends just by having a few things in common,so you guys should try finding someone and seeing if you have a lot of things in common with him or her. You can also find your future best friend or your soon to be best friend. You can find a person,hit it off with them,and become best friends in the long run just because of that one extra curricular activity. In conclusion I think you can make new friends in a extra curricular activity by being friendly,finding people who have the same likes and dislikes as you,and find a best friend.\n\nAnother reason the Principal should let students take one extra curricular activity because you might find something you didn't know you were good at. You can find something you didn't know you were good at because of the many options that schools have. Over fifty activities in schools around the world! From basketball,soccer,and football,form even cooking. Schools have something that might suit you. So if you don't like soccer or any sports,there's always cooking or Cosmetics. You can make teams and become popular and active. For sports such as soccer and softball,you can make the teams and get popular making a lot of friends in the process. You can make money by trying out for a sport. Once you get into high school,you can earn credits and even a college application which saves a lot of money. I think we should take an extracurricular activity because they have many options,you can be active and popular,and you can make or save money.\n\nI think everyone should take at least one extra curricular activity because you can become know for the best basketball or best soccer player one day. Kobe Bryant and Micheal Jordan are perfect examples of people who started in basketball in probably high school as a extra curricular activity,to one of the Greatest players of all time. On the other Extra curricular activity come off as useless and left in the dust. People just take it for granted and just want the easy A.They don't try to discover their true potential and leave it in the dust. I think that an extra curricular activity is fun and may or may not get you famous,but on the other hand people just seem to abuse it's power.\n\nIn conclusion I think that the principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity just because if how fun it is. Taking an extra curricular activity means that you can make new friends and best friends,do something that you didn't know you were good at till now and become popular and active,and be famous just like other famous people around the globe. But one the other hand people just seem to not care. In conclusion I think that the principle should let students take at least one extra curricular activity but not make it a rule so that other people will not feel uncomferable and forced to take an extra curricular activity.",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine if you had to do an extracurricular activity at school with no say otherwise. Extracurricular activities are meant for a fun, optional, learning experience. Most schools offer activities for student interests. Students like the option of extracurricular activities because they can participate in their interests if they want to but it isn't mandatory like most other things in school. I disagree that students should be forced to do extracurricular activities because students should have the choice of what they want to do, most students are busy with other things outside of school, and students may not be interested in what their school offers.\n\nStudents shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because they should have the choice of what they want to do. Schools offer activities so students can participate in things they want do, not have to do. Being forced to participate in things a student doesn't want to do can stress them out. Most things in school are mandatory so students like not feeling the pressure of being forced to do something. Making students participate in extracurricular activities can have benefits too. It would make them go out and do something and help them learn new skills. In the end multiple downsides outweighs a few benefits. While there may be benefits to forcing students to go and do something, in the end they should have their own choice of what they want to do or not do.\n\nAnother reason why students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities is because most students are already busy with other things outside of school. Forcing more upon them would stress them out and make them dislike school. Students already dread each night they go home because of all their homework so making them have even more to do will over stress them leading to depression and lack of effort. While it is good to challenge students to help them find their full potential, overworking them can lead to problems with their health and efforts during school. Extracurricular activities are supposed to make learning fun and help students learn new skills, not make them dread every day of school. Overworking students when they are already busy leads to anxiety and stress which is why extracurricular activities shouldn't be mandatory.\n\nThe last reason why schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities is because some students may not be interested in what their school offers. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students discover what their interests are, not force them to do things they don't care for. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students know what they might be interested in doing in the future. If a student doesn't have interest in any of their schools options, they shouldn't be forced to do them. Some students may only have interests in things they can't do at their school. While some students might have interests that their school offers, not everyone does making it unfair for everyone to have to do an activity. If schools make students do things they don't want to, they will start questioning if their schools cares about their opinion or interests.\n\nIn the end, students should have the choice of whether or not they want to do extracurricular activities since some are busy with other things and others aren't interested in what is offered. Overall, I have proved why I think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. Between being forced to do extracurricular activities and having a choice, having a choice is definitely the right answer. I chose that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they should be able to make their own choices, even if it isn't always the best answer.",

      "I agree because maybe it could lead to new friendships or relate able things or a thing with a teacher. For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activities or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decided to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do. Sometimes your parents might force you do to some activities at school or outside of school it's because they want you to feel like you've like accomplished everything in life and you've decided to try something new for once and will actually enjoy it and stick to it as long as you live or until you quit or retire. You might even find your furture date and be very distance get to know each other so I am agreeing because it causes friendships doesn't have to be home all day and some thing you might like.",

      "Sometimes, students all they want to do, is be on their phones all day and do nothing,i would recommend that students join an activity they enjoy, and effects them in their future career. In that case, I agree with the principal's decision, that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons for my decision are students can become more successful,and they can prepare for what they want to be when they grow up.\n\nMy first reason is, students can be more successful, and by that i mean better grades. nowadays kids grades drop really low because they are late to class,skip school,or don't pay attention, young teenagers miss a lot of information given by their teacher by not doing what they are supposed to. Staying after school with teachers can catch them up with their work, and help them achieve better goals.\n\nHowever,activities can prepare young adults, for what they want to be went they grow up. If the student want's to be a professional player they might as well join a sport and practice new skills. Or if a students want to be a chef like the pionneer woman that sells pans and utensils,they could join a cooking class after school. Or somehow they want to be an actor or actress,stay after for more practices in the Drama club.\n\nWouldn't you want to see your kids graduating college with a master degree? Yes, every parent wishes that for their kids. In that matter students could join extracurricular activities,do community hours, prepare for what they want to be, and be successful.",

      "All students should have a decision if they want to play a extracurricular sport. One reason is that some students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and doing homework stuff like that. Next, reason is students might not like the sports that are given to play, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not given that much attention to school, because they are so into the sport they are playing. So, i think students should have a choice to play a extracurricular sport.\n\nOne reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, that they don't have enough time to play a extracurricular activity. Students might have a job to do after school, like working, have to babysit there sister, and get somebody off the bus everyday, etc. Students don't have enough time to do an sport, and have responsibilities to do too. Therefore, Students have responsibilities to do that doesn't require doing an activity that can take time away from doing that.\n\nNext reason is students might not like the activity given to play. Someone might not appreciate or like the activity they have to play, because they don't know how to play or just to lazy to play it with others. Students nowadays like to choice what they want to play not what others want them to play; because they might not like the activity given to them. For example they might have got picked to play soccer, they never played soccer so they may not like to play; because they never played that exact activity. Therefore, they should play what they played or seen get played by them or others.\n\nLastly, students are not paying enough attention in school. They are so focused on that one activity that they forget about what is happening around them. Students give so much attention into something not that much important as school and there grades. There grades are dropping because they skip half of class just to do an activity, they never make it up because so into what happened during that activity time. Therefore, school should come first before any sport and everything else avoiding that school time.\n\nIn conclusion, students should have a decision to what they want to do for there after school activity. One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and getting younger kids off the bus, etc. Another reason is students might not like that activity given to them, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school, because they are so into that activity. To sum this up no i don't think every student should have to play an activity if they don't like or don't have enough time, or not paying attention in class.",

      'Imagine every single student at your school is associated/participating in a sport, helping the yearbook committee, or even just serving on the student council because it could greatly impact the school by making it more organized and "healthier". Well thats exactly what my principle has decided to do. But not only can this change how there doing in school, it can also affect how they are struggling financially with all the fees they have to pay.\n\nTime plays an important role in this because a lot of students wont be able to fit an extra material into there daily schedules because there already jam packed with other things they need to do throughout the day. This is also a little cruel for students because they would have to be occupied with numerous things at once and still remember to do other things. If the principles say that we must do an extracurricular activity, we wont have any time to do our own things. Students dont like to be stressed out and having to do lots of things at once. We already get tons of homework that some of us dont even finish because of the time we have isnt enough. So students might even stop turning in homework on time or even at all. Because focusing on other things has made it harder for them to keep up with school work. And then the student is blamed on for not doing it, but its not really there fault that they dont have enough time at home to finish everything. Students are getting the time taken away that they could use to do something that they enjoy like; spending time with there pets, relaxing, hanging out with friends etc. And that could affect how there school performance is going. Also they time they should be using as homework there turning in there free time because they dont have any other time for themselves.\n\nMoney is also a problem in this situation because not everyone is going to have the necessary money needed to pay off the fees, or to get the materials needed for the activity they have chosen to do. But if the school offers to help pay the fees, then it would be a lot easier for those who need help financially. Im not saying they should pay the full price, but that they could help pay some of it, and the family getting helped does too;so that way they are both contributing. If money support isnt an option for them, then they just wont be able to participate and that should be blamed on the school not the family because its not their fault there struggling and cant afford to pay there children activities that the school says they "must" do. But whats the school going to do if they dont? suspend them? I think not.\n\nMost students wouldnt even want to participate in an extra curricular activity because they are already stressed out at home and have other things to deal with. Maybe the student is going through a rough time and doesnt want to be pressured into doing something extra thats just going to worsen there problem. So they shouldnt be forced to do something they dont want.\n\nOverall the schools shouldnt be doing this because its just a waste of time, money, and academic time. students already have a handful of things they need to keep up with for example: homework, they usually get it everyday with every class; that is already stressful enough. Religious activities like attending church or going to mutual, babysitting for friends or family, or even just spending time with friends,family and even pets. But with the school making us do other extracurricular activities, we wont have time do to what we enjoy and make us happy. ',

      "I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.\n\nParticipating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.\n\nAn extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.\n\nI positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular. They don't even have to take up that much time. There are an amazing amount of opportunities and benefits that come from them that shouldn't be passed. It could just be something to do after school, or it could be what you love to do. An extracurricular is great for everybody.",

Some of them can be boring making people not want to do them. Then theres some people that love doing activitys like that. It shouldn't be up to the principal if they want to participate in them or not.\n\nThere is just some people that can't participate in things like sports , if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then. But for now they're just for fun and now days teenagers just want to hangout with friends and be on their phone. There is some people that barely get to spend time with their family because they're so busy so they don't have time for activitys.\n\nWith sports being a extracurricular activity there is some people that can't afford is because it can be exspincve and some kids/families don't have the money for that. Theres some kids that would love to do things like sports , but don't have transpartion or money and some schools don't always have rides for students to get back and forth.\n\nSome students can't participate in things like that because they get in to much trouble *they only do it like that at some schools*\n\nI don't really see a point of having to do a extracrricular activity theres just no point. I don't think trying it once would hurt to see if you like it or not! If our principal made us do this i feel like it should be once a mouth because other people have other things to do and are busy , and i feel like the students should be able to pick what activity they want to do or not. And the teachers should put it in as a grade if they participate or not.\n\nEnd of teh story , i think theres no point in extracurricular activitys.",

      "I was in the hallways looking for an after school activity I couldn't find one that I liked or seemed interesting. The principal made it so that everyone has to do an extracurricular activity after school. I disagree with this decision.\n\nI disagree with this decicion because some people just don't get along with others and those activities require them to talk to people they may not like. Some people are shy and get nervous talking to people. Others are rude and don't like people in general, and people don't want to talk to them. Some people just can't make friends because they're funny looking. People like those anime kids probably can't make friends either because they stay hissing at people and having crushes on cartoon charaters. People can be depressed and not want to do anything after school just go home and lay in their bed the rest of the day.\n\nIf someone has do to a sport because there is no other activities to do them they won't enjoy what they're doing. Even if they end up liking it they are doing it for fun not because they want to win everygame. Also is it's a sport you are making thwem spent their money on something you forced them to do. They could have used that money for something that they actually need like food or for paying their bills but no you want them to pay for a jersey, shoes, special socks and they didn't even want to do the sport in the first place. Their family could be really struggling to pay the rent and you want them to give you $100 for a jersey.\n\nSome people might not even enjoy being out doors or they might not be in the mood to be doing stuff like that they just want to go home to their dog or to their nice and comfertable bed but no you want them to spend more energy on after school stuff and teachers already complain about how some kids never do their work and thye dotn care what the excuse is. Someone could say \"Sorry I couldn't do my homework my grandpa died yesterday\" and the teacher would say \"that's tough you should have done before he died you had time then didn't you\" and with everyone doing after school activities there is no time for homework because you get home around six or seven then you eat because you must be starving then you take a shower and boom it's time to sleep and you got no homework done.\n\nI disagree with the decision to make everyone have an after school activity becuase not everyone has time or the personality to be hanging out with random people everyday after school. Some people might be depressed and others can't make friends. Not everyone has the money for supplies they need for their activity.

      "Did you ever have an extracurricular activity or also known as an after school activity in school? Some students after school participate in clubs or sports like the year book, student council, or football. Now some schools they may require you to participate in an after school activity, and others may not. Personally i am against it because many students work after school, many students have no interest in any, and many students who dont want to be there will be a distraction to those who do want to be there.\n\nFirst there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. If they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. They may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. If you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.\n\nSecondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. Maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. Now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. If they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.\n\nLastly it could cause stress. School puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. Have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. Some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. Some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.\n\nIn conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. Now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. Its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.",

    ESSAY:
      "How would you feel if everyday after eight hours of sitting at a table, righting down notes, listening to someone talk to you about something you may or may not like, getting up for five minutes just for it to happen again, and then when the bell rings instead of going home you go into another classroom to do an activity you dont like and didnt choose? Because that is what it would be like for students if they had mandatory extracurricular activities. Every student having to go to a after school has been a very debated issue for a long time. Mandatory extracurricular activities have their benefits, but their cons out weigh them. The principal of Generic_School middle school has decided that this is false, and that every person going to a after school is a great idea. I disagree with this, and here's why. Students should not have to attend extracurricular programs because of their freedom of choice, not all after schools are equal, and because of the funds needed for them.\n\nFirst Students should have the ability to choose which after school program they would like to go to. One reason they should be able to do this is they can spend more time with their family which is very important in this stage of their life. Another is that they could choose to do homework instead which I think is something many of them would rather do. Finishing homework gives a senses of relief that it is over and you have nothing to be concerned about. My last reason to support this is letting students make their own decisions makes them more independent as well as learn life lessons you cant get in school. For example they could decided that \"I want to put in one and a half hours into my homework, thirty minutes to study, one hour to have dinner, and four hours of free time.\"\n\nSecondly not all of the extracurricular activities the school provides are equal. This is shown in how much time some activities require. Specifically a student may have to go to basketball practice very day while a person in the art club only goes once a week. The next way they are unequal is in how much effort is put into the after school. An example of this is a teen in the book club would need to put in far less effort than someone on the debate team.\n\nThe third way extracurricular programs are not equal is in how much is costs to run them. For instance In the art club they use lots of very expensive materials like paints, canvases, and clay. This would cost much more that the soccer team that only needs to replace soccer balls and goals. This leads me to my next reason why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools\n\nThe last reason as to why we should not have mandatory extracurricular programs is the amount of money needed to support all of the activities. Having enough after schools so that all of the kids will be able to go to them will put a lot of strain on the schools finances. This will result in the school not being able to adequately educate their students during the actual school day. If the burden of whos to pay for the extracurricular activities does not fall on the school it will fall on others in one of two ways. The first way is they will charged the parents of the kids directly. Many family's cant pay the cost of the after schools even if they wanted to making the the school still suffer a loss. The second way is to raise taxes which will give parents a lesser financial burden than charging them directly, but will make taxes high for others who don't have kids and will surely not go down well.\n\nIn conclusion being able to choose which extracurricular activity you desire, the after school programs being unequal, and the cost to run them are all very good reasons why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools. If you agree with this than wright a letter to your or our school board telling them your own reasons as to why schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities. By righting this I hope to prevent the horrible experience that I described to you and let you go home after exactly eight hours.",

      "Do you like different activities? This one time I didn't want to participate in an activity. Even though you don't want to participate in the activity, it will still help you. Then other people will remember you in life. I agree with the principal's approach because it can help you later in life, it can get you more involved with great things, and it can possibly make you famous.\n\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity can help you later in life. It can help you because people would be there for you. More and more people will know you and help you out with the rest of your life. Basically what I'm saying is the more people know you the more it will help. Now that's how people know how bad you want help later in your life.\n\nAnother effect of participating in an extracurricular activity is it will get you more involved with different activities. Just like the second paragraph this is one is great too. When you get more involved its good for you because you meet different people and famous people. Thats how it can help you later in life. When you participate in an extracurricular activity, its almost like the start of a new adventure.\n\nOne more thing of participating in an extracurricular activity is that it can possibly make you famous. Now this is the best part of this adventure. How you can be famous from one thing just like that you ask? Well there are people watching you. You could be an National Football League star, a professional Newsreporter, or maybe the next President of the United States.\n\nNow I think people should agree with the principal's new approach because you could be the changer of this world. Even though you think you don't want to, you can still try it and you just might like it. The best part of being famous you are the boss, and you could change the country forever possibly. All you have to do is try an extracurricular activity. Come on try it people try it. You will miss out if you don't get more involved. It's not too late to agree with the principal's approach. ",

      "Once my sister noticed she didn't get into the collage she wanted, she fell on the ground and cried her eyes out. She wished she had gone back to do more activities when she was younger, but there was no turning back now. Participating in activities are very important for every ones future. If someone doesn't participate in something, they wont only get a possibly scholarship, but also might not get the dream job they have wanted. Principals should make people participate in activities such as a club, sport, or student council\n\nIt is good to have social interaction with peers. If someone stays in the house all the time, not going out anywhere, then they might not have a good chance at getting into a collage they wanted. Participating in extracurricular activities might give someone extra points for collage, or make them look good for a collage. On the other hand, if people don't do extracurricular activities they might not be accepted in many collages. It is very important to do exracurricual activities while someone still can!\n\nCertain jobs may check someones background to see what they have done for a living, but if they haven't done anything except for playing video games all day, they might not get the job. Jobs are very important for someones upcoming future. If someone has done a lot of activities in high school, or donated to charity often, they will have a bigger chance of getting a job than someone who hasn't participated in anything.\n\nLaying around all day could cause health issues. If someone just lays around all day they might become very unhealthy and not get the exercise they need, but if you are active and doing activities, that will change the situation for you completely. Moving around is good for ones health. If someone is laying on the couch, scrolling through Instagram all day and never getting up could get them Diverticulitis. Being unhealthy like that could cause serious problems, definitely at such young age.\n\nNot doing school activities will, possibly, affect someones life for the rest of their life. They might not get their dream job, get a good scholarship, or be healthy. Extracurricular activities can change someones life for the better, it is best to do it now than regret it later on in someones life time.",

      "What if your principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity? How would you respond to that? Would you go against them or stand with them? My principal made that decision for our school and I am standing with him! Extracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school.\n\nExtracurricular activities are an extreme benefit and help to the community. Many clubs actually are made to serve and make changes to the community. However, many people believe that students shouldn't be the ones having to do extra work to help out. It isn't all about the changes or the service it also helps them come together as a community and accomplish things as a team. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community.\n\nBenefiting the students is another thing extracurricular activities do. Students learn many skills such as teamwork, leadership, and responsibility when they take part in these activities. Extracurricular activities teach students many things that they wouldn't learn during school hours or class time. When the students take part in these amazing things, the build an even more amazing reputation for themselves. Many say that students will lose focus and interest in school when they take a part in extracurricular activities. But, in reality extracurricular activities are the reason some students come to school and strive to do their best.\n\nSchools benefit a lot from extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities keep schools motivated and running smoothly. Many extracurricular activities require competition this means they keep healthy competition going. Clubs and teams bring the school closer. Students feel as isn't just a place to do pencil paper work when they can actually do these things and them be associated with school. These activities surely are expensive on school. But, the experiences that they bring students are worth more than a million dollars.\n\nExtracurricular activities benefit the community, the students, and the school. Extracurricular activities help build a strong, healthy, and happy community. Extracurricular activities are the reason students are great leaders and strive to do their best. These activities help a school build their backbone and the way others see them as a whole. Wouldn't it be amazing if your principal made you take part in these activities!",

      "Do you like doing extracurricular activates at school like sports, yearbook, and student council if not then this is a good place for you. I think this because the kids most of the time get to pick there activity, they can have fun in these activities and make new friends, and they can help you make friends you didn't know. There are a lot of activities you can do and just pick the best one in your opinion and have fun. I think that kids should do this because when school is out and after most kids just sit around and not work but with after school activities kids will use there brain more then if they are just sitting around.\n\nIn school most kids are not interested in school because they think it is boring but most after school programs will,l make it fun thats why kids go there . But in extracurricular activities you can choose what you want to do and you can have a good time. If you like sports then you could play a lot of sports. If you like board games then you can play board games. But if your not good in school then there might be consequences like not choosing your favorite activity. E\n\nxtracuticular activities will help and thats one of the reasons I like them.\n\nIn after school activities you can make friends that have the same interest as you. If you choose it and someone else dose as well then you probably like the same thing. You came make friends that can last you a life time. It helps to know that the other person likes what you like so you can do it together and not come plane about it. Extracurricular activities will help make friends that have the same interests as you and thats one of the reasons i like them.\n\nYou can join a club that is fun and you can get some school help from it as well. It can help you pass a class if you need some extra help in it. It can also be really fun like sports then you probably think they are fun and sometimes you can learn something from that sport. You can do their things like Lego club, reading club, and ext. E\n\nxtracuticular activities will help make friends and thats one of the reasons i like them.\n\nI think that having extracurricular clubs is good and i think that all schools should have it . It is good because most of the time kids get to choose their own club, they can make new friends, and they can be fun and they may help you out with school. I think that they will help kids because kids will be lying around in their house doing nothing after school but when they work it can get there brains going.        ",

      "The principal just announced a new school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate in at least on after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.\n\nFirst of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.\n\nIn this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great.\n\nGoing off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere!\n\nIn conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people. ",

    ESSAY:
      "You have so much to do! You have a pile of homework, youth group, errands, and, on top of that, you have to meet with a club that you don't want to be in. If you force someone to do things that they don't want to do, there can be a lot of negative effects. As a result, I don't think that participating in an extracurricular should be required because people who are forced to join something will probably not participate well, could get very stressed and overwhelmed with the extra load, and people who are not already in a club have multiple reasons to not join.\n\nFirst off, if you aren't able to find an extracurricular that you like, you could be forced to join one. Then, if you're forced to join a club that you do not like, that could hinder the group's progress and work. For example, if someone who doesn't know how to play lacrosse joins the lacrosse team, some people would be angry. Especially if the new person doesn't want to play and doesn't know how. They are most likely diving headfirst into the sport without learning the rules. That means they wouldn't know how to check correctly, wouldn't know defense or attack, and wouldn't know the rules for scoring. On top of that, them not wanting to do lacrosse would ruin the team dynamic. We had a player one year who did not want to play on the defense, so she played the position as bad as she could, making the people who were trying to play well angry, and ruining our teamwork. So, if people don't want to participate in a club or sport, they might ruin it for everyone else, and that wouldn't be beneficial.\n\nNext, having an extracurricular on top of everything that you already have to do, like homework or family, could make you stressed and exhausted. I know for me that having lacrosse practice, Odyssey of the Mind, and homework every single day makes me exhausted. I enjoy playing lacrosse, and I enjoy OM, but when I get home from lacrosse after an hour and a half, and having done OM before that, I have exceeded my limits of activity for the day. All that I want to do is take a shower and go to sleep. If I have to do my homework and spend more time working, I will most likely be very tired the next day. With that, other people might have little siblings that they have to take care of, and being in a club, going home and doing their homework, and after that, taking care of siblings, will give them a lot of stress to do everything fast, making them rush their homework to make sure that their sibling are cared for, or neglecting their siblings to do their homework well. Juggling multiple responsibilities can impact stress levels, productivity, and time management.\n\nFinally, people who are not in a club can have multiple reasons not to be in a club. You could choose not to be in a club because your parents can't pick you up afterwards, you have too much homework every night, you have siblings to take care of, etcetera. People who aren't participating in any extracurriculars just might not want the responisibility of remembering. Everyone has a reason, even if it's that it doesn't sound interesting.\n\nJoining an extracurricular should not be forced onto students. I think that if you force someone to do anything that they do not want to, they will not participate and that will come back around to you in negative ways.",

      "If my principle were to require every student to participate in an extra curricular activity, I would disagree. I choose to disagree because, some students might not have the time, parents or adults at home cant take or pick them up, money problems, students are needed at home and, they should be able to have the choice to participate in an extracurricular activity or not. I feel it is unfair to force all students to participate in an activity.\n\nMany students might not have the time to do an extracurricular activity. They could have a lot of homework they must do or, they could be busy doing other things. Parents might also not have the time to bring their kids to the activities and pick them up as well. Many parents work and they might even work until late. How would they be able to transport their kids to and from their activities? From my expirience, my parents are both really busy. My dad goes to work from early in the morning and doesn't get home until about 7PM. He's busy all day. Therefore, he wouldn't be able to to get my siblings or I from our activities. My mom also helps my dad at work, they're both really busy. She has to take my brother and I to our practices everyday then, pick us up. I myself am a busy person. I have practice 5 times a week and they're back to back. Sometimes I have to wait hours to eat and most nights I don't have enough time to do my homework. I go to sleep late and do it all over again the next day. You can't buy time or make it go by slower to get to and from those activities. It all doesn't fit into some peoples scheduals.\n\nForcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity isn't fair for a lot of reasons. Some students might not be interested in sports. Some might not be interested in being on the school council. Some might not be interested in working on the yearbook. Some just might not be interested in any of the activities that are provided. Everyone has different things they like or enjoy doing. Forcing students to do something they don't like, makes them feel uncomfortable or out of place, it isn't fair. It makes them miserable. Schools focus on including everyone but sometimes they don't include how a student feels.\n\nMoney is also an issue. I know for a fact that participating in a sport isn't free. Nothing in this world is ever really free. We never know about a familys money situation but, it's important to keep in mind that some people struggle and that includes even providing food for their family. On top of that housing bills, other bills, insurance, taxes and savings is already a hassle for a family who is struggling. Adding activities that require a payment for an activity that a kid is forced to do is even more unfair and more trouble. It adds too much stress.\n\nIn conclusion, forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity could be an inconvienance as well as unfair. Not a lot of good things come out of a situation like this. The negatives cancel out the positive.        ",

      "Everyone needs a break from something they tend to stress about so they can get there stuff together. Meaning, if you keep pushing yourself to do something your having a hard time on you should take a break and do something you that will calm you down to help you. My principal says that students should attend any type of extracurricular avtivities. Such as art, sports, yearbook, and many more. I agree with my principal with his thought of choice.\n\nHaving fun classes can really help student when they start having a ruff time in school. Class is really stressful for me and others when they don't understand something at school. My happiness is soccer, art, and writing. Those 3 things help me so much. So when i'm strugling the only thing I think about is doing something I know that will keep my mind off of it and will start to calm me down. Art is one of the best class anyone can take. I say this because art, is litearlly art. You can do art out of anger, stress, sadness, and even happiness. Litearally out of anything. If your planning on doing a new sport in high school it can build your stress to even it to be better. I would have to wait all the way until i get home to play soccer, but in high school you will have a period so you can do that sport or activity. You should'nt be forced to keep doing your work without a break from being overwhelmed.\n\nThe more you practice the better you get. I understand when people say the more you study in school the more you understand. Thats not just for school work. It's also for these fun activities. Say you have never done a sport before, but want to start. You can do that in school and then when you sign up for the sport you want to do you will already be really really good, because all the practice you have got. Also, most people in middle school want to do a sport in high school. If you participate in that specific sport the coaches will see that you are really intrested in doing it. You can even do soemthing you never thought you would do, like Yearbok. Yearbok is a fun activityt and you can do a lot. The more you do it the best you get. That can be you new enjoyable hobby. No one ever knows what you can't do.\n\nAlthough, students being allowed to do a fun class during learning hours can get them to lose the thought of there work. Students should focus on school work and schol work only. Especially for those who want a good career in the future. You can actually make a lot of money from art. Art is a easy activity you can do for your whole life, and it will also lead you to big things. The most important thing in my opinion is to do something that will get you somewhere ahead of life. Doing that will help you sucseed within your future. Anyting you enjoy doing as an activity can get you somehwere.\n\nExtracurricular activities should be a new thing students at Hayfield should attend, and many more schools. I think that is a really good idea to allow for us students. No one should be stressed about someting that they need in life, what do you think?",

    ESSAY:
      '"Ughhhh," said Generic_Name, "I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. "Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?" Generic_Name questioned, "well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school," Generic_Name\'s Mom replied. "I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, dont you think so Mom?" Generic_Name said, "I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there," Generic_Name said, "sure honey, I think thats the best idea ever!" Generic_Name\'s Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.\n\nFirst, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at least one school activity tend to be more self confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self-confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self-confident.\n\nSecond, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becoming a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.\n\nThird, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high-school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.\n\nImagine, you have just made your high-school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. Your a great, wise person that everyone looks up to and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouth-watering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.',

      "Dear Principal,\n\nI strongly disagree with you all students should not have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Such as, participateing in sports,work on a yearbook, or serve as a student council.\n\nWho would want to do a extracurricular activity when we already have seven hours of school that's over working us. If we have that added on to school a lot of students will be going to sleep in school. Studies show that in the U.S. 45% of students is going to sleep in school. So, why would you add an extra activity\n\nSo it can waste more of our energy? So we can go to sleep faster?\n\nI strongly advise everyone not to do any type of sports. You will get sore from pratice,injured,break a bone, tear your A.C.L. or worser. Lke in football you can get seriously injured. Why yall want us to do a type of sport we can ge injured in? Studies show that 58% of students get injured by Participating in sports.\n\nWe should just and learn then to do the extracurricular activity. School is for learning right?\n\nWorking on a yearbook is just wasting our learning time while we could be learning about math,reading, or science. We can finsh the yearbook in one day so what's the point of makeing it an activity that's just takeing takeing time from our learning. Matter of fact you can just just select five or six people to do yhe yearbook it's no point of makeing it an activity. By the way way why start this early you should wait until June.\n\nServe as a student council? That's not even an activity that's just for one person so, why should that even be included as an activity? That's not a reason why everybody in the whole school do an extra activity in the school. That's just for that one person. That's not an reason why we should miss out of learning because of an student council. That one person should do that while we learning our education that will be great.\n\nIn conclusion, we should not have to an activity beacuase we come to school for to learn not to no extracurricular activity while we could be studying for the S.O.L. or matbe learning something new. We shouldn't waste time from our learning to do an extracurricular activity while we can be getting our education in an class. If we was to do that activity students will be fallling sleep in class, chance of being injured, chance of getting bone broken, tearing your A.C.L. and etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ",

      'A famous basketball player once said "I never wanted to do sports. Until i tried something new." I agree all students should have to participate in a type of school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about.\n\nFirst of all,students that would be considered shy might need a push to make friends. Maybe putting them in a uncomfortable situation would open their minds into something they would not have expected. Maybe your a \'new kid\' in town and really dont have friends but, you really like Volleyball or Basketball and the school requires you to play you now have people who likes the same things as you.\n\nfurthermore, it gives them something to write on collage applications .collage people love reading about you when you played volleyball or seeing that you were sons school council. you could use that as your collage easy. and if you do a sport is would act as a scholarship if you play you cold go to collage and not have to pay money and things of that nature.\n\nAnother key factor, it gives you something to talk about. maybe your not a great conversation starter and you need help. and is great conversation to have with people how dont know what b they want to do and you have something to talk with your teammates about like "that was a great game "\n\nAnother reason it it gives you a great experiences meaning learn and in general they get a good out looking on different things. For example the learn That they do not like basketball and soccer you still have these skills that you learned while your figuring out you dont like that activity..another example if you some a a famous writer your books can be based off of many different things you activities you did as a child.\n\nIn conclusion as a student i believe that you should participate in a school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about. if you dont play sports now in the future you will regret it .                       ',

    ESSAY:
      "Should the principal be allowed to force decisions on their students? While this may lead to some poor decisions, it would be better in the long run. \"Why?\" you say, you see 70% of kids don't do social or physical activities of any kind, and suffer as a result. There are also a lot of times where kid's are forced to do something new and then end up liking it. Something they never would have done they liked. Along with that, putting kid's through these programs could also give them valuable life skills. Overall, I do think that the principal, or whoever is managing the school, should be allowed to force these programs upon kids.\n\nMy first point I'm going to list is that it get's them doing something. Like I said a lot of kids don't do anything by themselves, and around 2/3 of them have less than three friends. There is a whole outside world waiting for them. It is also noted that these kids more often than not have great talents, which are just waiting to shine. With a stronger school, getting them to go outside, and participate in activities such as clubs, school teams, and the student council would be easy and beneficial, and some of these benefits would be stronger and smarter kids, and more school funding for these programs.\n\nThe second reason I think this should be done, is because of practical reasons. The goal of the school is to cram as much as they can into the student before the year's end. They could also set up after school activities straight after school to do this even better, along with this would help students who don't have parents or guardians at home. Whether this would be mandatory or not is one sided, it must be mandatory. Another practical reasons this should be done is that it would allow more time for the teacher and student to interact helping with the normal school day and settling any problems.\n\nOne thing other people might say is that it would increase costs, and that the school shouldn't be messing with the student's childhood. Both of those accusations are wrong. Doing these has been shown in several studies to not be very expensive, and is literally just a step up from end of day clubs. The second point isn't true either, the school is a part of the student's childhood, and they should be embracing it. Younger generations haven't learned what and what not to do yet, and the school can help them decide.\n\nIn the end, I do think that the principal should be able to force activities like these upon the students, to improve their live skills, and maybe provide a bit of fun. Of course, the United States is a republic, so it all depends on the parent's, but I do think they will agree with what I say, that children shouldn't be sitting in their bed all lazy, but be making important life choices.\n\nNow what do I think you think of this? Even if you are just a student, and not a parent of teacher who already knows all the benefits, it is for your personal future, and it will be better for you. Tell other people about this idea, and eventually it will be national education.",

      '"\n\nYour principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree or disagree with this decision?"\n\nExtracurricular activities are some ways that students use their free time after school. On average, about 65% of all in students in Virginia participate in a extracurricular activity such as a sport, club etc.. I think that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity because it will help students with their college applications, students can find new interests, and students can meet new people.\n\nFirstly, it will help students have a better, stronger, college application. Extracurricular activities are a strong factor on college applications. According to one of the admission officers at Harvard University,\n\n"students are 10x more likely to get into an ivy league or higher ranked university, if he/she has more extracurriculars on their application."\n\nMany colleges like to see extracurriculars on an application, rather than not.\n\nSecond, students are gonna be able to find new interests. Students are more likely gonna find their passion for something if they do an extracurricular. Helping students find their passion in something can help them take classes with their interests and help them improve in that skill set required for their passion. In my experience, having extracurriculars helped me find interest for many of the things I love today.\n\nLastly, extracurricular activities can help students meet new people. Meeting new people is probably the best part of doing extracurricular activities. Extracurriculars are good for students to meet others that share the same interests as them. For example students who tend to be more quieter and to themselves can have an easier time opening up to new people they\'ve met if they like the same thing, and this can lead to them creating lifelong friendships with them.\n\nConclusively, helping students with their college applications, students finding their passion, and helping students meet new people are reasons why principals should require an extracurricular activity amongst all students. These extracurriculars can benefit a students school, and social life in a positive way. Requiring students to do an extracurricular of their interest can lead them to enjoying arriving and being at school more than before. Extracurriculars can also highly affect a students future in many positive ways.',

She finally arrives with a hungry smile and cruel eyes and says,"Generic_Name did you do your homework?"."No i did not teacher because I had no time due to the outrageous rule that the principal made that made it mandatory that all students participate in one extracurricular activity." Her eyes gleamed with anticipation as she gave Generic_Name an F and walked off to seek her next victim. The rule that dictates that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity is a mutiny and should be abolished at once because,students can use the extra time for more beneficial uses such as doing their homework or catching up on some sleep,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.\n\nThe first reason why the rule that states that you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be nullified is,that students can use the extra time for more productive purposes such as doing homework or catching up on some sleep. When i was younger I used to participate in writing club and when I would come back home I would be drained. I would have no energy to do anything so the majority of the time my assignments went incomplete and turned into zeros. One day the teachers started noticing the lack of turned in assignments and called my parents for a parent teacher conference. the teachers brought me and my parents to a table wearing serious expressions. The teacher said,"Your son has displayed superior thinking skills but the lack of turned in assignments astounds us." My parents replied by saying,"Our son gets back everyday from writing club extremely tired and does not have the time or energy to do his homework." they came to a conclusion to cancel writing club for me and then I started turning in my homework on time. 44 percent of homework is not completed due to lack of time. If you say that they can do their homework when they get home after the extracurricular activity I would say that kids are not fully developed adults yet and dont have as much energy or stamina and cannot function after long periods of time.\n\nThe second reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be abolished is,that schools do not specialize in what club or sport that they offer and they will not teach it as well as the facilities that specialize in what they are offering. Its not the schools job to provide extra clubs they can offer clubs but they should not be able to force you to join a club. If a child wants to play a sport or endorse an activity, he can go to an outdoor club or facility that specializes in what the child wants to do. When i was eleven years old,I played on my school soccer team. The coach did not know how to play soccer and I hated it. I never got any better and I almost quit soccer then and there,but I went home one night and told my mom about it. She said,"You should try UCLA Soccer I read about it it\'s very interesting". I tried it out the very following week it was amazing,I loved it and,I have been playing soccer ever since. If you say that the school clubs can also be good at teaching what they do I would tell you that a school club will never be as good at teaching a sport or activity than an actual facility that specializes at the given sport or activity.\n\nThe third and final reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activities must be abolished is,that if you force the kids to choose from a limited set of sports and clubs they might not like any of the activities that you are offering and because of that they will never practice what they are being taught and will never get better at what they are being taught. If a person does not like what they are being taught 98 percent of the people will not practice the subject or sport they do not like. If you dont practice what you are being taught you will never get better at what you are practicing and will never succeed at it. My cousin used to play karate and he hated it he would always pass the tests but he would never practice and as a black belt some of the blue belts that practiced were stronger than him. One day his mom asked him"Why arent you as good as some of the other students"? He replied by saying,"I dont enjoy karate like I used to and as a result,I don\'t practice anymore".\n\nIf you say that people at school can like the subject or sport they are being taught I would say that is the reason extracurricular activities should be offered but not forced.\n\nGeneric_Name smiles at the teacher as she comes by "Do you have your homework she asks"?"Yes ma am."he replies with a grin. Ever since the rule that made extracurricular activities mandatory got abolished he has had time to finish all of his assignments and still had a little time for relaxation. I disagree with the principal\'s rule that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity because students can use the time for more beneficial purposes,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will not benefit them.',

      "Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so why not satiate all three by participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wide joy by solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!\n\nFirstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved by participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached by all participants makes the friend-finding process much more simple. Exracurriculars also provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel they don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel they do. Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability by building support systems has never been more important.\n\nNext, parents may find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school may not have to do that anymore, at least for a day or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new found friends to get home.\n\nFinally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!\n\nIn SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.\n\nExtracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires joy in people is always a good option. Starting with extracurricular activities is a great option!",

In my opinion, participating in one extracurricular activity is termenously and entertainment for students.\n\nFrist, participating in one extracurriclar activity can help students on their others subjects or doing their other school work. For example, if students particpates in more than one activity they can not focus on their other subject like math, doing thier homeworks and studing for thier tests. In addtion for students to focus or particpate on thier other subject is better for them to participate in one activity.\n\nNext, particpateing in one activity have a great impact on students.

All activity are not easy some are diffcult and some of them are easy but we have to try our best.\n\nFurthermore, students should particpate in one extracurriclar activity because they can complete their work on time.

      "Participating in an after school activity is important, but should not be required. Not everybody would want to be forced to do a extracurricular activity because a lot of the people who don't, exercise on their own. Even though activities are healthy physically and mental, they should not be forced upon students or anybody, it should be their choice of how their future will be, no one should choose for them. Even doing something to help out the school would be a bad idea because that would extend a lot of the students school hours. Some students like to do homework at their home, not at school. Others have pets that they need to take care of and if their parents sent them to the vet for the day, that would cost a lot of money for them. Others could have had a horrible day and would want to go home immediately, but they would be forced too stay and that would make them feel much worse. Because students are stressed through out most of the day, staying after school for at least an hour a day would be bad for their brains. Yes I agree that after school activities is a good idea, but forcing it would take the fun out of it. Students should be able to choose what they do in their lives, not having it already chosen. Causing more stress for a student could be bad for their future, stress leads to headaches which leads to migraines, which is bad for the brain. An unhealthy brain would affect the students overall grade in school. If a student is stressed out, it will be harder for them to sleep the following night due to their brains being worn out. Students in middle school already get very little sleep from the early school hours, they will get less sleep from stress from school. If their bodies to not already produce a certain amount of meletonin, (The substance the brain produces to cause sleep) it will be much harder for them to sleep. Sleep for students and adults is very important because it effects their everyday lives. More students staying after school will also cause the teachers to have more stress from the students complaining that they are being help hostage or something in a joking way. The teachers would get annoyed from that very quickly, which would cause stress in the future for them too.\n\nFor example, if a student was the head of the student council, that means that he could have to do extra work at home instead of getting free time which helps calm the brain down. If he/she had ADHD such as myself, they might not know how to handle it as well as others with the same condition, it could make them very upset and they would not do the work, but they would be stressed because they would need to turn it in. If a kid did sports and got injured while playing or in their free time, it would affect their ability to play the sport and affect their performance in Physical Education of which would affect their grade. Somebody who does not play a sport but exercises in their free time would be forced to play a sport or stay after school and do an activity would most likely be unhappy due to the loss of their free time. I am not saying that students should not play a sport or stay after school, because they should be able to exercise in their own time and stay after school for an activity that they have chosen. Exercise is important for everybody, but it should not be forced, they will be the ones to live with their own consequences. If that where to happen. Students would fall asleep in class from being to tired to stay awake. Students would need multiple breaks through out the school day to keep them engaged knowing that they will have to stay after school. Others will be exited because that means that they will get to play sports more often because they find sports enjoyable, as others do not. If the students who play sports are passionate about sports and they lose their game, they would become upset which would cause stress because they would practice more often thinking that they will never win which could cause a breakdown from not achieving their goal under a lot of unneeded stress. If they win a game, then play against the same team again, they would think that they would easily win again, but lose due to being cocky. which would lead the the breakdown, then the other team would be cocky and so on and so forth. If at school the losing team could get mad at each other for not doing as well and could cause a fight between them, the fight would then affect their next game because they would be trying to out do each other.\n\nStudents who get in fights usually make up to each other, but not always. If they where best friends, there is a possibility that it would end up like a hockey fight without the sticks. Fights would probably suspend both of them, that would definitely effect their overall grade. The loss of a close friend or any friend at all would make them upset, which would then cause them to lose sleep the next few nights. When they are grown up, assuming they still have the record of the fight, it would be harder for both of them to get a job due to possible fights.\n\nMost ideas on paper sound perfect if you don't think about it that much or don't think about it at all. But if you really go into detail and think of all of the possible outcomes, it becomes so much easier to find all of the flaws and becomes easier to fix them. To make a big change for students lives, you have to take the time and not rush to get it done, you have to think about preexisting conditions of some students. Consulting with the parents would also be helpful so you can see their point of view, take a vote and ease the students into a new change, not in the time span of a week or month, students would have to adapt to the change live an organism evolving to match its needs as the world changes. Because if the environment changes too quickly, the organism will die, and the death for us all is stress. Every possible outcome has to be considered for a big change, nothing should be instant.",

      "Middle school is supposed to have more freedom to pick and choose for classes,and clubs. If the principal says we must pick an extracurricular activity, it would take away the sense of freedom to choose. So i'm going to voice my opinion that it's our choice,also it makes the principal look bad,and that it takes away our own time.\n\nWe came to this school because its gives us more freedom to choose than elementary school. Now the choice seem more like a duty and make this experience less interesting. If I had to pick a extracurricular activity it feel like a normal class not a fun hobby or an interest. Then when i get a job using the skill from an extracurricular activity I most likely hate my job.\n\nIt also not so good towards the principal. It would make me feel forced and oppressed to do this activity. I'd feel obliged or it feel like a chore more than fun and intriguing. The principal look like a tyrannical ruler to the students.\n\nAlso it called\n\nEXTRA\n\ncurricular activities. Infecense on extra which means not reqiured or more time. It should be our own time to use however we want and not to be consumed by these\n\nEXTRA\n\ncurricular activitys. If I have practive of the same day as the\n\nEXTRA\n\ncurricular activity and it cuts into my practice time do stay so my grade not effected or do I go and work on my dream/goals\n\nSo im hoping after this you will let us choose and make our own decisions.\n\nthank you for reading :)",

      "Our principle has decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity. Students can serve as student council, work on the yearbook, or even play a sport. I think this is a good idea or way for kids to express themselves. Here are some reasons why I agree with being apart of the activities.\n\nOne thing you can do is work on the yearbook. You can also open up and help motivate others. Participating in something helps with many skills such as, communication and working with others. The yearbook could even have anonymous writers, if you want to say something and don't want everyone knowing who said it. Also taking photos of other activities around the school would even be great.\n\nAnother extracurricular activity you could do is serving as student council. If you want to see changes in somethings you can step up and work as a council to make a difference. You could also get groups to hang up motivational quotes around the school. Sometimes, even having funds to raise money for the school would be a helpful idea.\n\nYou can also play sports to participate in an activity. Playing sports gives you the time for you make new friends, do what you love, and even hang with your bestie. Finding a sport you like can be hard but giving it your all is the best you can do. You can even get scholarships to colleges. And being on a team is your best suport group, they are always there when you need them.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree we should be in extracurricular activities. It gives us the opportunity to express our self and have fun doing it. They can also help try and change things to make a difference. The activities also have benefits for us and for school. All of these are reasons why we should participate in extracurricular activities.       ",

      "Being a teenager can be one of the best times of your life. As a teenager, I myself have participated in many sports activities and extracurricular activities in my free time. Although I am lucky enough to have experienced being in a club and on a sports team, other students may not have that opportunity.\n\nI believe that schools should require extracurricular activities, one of the reasons being kids social skills. Being put into different clubs or sports teams can help teens make new friends and provide a larger circle of students they can interact with on a daily basis. Being in those activities can provide new experiences those kids never thought to try. This can spark new interests and lead to students doing bigger and better things in their lives, and also help them with choosing a career path.\n\nThis generation of teenagers has become addicted to technology and social media. Kids ranging from high school all the way down to preschool use technology on a daily basis. If schools require students to participate in an extracurricular activity, It will pull students away from social media and lead to a more productive way in them spending their time. Too much screen time can take a toll on young people's mental health and I believe that in having required activities, kids of all ages can focus on sports rather than their social media status.\n\nIf school were to make extracurricular activities required, they would probably have to provide them for free. Schools can't force the parents to pay for extra activities, nor can some parents afford to pay for those activities. If the school covered the cost of everything the school would get more respect, because it would be showing they didn't just care about grades and they care about your mental health as well. If extracurricular were required it would be good for the school to get to fill up their clubs. For example, they could have more students in the yearbook club, which would improve the quality of the work they put into the yearbook.\n\nIn the end I believe that having required extracurricular activities would really make the school environment a happy and healthier place for students, teachers, and parents. ",

      'Students should at least do one type of extracurricular activity because it will help them learn new things about their selfs, entertain them, and make new friends.\n\nDoing an extracurricular activity can help the students learn new things about their self. For an example I have always thought basketball was a boring and pointless sport but when I saw others playing in this sport I ended up giving it a chance and started playing this sport. I eventually started to like this sport but it took some time getting use to, now it\'s the only thing I can think about all day. If the students learn new things about their self they will become more comfortable with themselves and whenever someone asks a question about what they like or whats their favorite sport they dont have to go "Uhm, I am not really sure I dont know what I really like".\n\nAnother reason students should do an acitivity is because they need to be entertained. Most students get really bored and have nothing to do in their extra time and when students have extra time they just sit around and complain how that there is nothing to do but if a student does a extracurricular activity they will engage in much more activites and not be as bored than before.\n\nAnother good reason for students to do an extracurricular activity is so they can make new friends, some students find it hard to make friends and find it hard to social with others; but if the students join a activity they will get use to being with others and be social more with others and the students will be out of their shell and will be their selfs around others.',

      "Our principal has decided that every student must be at least one extracurricular activity. In my opinion ,I strongly disagree with the principals decision and I think students should have the option and freedom to choose whether they want to participate in school activities or not. So today I'm here to explain why this is a bad idea and hope you will agee with me as well.\n\nFirst of all,most students after school are busy, at least I know I am. When I'm done with school and go home I immediately get ready to go to the gym with my mom, I go to the gym at least 2 hours ,after that I go do my homework ,then prepare for my piano lessons at the community center ,and now adding an activity I'm forced to do my schedule gets pretty tight . Thats also a main reason why students dont go to school activities, they simply don't have enough time. But after the principals decision , students have to re-organize their schedules making them have less time to do the things they really want to do.\n\nSecondly , what if students don't like the activity they are forced to do. Yes, I know they are plenty of choices to choose from , but theres a chance students won't like any of them. It will make them feel pressured, stressful, and not joyful about going there. The student may also rebel , leading to them acting bad around the students and making the activity simply unpleasant.\n\nLastly , this school activities makes it feel like an extra hour of school. We already have enough homework and stress coming at us, so why should we get more? I get that the school is trying to make us be productive and help our school in a fun way with our friends , but whats the fun if we are getting forced to do them, also when students are getting forced to do an school activity it makes students feel like they have to do an extra class that doesn't even help our grades , nor does it count as a grade.\n\nIn conclusion, this are some of the reasons I disagree with the principals decisions. I hope this could change your and the principals mind and take in considerate on students opinions as well.\n\nStudents should choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and not be forced to.

      "Seven hours per day for five days a week and some students have activities to do after school, along with that students have mountain high piles of homework nightly. Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.\n\nSeven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule. Other students may be struggling with an aspect of school and they go to tutoring for that reason. Adding an extracurricular could interfere with the help they need to succeed.\n\nStarting from age seven students are asked to do homework. When students are seven and in 1st grade they may not have a large amount of homework; however, when students are in high school the quantity will only grow. While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.\n\nPlenty of studies have shown that this past generation of students have the the largest amount of stress scientist have seen in years. Whether that stress comes from bullying, home life, school work, mental health, or high expectations, stress is unsettling high in students of all ages. Middle school student worry about the transition to high school, and high school students worry about their transition to college. All students worry, even if those worries are irrational, they are still stressed. That is why adding an extracurricular could be too much to ask of students.\n\nOverall, extracurricular activities being mandatory sounds wonderful and has many pros as well, but when people look closer they realize that it would end up as a train wreck. Extracurricular activities should stay optional for those students who have the time and the energy to do their absolute best.",

      "How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all of the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.\n\nIn the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an extremely big interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyways, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.\n\nWith the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many different opportunities that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremely helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievement for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside of the school as well.\n\nIn the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all of the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activities that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activitites may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",

At the age when your going into high school, you need to be focused in school and focused on your grades and choose a good extracurricular activity so you know what your going to be experiencing when you choose a job that you think will be good for you, and will enjoy. But if a student dosen't choose a extracurricular activity then they won't know what they'll do when they grow up and get older. they probably wont have a good job because they didnt choose a extracurricular activity when they should have in high school.

It allows students to stay occupied or active, It gives students the ability to socialize with friends in and out of school, it could introduce a student to an activity that they have no idea they like until they try it, or it might even give them an idea on what they might want to do for a job as an adult. I think that allowing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, can help a student grow as a person.\n\nI think participating in activities after school is a great idea for all students. I believe that extracurricular activities keeps students occupied or active. For example, sports offer students not only a source of exercise, but it also gives them a form of entertainment and a chance to meet new people with your same interests or have fun with the people you already know. After school activities don't only have to be sports though, there's a variety of options, like music, strategy activities, or art. These allow you to either do more of what you love, or maybe find something new. Also, it could allow them to make new friendships with others. By participating in something like this, can give the student an idea on what they might want to do for a living as an adult. As a student you might not know what to do for a living, but extracurricular activities can allow a student to find a hobby and give them a gist of what they might want to study later on. Finally, these after school activities allow students to practice skills that will help them throughout their life, like strategy, athleticism, and socialization.\n\nOverall, I think that having a rule that makes all students participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea because it keeps students active and participating in something, it allows you to socialize with ones you don't know and ones you do, it also gives you more options for a hobby, maybe you could find something that you are interested in to study later in life, it can give you a chance to find something new that you didn't know you liked before, and finally, it practices important skills that will help you throughout your entire life.

Because sometimes our school needs a little pick me up I think in some spots it could use a little makeover and that's okay.

Some schools have put tons of money into sports like buying new equipment etc. So why not continue on of what people in the past have put money into. Joining sports can be a big deal but no matter what just think about how much you are helping out.\n\nAnother thing you could do is help out with yearbooks. Sometimes it can be really stressful for teachers, so why not lend another helping hand and see where it takes you. I mean you never know, they may really like the way you helped out and may ask you to do other things! You never know what the future holds. Not only can you help out with yearbooks, you could also help out by redecorating some things in your school. Just throw your opinion right in there! It could also turn into something you really enjoy and you could continue on with that. Then all you have left to do is say thank you to your principal.\n\nIf you enjoy painting or building and you want to help out, let someone know and your school can definitely help find something you can do to help. One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking.\n\nIn so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be. This is why i love doing extracurricular activities! Show what you can do and do it. I believe in you!",

      "I disagree with the decision that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.\n\nHere are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.\n\nHowever there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricular activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.\n\nI think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.\n\nIn conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine, one day you're at school, and you hear over the loudspeaker that all students in the building must report immediately to the Lecture Hall, for some new \"adjustments\". Although you are a bit surprised by this sudden announcement, you walk towards the Lecture Hall at a leisurely pace (as if you were anticipating something like this to happen). Once you're there, you sit in a chair and wait for all the other students to come rushing in like a stampede of wildebeests. After everything settles down, the principal picks up a mic from a lectern on the stage and starts a speech. In this speech, he talks about how the after school clubs are experiencing a steep decline in the number of students that attend them. He presents the crowd with a solution to this problem, a solution that is greeted with some harsh criticism from the majority of the student body. He says that, in order to keep the after school program alive, all students will be forced to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and that all students who chose to not follow this new rule will be expelled. Bewildered by this, you yell out in protest of this new policy, but to no avail. For the principal has already left the stage, and now you have to be a part of one of those worthless, unnecessary, and boring after school clubs. As you can see, it is detrimental, to both the students and the school as a whole, to force all of the students in a school into participation in an after school activity. Due to a plethora of factors along with the one I just described, I wholeheartedly disagree with my principal on forcing every student in the school to attend an after school club. If you don't believe me already(in regards with this issue at my school), then hopefully the following paragraphs will succeed in persuading you.\n\nFirst of all, making it mandatory for all students in a school to attend at least one club takes away some of their freedom with how they experience their lives. By this, I mean that, by forcing students to go to an after school club, you are limiting their options for what they can do after school is over. This is due to the simple fact that, once the student chooses their club(s), the time that that club occupies can't really be used for anything else and takes up a big chunk of the student's schedule. To give context, allow me to give you an example. Lets say that Generic_Name, a seventh grader, decided to take\n\nQuiz Bowl as his extracurricular activity. Immediately all regular activities from 2:30- 5:30 are canceled. In addition to this, he now has to go to some weekend meetings, resulting in him not have time to hang out with his friends anymore, study for school, do all of his homework, or go to the gym. Instead, he now has to guess answers to random questions about the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and wait till about 6:00 PM to get picked up by his bus, and then dropped off at home at almost 7:00 PM, completely exhausted and burned out. As, you can hopefully see, having to do even just one after school activity can take a lot time out of a students life, and in extension a lot of freedom with their life.\n\nSecond of all, with this new policy, transportation can become an incredibly detrimental issue for students that suddenly have to take at least one extracurricular activity. This is because there will always be some students in a school who can't take the bus and have parents that work too far away to be able to pick them up, making it nearly impossible for those students to get home safely, or on time. In addition to this, transportation can be a huge issue in the fact that, with\n\nALL\n\nstudents having to take an after school activity, on any given day, buses could have to leave behind some students because of a shortage of seats, leaving those who were left behind with no options to get back home. For example, let's say that all the students decide to participate in an extracurricular activity on the same day. With all of those students, it would be near impossible for them all to get a bus ride home. And because of all the parents that have to work during the time that those students would get picked up, the school would be left with a large crowd of students that have no way of getting home on time.\n\nFinally, this policy will probably create a harmful school environment. By this, I mean that it would result in a multitude of considerably hard-to-deal-with problems. Such problems would be: an unmotivated student body, protesting from parents, and an unproductive student body. The lower school morale may stem from anger in students at the principal, and teachers that are exhausted from being overworked due to the fact that most of them will have to host at least one after school club; the parents might complain due to the fact that they won't be able to interact with their children as much, and because they might not like the discontent in their children; and unproductivity would be caused by students burning out from the extra time that they have to spend in school. In addition to all of these problems, students might also try to not participate in extracurricular activities resulting in extreme punishments(i. e expulsion).\n\nTo wrap it all up, there are a lot of reasons as to why my principal's new policy on extracurricular activities isn't very great. It limits a students freedom, it can't really function due to the lack of transportation that is needed for all of the students, and it creates a bad school environment. For these reasons, I think that the principal shouldn't have made this policy.",

      "Dear Principle\n\nEvery student have to participate in a after school activity. i don't agree with this decision. Because everyone does not have the money or the time and grades for that. Also it would be harder on coaches if a lot of people try out for the team because he is cutting a lot of people from the team. Then parents are going to be mad because there son or daughter is going to get a bad grades just because they didn't do a after school activity. i disagree because people dont have time or money or don't have the grades foe the activity.\n\nPeople barely get free lunch how are they going to pay for trips and a hotel rooms if they have to go places for that after school activity. Also how are they going to find time to do homework. kids need free time to so they can live there lives will they still got it. Also there might not be a sport or activity the kids like cause the club or the sport might go till the school year is over and don't want to be stuck doing something you don't like. Also that's disrespect full if you force someone to do a after school activity.\n\nParents might not like having to pick there kid up everyday after school. Parents also might not like there kids being stressed over school work. Kids all ready have to stay at school for 7hours a day if they stay after its like 9 hours a day. Also as you get older you get tired easier so them 8th grade kids are going the go to sleep when they get home and forget about there homework and they might not even eat. I think parents would like to see there kids at the dinner tables and not sleep all day.\n\nNow let me tell you how this all adds up. First you have to find a activity then you get cut from sports and you cant find the right club. Then you finally find a club but turns out you dont like the club and you have to do it all year. Then you come home all stressed out because you dont like the club and have a lot of work to do and you tired. So then you get to sleepy so you take a nap but you sleep to long now you didnt finish the homework that you were going to turn in the next day. Now you have a bad grade and your mom is on your case about your work now your even more stressed. Then you quit the club because you so stressed out.

      "I agree because kids should be more physical and should get more excuise in, and the main reason i argee for the principal to make all the kids participate is because so they have some else to do in school other than work and sitting down all day . I think it will help kids get the understanding about sport and working on something, when they get older so what they meant to do and help people. my decision is that the principal should do that more because it will help kids be more better at thing like that so if they ever wanna play sport or anything they know that you have to participate in everything we do.\n\nActivity are fun thing thing to do with people and at school cause it enoyable and fun to do, i really think the principal should do that at every school and the principal is right all kids can participate in sport or work is because it keep kids busy and it have kids doing some extra instead of all the kids sitting in the house or just doing nothing and i think it the right think to do is becuase they can get to express more thing in the world and kids can see more other just not doing nun but being in the house sleep and it will make kids understand life more. I hope that csn get kids in a better place when they grow up and they wanna do stuff on there wn wy amd i think it be nick to do some with them kids as a young as to do do physical sport or work somewhere but it be better to start young and contiune when they get older and stuff,\n\nBut the principal is help alot of kids to do think they wanna start trying to do when they get older and I feel like yes that be an great thing to do at a certain age and kids get be participateing in alot of stuff now days . I think it get better and better if kids do it and get use to it because alot of kids are not gonna wanna do nothig because they just wanna stay in the house and get on there phone and not gonna wanna do anything is it would be alot nicer if the principal help out the parent and tell the kids they can aleast particpate in a physical sort or work or do anything they would like to do but they gonna have to participate in somethin but not nothing and i think it be good. I would like to see kids do better in life and do better than what there parent was doing at a young age it would be a thing and something they could do and they can get there own car house and all that and if tha kids like that they prolly can go to college and go to school for that activity and prolly can be a teacher or a manger for whatever they like when they was doing as kids. And it kinda help me out cause it like i like to do physicla thing and like to help people work or anything they need help doing and it like i would like to do it and i seem like an awesome thing to do. And i feel like more thing should enter this world so kids can eneter more thing to do and get into more thing as like an 'Jobs , daycares , and help the community out i think that would be a great think to do the most impoortan thing is how i feel about it or what my decision is about the principal had decided for th kids to participate in school or outdoor activity i think yes the principal should because the kids will prolly learn more from it then just do anything and like in a school activity they could be in a yearbook club , track team ,cheerleader , or any type of sport they are happy or anything to do.\n\ngirl or boys can do anything wanna do any sport or more and i think they should wanna do sport cause it got stuff they like and like to do and it keep alot of kids busy to do and i would like to do that to cause i like to work and do sport so for me for myself i would be helpful thing to do . Like everyday kids should do some to help them be better it can be anything i could be running , walking help you family do stuff for the house go shopping do some other than sport and wanna play all day like the game or wanna fight and bully people i think it time just to help the community out and treat everybody as a family because it not alot of people and now days people wanna play sprt get a good and nice job and wanna do alot and i would like to do tracka and be a dancer cause that what i wanna do and my job i would like to do is be a lawyer and something that can help school and everything else , and if the principal would do that i would be a smart great thing to do in that school cause it teaching kids a lesson to do better in life and help kids out , that be a great idea to do . and if i was the princpal i would do the same thing to .",

      "Imagine you're sitting at home, watching a show, and your mom says \"Go outside, and play with your friends.\" The problem for you is that you don't know a lot of kids out of school, so you have nothing to do but stay inside. That is just one of the consequences of not participating in after school activities. You don't know what you've been missing out on, so you don't think it's that big of a deal when you pass a poster in the hall, advertising a new club. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can interact with others, they will be off their phone screen, and it will look good on their applications.\n\nStudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's a good way to interact with others. Making friends can be really hard for some people while for others it can be the easiest thing to do. Joining a club can help with making a friend because the people in the club have the same interests as you. Once you've made a couple friends, you can develop your social skills like leadership, and confidence. If you join an after school program, you'll be able to make friends and have stronger social skills when talking to others.\n\nStudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will be off your phone screen. Yes, we all like binge watching our favorite shows, but it has to come to an end at some point in the day for us to be able to do our work and hang out with friends. When you stay after school you're not on your phone, scrolling down social media to see what your friends are doing. You are with your friends and talking to them. You may not notice it, but over time, your vision will get worse from staying on your phone for too long. So, when you stay after school, and your phone is packed away in your backpack, that helps your health. If join an after school club you will be more aware to your surroundings, and not stuck to your phone.\n\nStudents must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will look good on their applications. When universities look at your grades, they also look to see if you participated in other activities. For example, if you joined a club that had to do with public speaking, universities would think that you're able to present in front of a class, and jobs would think that you would do well in customer service. All these small things help you in your future. When you join an after school club, you will be able to have a lot of activities on your applications.\n\nStaying after school for clubs and activities will help you now, and in the future. It's getting you prepared for the life after school ends. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can interact with others, they will be off their phone screen, and it will look good on their applications. So, the next time your mom says \"Go outside and play with your friends.\" You don't have to worry about who to call and hang out with because you've made friends at school.",

      "Can a activity outside school be helpful for students? An outside school activity for students may sound boring or too much work for them or requires too much of their time and energy, but they don't know that doing an outside school activity can benefit them in many ways. Such as, it helps them release stress, refresh their mind, be more active, productive, have a better social life and can lead them out of their comfort zone. Students can create a new way to live their life. They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.\n\nIf more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just have a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.\n\nDoing any activity outside school also work makes people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind their goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discover and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outside the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physically and it makes he or she have a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence it's family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influence other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the you or them have changed so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.\n\nLike always everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most common problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.  ",

      "It's the last play of the State Championship you have the ball at midfield your going as fast as you can go but you know your not fast enough to out maneuver the defender insight but, you sidestep and the defender goes flying past and you walk into the end zone untouched to win the game. You look up into the stands and you see your entire town chanting your name then, you look back down to the sideline and you see your team, your brothers coming towards you and they lift you up on their shoulders and in that moment you feel like your the king of the world. This is what goes through your head as you hear your principal inform the whole school that everyone has to participate in a extracurricular activity. I agree that everyone should have to participate in a activity because there are so many good things that can come from them. Here are some reasons I suggest that it is vital for someone to participate in a extracurricular activity.\n\nLeadership is one of the most used traits people use it is vary important in your everyday life and in general it's a good character trait to have. First things first you need leadership skills in school let's say your put into a group with some people for a group project. Subsequently, no one is motivated to do any work so you take the reins and you jump right in and you start assigning people objectives to meet. With your leadership skills your group gets an A+ for the project all because you took charge. Another reason leadership is important is in sports if you play a position like me goalie, you always have to be controlling the defense or say your the quarterback of the football team you have to be able to communicate with the team and tell them the plays and control the offense. Most important of them all is when your an adult and you have to mange a small group of workers, you assign a worker project to complete by next week. That worker doesn't turn the project in on time and your boss gets mad at you because you were supposed to be managing it and making sure it is done on time.\n\nHaving friends in Middle School and High School are important for every kid, teen, and even adults. New kids struggle every day trying to make friends with others and people have already been friends for 3 year now. A great way for people to make friends with people is through extracurricular activities. Because, the new person and the people in the club or sport share the same interests they have a way to talk to each other. When I first moved to Generic_School I had no clue who any of these people were but, when football season came around and I signed up my team became my second family I knew them like brothers and we stayed together for years.\n\nSome parents won't be happy with the change to their kids schedule but, that is expected when you are making kids do stuff that is new to them. But, when you look at major cities like New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan extracurricular actives are changing their cities for the better. It's keeping the kids off the streets and they are less likely to have been roped into gang related activities. Even kids mortality rate has dropped rapidly since cities have implemented rules that make kids join sports teams or clubs. That shows that making kids do extracurricular activates has helped kids in bad areas stay safe and have a higher chance of making something of their lives.\n\nIn this passage I have presented you with some reasons I agree that is vital for schools to implement the rule that all students have to participate in extracurricular activities. This rule will forever change schools in the up and coming years for the better. I suggest that all schools should have this rule implemented for safety and to help their kids build social skills, leadership skills for them to use in their futures. This rule would show kids competitive environments because that's what it is like in the real world.          ",

    ESSAY:
      "Extracurricular activities, which are activities you can participate in and enjoy the things you would want to do after school such as sports, writing, and any after school activities your school can offer for the students. You're able to choose when and which after school activities you want to go too, but should every student be obligated to participate in extracurricular activities. Why students shouldn't be obligated to take part of an extracurricular activity. After school activities are something you should enjoy and not something to be forced to do and here's why. Some students might have a lot of stuff going on while they aren't at school. Students might also not like participating in after school activities due to no interest in the activities. Possibly students could see extracurricular activities as more stressful than fun.\n\nA students' time after school could be very valuable and partaking in after school activities could always be very time consuming. Sure after school activities could be an hour or two but what if a student has other important things to do out of school. A student could be participating into other activities like sports and might not have time to do homework or study and on top of that being obligated to stay after school. A student might also have pets or siblings to take care of, which would be more important than an after school activity. An obligated extracurricular activity would just be time consuming and might not fit into a students' schedule. The school should understand that students also need time at home because seven hours of learning in school is as already as hard as it is, and then having to go to an after school activity would just make the situation even worse.\n\nThere could also be no after school activities a student might have interest in. Some students might have interests that the after school activities doesn't offer them. Even if it's just working on the school year book, an after school activity must be something a student should enjoy after school, not just being forced to do extra work. Just like anything you would want to do, you would participate and join it because you wanted to, and not because of obligation or force too. Just forcing a student to stay after school for something they don't want to do would just make the student dislike school even more. Students should enjoy doing what they want after school which might not even be an extracurricular activity.\n\nStress would also partake in students having to be obligated to stay after school for extracurricular activities. After a long day at school students would just want to head home and relax from school. Worrying about having to stay after would just cause the student to be more stressed. What if a student didn't have a ride to get back home from after school activities or they were scared of being at school longer, then what would they do in that situation? In case these situations happen what should the solution be? Well since these issues could happen from obligation of partaking in an extracurricular activity, then the only solution should be that after school activities should not be obligated and only stay optional for the better.\n\nWhy students shouldn't be forced to participate after school activities. There are many reasons why a student shouldn't be obligated to participate in after school activities and why it should stay optional. Staying after school could stress a student out due to obligation of staying at school for an hour or two more. A student can have other things they do outside of school that after school activities can take time away from it. A student might even dislike the activities at the school and would not enjoy their time of staying after school which is the opposite of what after school activities are about. Staying after school is something that's optional and something you can enjoy doing. All concluded which is the reason why school activities shouldn't be a must.",

    ESSAY:
      'A few weeks ago, a priest said to me, "Go the second mile." That sentence really hit me. I asked myself if I was giving back to the world as much as the world gave me. I\'m sure you know that going the second mile means don\'t do the minimum, go above and beyond. I thought adding this short story would be important because sometimes kids just wanna do the minimum of going to school and then going home. I think that every kid should do at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you succeed with your academic life, do exercise, and have fun.\n\nFirst, I think that extracurricular activities can help you succeed with your academic life. For example, you can go to a math club if that is what you need help with. This demonstrates that doing extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject. For instance, you can get help from your teacher or coach on a subject that they might know more than you about. This shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to get more help on subjects you might need extra help with. Also, going to an extra class or activity can help you minimize your laziness by having not just to go there, but to complete the work you are given there too. My examples are all evidence of why extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject.\n\nSecond, extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise. For example, you can join a basketball team or soccer team. Joining any sports team would help you do exercise by playing with your teammates and practicing. For instance, you can join a math club, memory club, or any other type of academic club that can help you think and answer questions. This demonstrates that joining and academic club can help you exercise your brain by thinking and answering questions. Another way extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise is by doing community service for your teachers. Doing community service like cleaning tables or organizing the library is a way to do exercise because you are constantly moving your arms and legs. In this paragraph I showed you how extracurricular activities can help you work your muscles and exercise your brain.\n\nFinally, extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun. For example, you can hang out with your friends. Hanging out with your friends and doing an activity together can not only strengthen your friendship but also can be an excellent way to have fun. For instance, going to a basketball club or a club you really like can be an amazing way to have fun. This is because you get to do an activity that you love not just by your self, but with other people that love it too. Another piece of evidence that shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun is by meeting new people and making friends. Meeting new people and making friends is always fun if you let it be, so it demonstrates that extracurricular activities are a really good way to have fun. Every piece of evidence I wrote here are excellent examples of why extracurricular activities can bring you joy and happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you do better on a subject, help you work your muscles and brain, and bring you joy and happiness. Go try an extracurricular activity with your friends. In case you don\'t like the activities in your school, ask to make a new one. They are always worth the trouble. A very wise religious leader once told me, "Go the second mile." I found those words to be the greatest I have ever been told.',

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.\n\nAs we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This may also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.\n\nOur parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whether it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lot of money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.\n\nWhen it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.\n\nExtracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and can take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.",

      "Extracurricular Activities are like music; some people like it, others do not. The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree, for the students may be shy, busy, or have money problems at home.\n\nTo begin with, students could be shy. Being shy and put on the spot in front of a group could build anxiety or stress. If they work better alone, being apart of any extracurricular activity means that you work with other kids.\n\nThe students may not be athletic, or may not like the clubs the school offers.\n\nFor instance, if a student is shy and he or she has to work with a group and express ideas, or if they join a team and have to do certain tricks, their anxiety and stress may increase.\n\nAlso, children can be busy, they have a life outside of school just like everyone else.\n\nThey might have to take care of others.\n\nWhen taking care of others its hard to go to a club or sport after school, because when you get home your tired from your long day .\n\nThat is not fare to the students because when they get home they will be tired, have to do homework, and take care of somebody.\n\nThe kids may have appointments, like doctors appointments dentist appointments, or therapy appointments.\n\nSome appointments can be every night, depending on the circumstances but no one should miss their appointment.\n\nFor example, a students has therapy appointments three times a week with his therapist he should not have to miss his appointments for any club or sport.\n\nIn addition, kids may have money problems. They might not have a car, or money to get transportation. They probably do not walk home because by the time for them to leave it would be dark and their parents do not want them to walk home.\n\nIf they join a club they might have to buy a shirt, or if they join a team they might not have money for uniforms.\n\nSpecifically, if a student does not have transportation at home, and does not have money for other transportation, then he would not be able to go.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not think that having an extracurricular activity is needed for all students. I think this unfair, granted that they can build social skills, and spend less time on electronic devices.\n\nIn my opinion they should not be forced to join a extracurricular activity. I think they should encourage it but not force it.",

      "Have you wanted a to hit a soccer ball and make a goal or win a debate tournament at your school. Students who want to try-out sports or debate find an extracurricular at their school. Having at least a extracurricular is a good idea to have when you are looking for something new at your school or club. Students who are engaged with the extracurricular are going to more focus on other topics. Extracurricular is a great way to keep students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends.\n\nHaving a extracurricular helps keep students active. Most students are on their phone all the time,so by having students participate in a extracurricular prevents them on their phone. I have done an extracurricular in my school, that has help forget about my phone and instead focus on more important on my softball team. Keeping students active on extracurricular helps them focus on the extracurricular they are doing. There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active.\n\nAn extracurricular has different options to tryout. Trying out a extracurricular can be hard to choose. When you are trying out extracurricular you should find talents or skills that you are good at to find the perfect extracurricular. When I had to find a extracurricular I to choose activities that I am good at, or extracurricular that is joy able. Extracurricular is fun to explore out what kind of activities you are good and most joy able.\n\nSocializing with your friends is fun when you can hang out with your friends in a extracurricular. Socializing with your friends can be extracurricular, for example like a girl or boy's club or a book club can be ways of an extracurricular. Another, way you can socialize with your friends is making new friends in extracurricular. You to meet other people that might want to be friends with. I have friends and made friends in a book club while talking about the book and relevant topics.\n\nHaving at least one extracurricular is a great to keep students active on the activity, finding different extracurricular's and socializing with your friends and making new ones. Keeping students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends are different ways of enjoying extracurricular and engaging students to themselves the activity that their are really interest into. So what I think about students participating in a extracurricular in school is that students should have an opportunity to have at least one extracurricular. ",

      "Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? Probably so, it'll be beneficial to them.\n\nI think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it'll give them a new experience, they'll meet new people, and depending on the activity, it can help them develop their future.\n\nAn after school activity can give you a new experience, but how? Sometimes, you might not know exactly what you like, so an extracurricular activity could help you learn more about yourself. I mean, even if you dont like it you'll know not to do it again, right? Besides learning more about yourself, trying something new can just be good for you, especially if what you're doing is a sport or something that'll develop your future. Well, maybe your friends might want to brag to others that they were on the football team when they graduate. A sport or even an art activity could help you if you're applying to a job, but it would also give you, in a way, work experience, especially if you're applying to a job that is related to that activity when you're older. Even if you might not like the activity, it will be beneficial to you at some point.\n\nMeeting new people can benefit students. Sometimes, you might not have many friends who have the same hobbies, but when you're joining an activity, especially if it's something that you like, there's bound to be people that have the same hobbies. Who knows, maybe you might find a really good friend there. Meeting new people can make connections, connections are good to have when you're older and you might have a specific job to do. Maybe you might just need something and you remember your friend from that activity became a pretty great manager of a popular company. Usually, when you're joining an extracurricular activity, there's going to be people who are older than you and they have more experience in the activity you might've joined, it would be helpful to you to learn what they have been taught. It's good to learn from other perspectives, don't you think? Making new friends and meeting new people could ease stress with coming up tests, they'll help you relax a little more.\n\nWell, what if students don't want to participate? It can be difficult for a student to participate if something is happening outside of their school life. Sometimes, students might not be able to participate because of family, work, money, or time. There's a point in time where they will have to make exceptions. Besides that, usually it seems like the students around here might not do much outside of school, so they'll be kept a little busy with an activity.\n\nMy final thought is that, of course, students should participate because they'll meet new friends, maybe even learn some new skills, and develop themselves and their future. So, go ahead and join an activity, you could really learn from it!",

      "Imagine going home and doing nothing but work, work, and more work. Being cooped up in the house and the only thing you could do is homework for hours. I think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. They will have the chance to do something that makes them happy. Something that will let their brain take a break from working so hard during school.\n\nStudents will be able to make new friends and meet new people. Before I came to middle school I only knew the people from my elementary school and that was it. Until I joined chorus, I made friends with people that enjoyed music as much as I did. It was so much fun to be around new people and to make new friends. Even though we would have to stay after school to practice for up coming concerts it was still worth it. It gave me something to do after school and I could let my brain take a break from comprehending all the learning tactics that I have come across in school. I got the opportunity to do the one thing that makes me happy almost everyday. If students participate in an extracurricular activity it will give them a chance to open up to new people that may stay with them for a long time in their life.\n\nStudents will have something fun to do after school. They would get to enjoy something fun that they may want to continue in their future. It gives them a chance to relax and enjoy the things they love to do outside of school. It will be a more enjoyable experience when they are doing something that really makes them happy. One of my friends loves to play sports and it makes her really happy. She was not worried about homework or getting something done right when she got home. Instead she got the chance to let her mind rest from all the learning and power on the part of her brain that helps her enjoy the sport that she loved. Students will have a better time concentrating on there homework after they have had time to relax by doing extracurricular activities.\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to learn something new whether it is a new instrument or a new sport. Every day in school you learn new things in all subjects but it is all surrounded around test and quizzes. But when a student decides to take an extracurricular activity they can learn something that will make them much happier and that does not involve test or quizzes. When I was in fourth grade I decided to start playing the violin. I understood that it was a big responsibility taking on something outside of school but it was worth it. I have always loved playing the violin and I continue to play it now. Also I had to stay after school multiple times to practice with everyone in the orchestra. I learned how to make my brain stronger by doing something that was at a different level of difficulty in a different way.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. Students might discover something new about themselves that they did not know before they decided to take and extracurricular activity. Students should not have to work so much and not have any time to themselves. Everyone needs time to relax and do the things they love. By relaxing they give their brain a break to recharge and get ready for all the work that will come in the future.",

      "Student's usual school day lasts about 6-8 hours. After school, students usually like to kick back and relax. Some student's might actually have things to do after-school, like sports or schoolwork. However, if they're principal takes that privilege away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.\n\nStudents also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.\n\nBeing required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work. Late assignments will increase, which will bring down student's grades very quickly. More missing work will increase, too, which will bring their grade down even more. Adding more after-school activities, whether it's academic or not, will cause students unnecessary stress.\n\nSo whats the issue? After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.",

      "Your Principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Do you agree? Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills, build life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. Yes, i think that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nExtracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills. Many people have various forms of social anxiety or they may just be naturally shy, but bonding over something you both enjoy doing can build true friendships that can last a lifetime. For example, i'm a competitive dancer, and i remember when i first stared dancing, i was shy and didnt like to do anything that was out of my comfort zone. Now i've been dancing for almost 9 years and my favorite people are my friends at my dance studio. While i started off shy and scared to talk to new people, i have become best friends with the people i was shy around, i believe if everyone does a club or activity, everyone would have amazing friendships like mine.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to build social skills and a great way to build life skills too. soccer is a sport that builds control, endurance, and good sportsmanship, while a club like Beta club, is a club that builds leadership skills and gives you the opportunity to help those around you. There is something different with every activity, if you try and find a club or activity that helps to build the skills you are interested in or skills you would like build, then you might just end up having a good time and it might just be something you'll want to do as a profession.\n\nClubs and Activities are a great way to build social skills, build life skills,and also a great way to enhance your future. Clubs and activities will build skills you will use for the rest of your life. If you do a academic club, you might win first place in a really big category, that win will look really good on your college application. If you do a sport, college scouts might be at your game and they might recognize you and give you a free scholarship to a college and maybe that college will be one you really wanted to go to. Clubs and activities can benefit your future in so many more ways then you might think.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to build social and life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. when your principle asks you if your going to do an extracurricular activity, what will you say?",

    ESSAY:
      "Imagine you are at your high school graduation, your name gets called up and every one in your grade chants your name. You have came far for this opportunity to go to a top notch university. You would think that it was all of your teachers that helped you. But then you forget about your Math and Science Olympiad coaches, your basketball coach. I believe that schools need extracurricular activities. If my principal told made a rule that every one single one of the kids had to do a extracurricular activity, I would most likely sign up in at least two or three activities. The reasons why I think this are, You can learn Important life skills, you gain knowledge of things you didn't know before academically, and it can sometimes be fun.\n\nMy first reason why you should have these activities were that you can learn a bunch of life skills that would very useful in the future. Like teamwork. Teamwork is a very important skill you need to learn. In the future when you get a job. You will need to work with your coworkers. Sometimes you know your coworker an other times you will get paired with someone you will not know. It is always very important to know how to work with other and communicate with them when necessary. My second example is that it teaches time management. When I was in Odessy of the Mind, I had little to know time to do my homework. So I would do my homework at school and not worry about it when I would get home. This is why so you can just chill in you home or do other priorities. Third and final example is Responsibility. Let's all be honest. We all learn responsibility when we were very young. I learned it before I started Preschool. I will give you an example on why responsibility is so important. You are playing football. You are the center. Your job is to snap the ball to the quarterback and block the big defensensive tackles and linebacker. If you don't do you are responsible for, then the quarterback will get tackled for a lose of yards, or he will get hurried to throw the ball and will throw a bad pass. This is why this skill is so important. You need to what your job is and how to do it.\n\nMy second reason why you should have these activities is that you gain knowledge academically. When you go to a extracurricular activity to do with math or science, you will learn new things from an academical standpoint. Take math for an example. Let's say you are in 6th grade. You are talking an after school math advanced math class. Your teacher teaches you the Quadratic Formula. Look at you now, you are in 6th grade and you know how to do quadratics. Also, take science for an example. They teach you a ton of things, maybe you are in 7th grade and talking an extracurricular class of physics. Great job, now you know what a black hole is. Okay, my last example is that you are in student council, now you know how to stand up and talk to people and know how rules get passed. I could list hundreds of examples. But you can only do this if you have a positive mindset and be there only if you want to be there.\n\nMy third and final reason is that you actually have a lot of fun. If you play a sport such as football and basketball, you get excited and have a ton of fun, Sometimes when in an extracurricular class, you have fun time learning new things that you are interested in learning. You can sometimes have a lot of fun and learn things academically to. You can reduce stress and anxiety, and it can exercise your brain. So from an entertainment standpoint. Extracurricular activities are really good.\n\nWell I believe that Extracurricular activities are very useful and great de to these three reasons, They teach you very important life skills, they teach you things from an academical standpoint, and the third and last reason was that they are really fun. Extracurricular activities are no classes that you have to get an A on. They are classes the you inquire knowledge out of. They are their to give you the knowledge that you need.",

      "\"well not all people like to do other things.\" Joining a different activity is not what a lot of people like to do very much. Kids dont really talking in front of a lot of people because they could be shy or anything. When kids do a extracurricular activity they could agree with people and disagree with people because everyone don't have the same opinion. So I disagree because some could get hurt doing sports , they go visit family and they don't have time to do anything and people is not an out door person and don't talk that much.\n\nKids could get hurt doing sports , like I was younger at my dad football practice and a boy pop his bond out of place so they call the ER and he had to get things done. Most kids hurt they self though out the year when they're doing sports because they could of been doing things wrong so they hurt themselves. Most people don't like going outside and doing that much activity or like playing sports. A lot of kids like to be healthy if they going to play a sports or anything and they keep their body in shape. Students shouldnt have have participate in a activity if they dont want to and i dont thing they should get force too if they dont want to do it at all.\n\nMost kids don't often go and visit they family so some kids go on trips and visit they family if they don't see them and things. It's good that kids go see they're family, also and kids are shy, they don't talk to people or they're not an outdoor person so they stay in the house and don't talk to no one. It would take up kids time if they want to go visit they family so I think kids should go visit they family if they don't see them that often and if they want to spend time with them. Most people worry about they family so they don't have time to go visit their family that much. Like my family that live far but not that far away from me i would go visit them and still be in things.\n\nEven tho kids are not an outdoor person or dont talk to that much people it they still dont have to do something they dont want to. Kids dont like staying after school for sports or anything only if its something fun and your helping out thats what kids like to do. Doing something could help but students shouldn't have to just do it if they dont want to and its theyre choice if they want to do it or not they dont have to get force to. A lot of kids just dont talk or nothing and they don't do nothing but talk to they friend or stay in the house and not do nothing. Most kids dont even have that much friends they could do or nothing so most kids dont do after school activitys.\n\nKids just don't go outside or don't do something because they could get hurt or anything. Most kids love doing an activity with their school and then other kids just dont like doing something at all. So I disagree because kids shouldnt have to do something they dont want to do if its in school or out of school. They also dont have to be/get force to do anything. A lot of other kids are like teachers pet and do a lot for teachers and even help out with a lot of teacher with a lot of things . Kids are shy to even do extracurricular activity like help with year books , do sports or anything, most kids dont even see their family like they'er opposite to so kids dont do other activity or sports like that.             ",

      "My principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with what my principal said about how we must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first benefit is students could be forced into something that they actually love. The second thing is students could be really good at something and just not know. And last is kids can get really lazy sometimes and making them do something can make their life a lot better.\n\nFirst, students could get forced into something they actually love. If a student decides to play a sport for their activity then they could end up really liking it. The students could end up playing that sport for the rest of their life. If they like that sport and keep playing then they could meet new friends. Overall, extracurricular activities can create great experiences.\n\nSecond, Students could be really good at something and just not know. Is someone has never played a sport Then they dont know how good they could be at it. I have a friend that had never played basketball And when he first tried the sport it turns out hes good. Any person that tries a new sport could end up playing with the pros, all you have to do is just try the sport. In the end, being forced to do something could reveal a talent.\n\nLastly, kids can get really lazy at times and by forcing them to do and extracurricular activity can change their life. For instance, if they have weight issues then you could sign them up for a sport so they can loose some of that weight. Also by making them do an activity it can change a persons view on a certain group of people and maybe make them want to do what those people do. By playing something as a kid can make that person as an adult have a stronger work ethic. In conclusion, doing extracurricular activities as a kid can help you as an adult.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities can help find and create good things for you in life. My first example is students could get forced into something that they actually like. Second, kids can be very talented at something and just not know it. And lastly, kids can get really lazy and by forcing them to do these activities can make them into a new person. By making students do extracurricular activities you can help a lot of kids.",

      "Do you agree or disagree that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity? Well i believe that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity because it creates bonds and builds teamwork skills.\n\nExtracurricular activities create bonds by forcing students to join with one another in a group project so they will make friends among the group. Students will be able to further improve their passion for the activity for example I found out about the D&D club at my school I went to one of their sessions and found out that I really had a passion for the game, I am still enjoying it to this day.\n\nExtracurricular activities build teamwork skills by making students work together to get a task done. For example when I was in D&D me and my group were in a forest when we saw a dead horse on the road two of my teammates were squinting to try and see the details, another one of my teammates was booking it to the horse to try to see what happened and I'm just standing their thinking to my self what are these nut jobs doing then suddenly the teammate who was booking it got jumped by goblins I forced a fire bolt at one of the goblins, one of my other teammates is playing ping pong with his short bow, another one puts a knife in a goblins back, the paladin smashes his hammer on one of them, and the wizard throws acid at one we took them all out but the one who booked it died the end.\n\nWhat should have been taken away from this is that being part of an extra curricular activity helps make bonds and encourage teamwork skills, do you agree or disagree that studets must be in a extracurricular activity.",

      "Your principal has decided all students need to participate In at lest one extracurricular activity this year do you agree or disagree with this decision?\n\nI disagree, because a lot of students have siblings to take care of, some of there families won't let them do sports as well as there parents may work to late to come get them after a game or practice.\n\nFist, a lot of students have to go home and take care of there brothers and sisters because their parents work to late so therefor how are you going to have time to play a sport who's going to take care of your little brother and sister? As a result of this you will not have time for the activity your principal wants you to do. You have to go home and cook your family dinner because dads not around and mom works 12 hour shift so you know she's going to be to extremely tired and she's not going to want to cook so It's your job now you're going to feed mom and or your brother or sister. If you have to play sports how are you going to feed them?\n\nSecond, you always take care of your sibling so how do think your mom is going to feel if you come home and say, \"mom I have to play a sport for school or I'm going to get In trouble.\" your moms going to be upset she does not want you to play sports because she does not have the money nor time to take you and pick you up she wants to go home and sleep. She has to have your help with your brother or sister because she has no one else to help her and she does not have the money for a babysitter after school.\n\nLastly, she works extremely to late to take you to a game or practice she just does not have the time, sports can be hard for people and be overwhelm and that's a lot if you're going through family problems. Your mom works to late to get you and pick you up and take you there It's a lot of stress on both you and your mom.\n\nTherefor this is why I disagree with students having to do an extracurricular activity also, older kinds are vary responsible and take a lot of roll In the family trust me I know from experience I never had time to play sports always took care of my brother and the family through hard times.",

      "Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involved with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagree to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family.\n\nMy first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worried about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved.\n\nThere for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates.\n\nMy final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no one wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did. But in the other hand there are kid that only see their parents once cause they come from work very late and go to work very early and you have to go to sleep cause there is school the next day. It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club.\n\nThis is why i disagree that student should have to participant in an activity. There are so many stuff that student might have to do out of school that makes them not be able to join a club,sport or any other activity that they offer in the school.              ",

      "Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn't have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name's alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, \"Are you on your way to football practice?\" \"Unfortunately,\" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn't bad at football, he just didn't enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn't because too many people who didn't want to participate signed up. \"How's the student council?\" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. \"I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,\" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn't have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn't enjoy it as much because those who didn't want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn't have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren't interesting to them. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.\n\nThe first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students' after school activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after school activities.\n\nAnother reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they're being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won't be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn't interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren't provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don't wish to participate.\n\nIn addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don't want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you're on a team, whether it's a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn't putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who's not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they're interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyable if a student doesn't participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.\n\nGeneric_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team's effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. \"Guess what?\" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. \"What?\" Generic_Name replied curiously. \"I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!\" \"Congratulations, Generic_Name,\" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, \"See you later, Generic_Name.\" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn't have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team's effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students' after school activities, it would be a burden on the students who don't want to participate, and it wouldn't be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.",

      "How many times have you stepped out of your comfort zone? Maybe once or twice? People always hold back in life from doing something they have wanted to do. Maybe they are scared or fear of being judged. They don't take opportunities when they have it and might regret it later. Having to do another extracurricular activity could open so many doors, for example, meeting new friends, trying something new, and maybe even finding something you're really good at.\n\nYou know when you meet a new friend, you're so excited and can't wait for all the fun things you guys will do together! If you did an extracurricular you could have so many of these moments. Making new friends expands your friend group. You can meet people that you probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been pushed to stretch your horizons. And all these people can introduce you to new things that they are interested in like their favorite movie, books, or even their own friends. You could do the same. At this point you might even have double the friends you had before you even did this extracurricular, wouldn't that be fun! Making new friends is just one of the many aspects of trying something new!\n\nFor most people their is always that one thing they want to try but never do. Maybe chorus, art, robotics, etc. When you do this extracurricular you finally get the chance to do that one thing you've always had in the back of your mind. Say you tried this new thing, you put in your all in it, and you didn't like it or you weren't good at it. That's OK! Now you know that you tried it. You have no regrets. And you're probably going to have fun along the way even if it didn't end up being your passion. Doing this extracurricular could get you to the activity you always wanted to do even if it's not your life's calling.\n\nMy dad always says, \"Don't knock it till you try it.\". Which basically means don't say you don't like it till you have given it a shot. This applies to so many things like sports, food the list goes on. This activity that you try could be what your really talented at. Maybe not given the opportunity you have never tried it. That would be so sad, getting a talent and you don't even know that you have it. That would just be a waste! If you get an opportunity like this it could lead to many things and even find what you were meant to do.\n\nTrying something new, making friends, and discovering what you're really good at is just a few of the possibilities if you do an extracurricular. Trying something different could open your world, and make you see things in a different light that maybe you looked down on before. You could finally find that one interest that you've been waiting for. And maybe that you're really good at too! Having to do another extracurricular helps you find friends and broadens your friend group! I really think that adding an extracurricular will benefit teens in many ways and really make them branch out which they probably weren't doing in the first place. ",

      '" What are you going to choose?" That is the sound of a student at a school which requires them to do an extra- curricular activity. Students enrolled at this school must do some sort of extra curricular activity, whether it is a sport, a spot on the yearbook club, or serving on the student council. I agree with the requirement of an extra curricular activity because it can help you find people with the same interests and lead you to new interests, it can help create a better community environment and it will help all the students mature and succeed in the future.\n\nParticipating in an after school activity can lead you to people that have the same interests and can lead you to other interests. i have been playing lacrosse for about 8 years now and as I\'ve played throughout the years, I have discovered many different hobbies through my teammates such as cheer leading, track and field and rock climbing. I\'ve also been able to make friends because I\'m on a different team every season. I have made about 3 lifetime friends in lacrosse. I think this can happen with school lead activities. I think by being part of an after school activity, you can make lifelong friends, find people with the same interests and discover new hobbies.\n\nDoing an after school activity can help create a better community environment. this kind of relate back to the previous statement about making friends.\n\nby making friends, you can create less bullying. there is this saying, "strength in numbers", and I truly think this would happen with an after school activity requirement rule. By installing an activity requirement, you would help build a bully-free community.\n\nLastly, an after school activity would help students mature and prepare them for the future. I babysit a little boy with downs-syndrome and i often take him to the park. When we leave, you tell he is a little bit more mature from when we first arrived. this is because hen has played with older kids and have copied their actions. I believe this goes with all kids. if we had an after school activity program and we put all the grades together, it would help the younger one mature but also the older kids could teach them how to do things that they will need to know in the real world.\n\nI think everyone should be involved in some sort of group, whether it be school related or not. Maturing kids, better community environments and finding new friends can all happen with a required after school activity program.',

      'Do you think students will have time to do at lest one extracurricular activity after reading this? Doing an extracurricular activity might not always bring good things to students. This can affect students in a lot of ways with other things they do after school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time, they can have other activities after school, and students can get stressed and tired.\n\nTo begin with, one reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might not have time. Students will not have time to do their homework after school. They might not have time to finish a project they been signed or to study for a test. Students will not have time to go out and hang out with their friends or spend time with their families. For example, students will not have time to eat dinner with their families.\n\nNext, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might already do other activities after school. Students might already participate in after school sport but no play a school sport. If students are 15 years or older they can start working and some students might want a easy after school job. They probably want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school. For example, take dance classes or instrument classes.\n\nIn addition, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can get stressed and tired. If students get stressed their grades can go down and their parents can get mad. Students can get tired and sleepy in class and teachers will keep on saying, "keep your head up" during class. It will be hard for students to keep up with their work in class for example, they will not finish on time.\n\nFinally, students will not have time to finish their homework or projects they have and no time to be will their families and friends. They will want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school like other classes. If students do get into a extracurricular activity they can get stressed or tired and their grades might go down. This are the three reasons why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity after school.',

      "Imagine your principal said you had to participate in some type of extracurricular activity, how would you feel?\n\nWould you feel like you are being forced or unable to decide what you do in your life?\n\nWell, for many students this is happening to them.\n\nI disagree with this decision because, some students have things they have to do after school, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do, and some parents dont have the time nor the money to do extracurricular activities.\n\nFirst, some students have things they must do after school, at home some parents leave things for their kids to do that may prevent them from doing extracurricular activities.\n\nA parent relies on their kids to watch younger siblings so they dont get in trouble.\n\nIn the afternoon the students might have to go see or help a sick family member or friend.\n\nSometimes parents also leave lists of chores they expect the kids to be finished with before they arrive home, and its part of the kids responsibilities to get them done.\n\nAlso most teachers give out homework that the kids have to turn in next class, when these students have 6-8 classes and homework in most of then it may be hard to juggle anything else.\n\nSecondly, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do.\n\nSometimes kids just dont want to do something, it may be because of social life or their life at home.\n\nIts also their choice rather they want to do it or not, because its their mind and body.\n\nonly parents or guardians have the right to force their kids to do something, the school shouldnt be allowed to tell students they have to join extracurricular activities if the just dont want to.\n\nYour only a kid once and these students should be able to enjoy their childhood without having to cut out time for extracurricular activities they they are being forced to do.\n\nLastly, some parents or guardians dont have the time or money to let their child participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nSome parents only have enough money to pay the bills and keep foo on the table, they dont need to pay fees just so their child can participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nThe parent might not have the time off that they need to join the child in club meets or sports games, because they work long hours. Transportation may be a big issue, if the family has no way to get their child to the extracurricular activities then there is no need for the child to be forced to sign up for them.\n\nAlso club meet times, say if the parents live in the middle on nowhere and the kid has a club meet at five but the parents get off at seven the club times are not convenient for the family.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with this decision because, some students have things they have to do after school, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do, and some parents dont have the time nor the money to do extracurricular activities.\n\nWhy should a student have to do something when some families just cant afford it?\n\nDo you agree that students shouldnt be required to do extracurricular activities?         ",

      "Should students part take in a extracurricular? well I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because, it gets students more involved with his or her community and keeps students active and on their feet. This will teach students many skills that could benefit them in the future.\n\nFirst off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. For example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. Joining a sport discovered many things I didn't already know about myself. I learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. Therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.\n\nNext, Joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. This leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. For example, I joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my best friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into. That decision was one of the best choices i've ever made. In addition, You'll get to meet all kinds of people from around your community, learning more about them each day and everyday, how similar or how different they're from you. At the end of it, it is nice to see all different or similar types of people that are surrounding you in your daily life.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you should join an extracurricular because you can benefit so much off of it. Including many life skills that will help you such as, communication skills, leadership skills, listening skills and many more skills that will help you along your path. Getting to know the people around you is a nice experience that I think every person should have the opportunity to get.                 ",

A lot of students are already stressed about their regular classes and they are required to do an activity over top of everything?\n\nI strongly disagree with students having to do an extracurricular activity. We shouldn't have to do something we are not interested in. All you should have to do at school is learn. A bunch of students could easily get stressed out from everything.

      'Whenever you get home, do you do your homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don\'t then you are either a very responsible kid, or you have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and the other half go home and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because it teaches the students responsibility, helps them with college later on, and they won\'t be on their phones all day.\n\nOne reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach them to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while they are still in school, it will help them succeed in their later life as an adult.\n\nAnother reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can help with finding a college later on in life. If you chose a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really help you in the future when you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are really good at a certain sport by the time of your sophomore year, you probably have a very high chance of making it on your school\'s team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if they think you are good enough for their school, they will probably offer you either a full-ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that they can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by "earth gov" asked adults which college they went to and if they were involved in an extracurricular activity during their high school years. About 90% of adults said that they got into college due to a extracurricular they were involved in during high school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.\n\nOn the other hand, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. They already have enough stress as it is, we don\'t need to add extra weight onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can help teens not spend the entire after school time on their phones. The article "Are Phones Good for Teens" writes, "most of all teens have access to a smart phone, and once they are let out of school and get home, the average teen spends 5 to 76 hours on their phone instead of doing their homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities." Another article titled "Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College" states that "when kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat they are deeply involved in extracurricular activites like sports, working on their school\'s yearbook, or being on the student council of their school." If the universe was filled with more kids like these then the world would have a larger population of successful young adults than it has right now.\n\nIn conclusion all students should be obliged to be involved in extracurricular activities becuase it helps them learn how to be responsible in their future life, it can help student get into a good college and be successful in life, and it can keep students off of their phones all day. To save our earth, the first step is saving the future generation.',

      "Should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricular activities. Yes because they provide information and fun for the students. Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity because we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.\n\nExtracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.\n\nBy taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.\n\nBeing active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.\n\nExtracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends. Extracurricular activities help students make friends, learn about a specific subject, and stay active.",

      "If you were told that you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, how would you feel? While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them. Schools shouldn't take away student's after school time, that time is the only time that they get to relax.\n\nSchools have a limited option of extracurricular activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.\n\nA lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.\n\nAfter school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.\n\nWith all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.",

      'Why we can do what we want after hours.\n\nBy Generic_Name,\n\nThe idea of a mandatory after school or extracurricular activity is filled with huge flaws. From angry parents to legal trouble, this is me, "pouring gasoline onto the fire."\n\n1. Its a simple idea really. Make kids participate in extracurricular activities against their wills. More money to the school and things that college will look back on and say,\n\n"You were in the yearbook club in 8th grade, congratulations welcome to Harvard!"\n\nIn fact collages dont look at most things from middle school, colleges dont really care because middle school dost have college counting courses till about 8th grade. The things they look at are your activities in high school and your grades in high school along with your SATs. This means that depending on the school (middle or high school) this would be for no good reason than to give kids experience and make people pay money for their kids to participate in these extracurricular activities.\n\n2. This will make parents and kids mad. The addition of extracurricular activities means the violation of rights and possible putting people at health risks. Think about it, you miss a doctors appointment because you have to do this or suffer for not attending. You could have people with diabetes not have to correct things to eat after the extracurricular activity running them the risk of high or low blood sugar. Heart and lung conditions also. Its not good.\n\n3. Timing will be off put, if your already part of a sports team and try to balance two of them at once the intersecting times will get you in trouble on both side and will let your team down. Traffic will now be a problem considering students getting back near 5 or 6 and getting out in rush hour traffic. Meaning they get home later and and wont have enough time to work on important work they need for school. Not to mention not everybody can even attend after hour activities, doctors appointments, travel, family matters. This will spiral out of control fast causing parents and students alike to start taking action against the school.\n\n4. A revolt will happen, I\'m making this sound dramatic but it will. It will start with a majority of people saying "this is stupid" and not attending these extracurricular activities. This will start taking effect with everyone and now a lot of people will start leaving the extra curricular activities. Then you have to face the parents, very angry and annoyed phone calls saying "I cant pay for this!" or "We have no time on our schedule to deal with this!" Eventually if the mandatory extracurricular activities dont end or become optional. Parents will probably start filling complaints to the school board or Virginia legislators. Did i mention that keeping kids at school after hours against their will is literary kidnapping. An offense of the law. So this will end two ways, cancellation of the mandatory extracurricular actives by the school board or by VA legislation, or parents pulling their kids out of the school successfully lowering the productivity, ranking, and reputation of the school.\n\nSo after all of that, do you think its a good idea to make extracurricular activities mandatory? Ill lat you think about it.',

The reason why is because the students already have a lot going on for them they have 4 main classes they have to worry about Math, Science, English and Civics. Putting another class for them or activity is going to put a lot more weight on the students. For example if a student at the school has all AAP classes or honors classes they already have a lot on their mind to deal with for the student's classes like tests, projects and homework. Some students may already be participating in a activity outside of school like sports!\n\nI believe the students should have a choice to choose a extracurricular activity not to be obligated, because the students already have to deal with so much outside of school and in school too. Another reason why it's a bad idea is because the amount of time the students have.\n\nLets say they as in the students join the school football team they are most likey going to have practice after school and that takes up a lot of time from someone's day. They're going to have to stay after school to particpate in that activity. Now that narrows down the amount of time the student has to finish all their homework, assignments or other things the students do in their time. A add on to this something that is important to the students, The amount of energy they have. Energy is something that helps the students get through their days of school they need that to focus on what they are learning and keeps them awake in class. There is now a chance that the student is going to have to start staying up late to finish assignments because of the amount of time they now have in their day. This is going to have a huge impact on the student's life because now they are going to have less energy from how late they stayed up. It's going to cause the student to be more tired in class and is most likey going to fall asleep in class and they are going to miss out on the important information they need for that class.\n\nIn a persons life two things matter, their time and their energy. Without their time they aren't going to be able to get a lot of things done. Without energy they won't be able to finish much either because they're too tired to do anything. There's a lot of risk of putting another class onto the students these just being the main effects and risks they may have to a student's life",

      '"Get up and try something new," someone once said. Imagine if the local school had fun activities after school that got students minds off of all the stress in their lives. I agree with this statement because extra circulars can introduce new friendships and create fun while exploring hobbies.\n\nAfter school programs can provide new friends. Many people that join a club or school sport are just trying something that they haven\'t before and need some encouragement from a peer or someone to talk to. When I joined the school play last year it was a requirement to tryout. I was very nervous, but with the help of the rest of the cast I sang in front of a whole crowd and was cast a role. Sometimes there are students who are in the classes of others and may never talk to them, extra circulars are the perfect time to ask them questions and make them feel comfortable. In my History class there was a girl named Generic_Name, she was very shy but also very sweet. We rarely talked until we both joined the Best Buddies program and were partners for everything, we became very good friends and still talk to this day. Lastly, there is a chance to meet someone with similar interests as others. My mother met her best friend from the school basketball team when she was in junior high, they both loved basketball and continued to play together throughout high school. Extra curricular activities can bring together so many people and create new friendships.\n\nAfter school programs can bring so much excitement and joy into students lives by trying new hobbies. Extra circulars come in many forms such as; plays, art, sports, or even technology clubs. By joining a sports team the coaches provide fun activities while still exercising, and in a club like the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) the leaders teach life lessons and helpful skills. I am a NJHS leader and our goal is to plan meetings after school that others enjoy while being informed as well. In these programs there may be a hobby that people never knew they liked. My friend went to the field hockey interest meeting and learned all about the sport from real players, she had so much fun that she tried out for the high school team and made Varsity! The activities are also beneficial to more than one group of students. Some kids with disabilities stay after school waiting for a ride home from their parents, as a result programs were created for scholars to stay with them and help do entertaining projects. At many schools they have the "iCan Bike" club, a club also for kids with disabilities to learn how to ride a bike without training wheels, using help from student volunteers the club fund raises money for the Special Olympics. Extra curricular activities make trying new things fun and helpful.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These programs can help others meet new people that are similar to them and create enjoyment with taking part in new hobbies that will provide happiness.',

      "I disagree with the principal's opinion or option because not everyone likes the listed activities or sports, or they maybe might just not do sports at all. It should only be a list of people who are actually willing to participate and follow directions, not just participate because they have to or are being forced to. Sports aren't meant for everyone or you might not just have the ability to do sports, if the students decide to not participate in sports or the other options it shouldn't be a big deal,some may not want to do an extra class. The principal's choice or option really shouldn't be a must. There should be an agreement with students about it and if some agree they should add extra options. not just sports, Work on the year book, Or serve on the Student Council. That is really only three activities and there might be more but not exciting or just not fun to do. That's why it wasn't mentioned and there is a lot of moving in those few options which includes excercising. So therefore I totally disagree with The Principal's opinion or option of making it a Must do. It can affect people's attendance. They could skip that class because Either they hate it, Maybe not their thing or choice, And not just skipping the class. They maybe just won't come to school at all when they have to do the activity they chose. And that's not what the principal is trying to prove or achieve. The Principal wants excercising and moving but students don't. and also aswell complaining. Students may whine a lot to their teacher saying stuff like I don't want to be here or disrespecting The Teacher who gladly decided to help out. So in my opinion I think it's just better to keep it the way it is right now and not add the option of must do sports or the other activities.",

    ESSAY:
      "Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all\n\nGeneric_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students and tremendously decreases the time that a student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.\n\nGeneric_School students should not have to regularly participate in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.\n\nGeneric_School students should not have to consistently partake in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called \"Generic_Name's Work Zone\" or \"WWZ.\" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name's Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be. That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.\n\nI strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact.",

      'I disagree with the principles decision to force the kids to participate in extracurricular activities because, First some kids might not have time for the activities, secondly some kids have non school related activities, and lastly some kids may not like the activities they get to choose from. Generic_Name came home crying thinking about what the principal said in the assembly,"The teachers and I have come to the decision that everyone must participate in at least one extracurricular activity starting in two weeks." "I cant do that!", Generic_Name said crying on his bed. "I have travel soccer, and if I miss practice I\'ll get kicked from the team." Generic_Name put his hands over his face and said,"what am I going to do?" "I need to tell the principal that he cant make kids participate in school related activities." So Generic_Name sat down and started to wright.\n\nDear Principal Generic_Name, I got three reasons why you shouldnt force kids to do extracurricular activities. The first being some kids dont have time for the activity chosen, or given to them. For example, If you have a little sibling and your parents work late hours you have got to be there to take care of them. My friend is a good example of this because his parents always have late work hours, and so he needs to take care of his three sisters, But he cant do that if you make him do an extracurricular activity. My second example of this is my friend Generic_Name. He has very stricked parents and they dont allow him to stay at school past 3:45, and if he does he gets in big trouble.\n\nThe second reason being some kids have non school related activities. A lot of kids I know have sports after school and sometimes its there only fun of the day. Im a good example of that because, I have travel soccer after school and sometimes soccer is my escape from the teenage world. Another good example is my best friend Generic_Name. He plays travel hockey, and if he misses a certain amount of practices he will get kicked off the team and that will break his heart, so do you really want to be the one that breaks all thees kids hearts?\n\nThe theerd and final reason being that some kids may not like the activities that they have to choose from. For example a kid I know only likes the sport fencing, But unforchanetly the school doesnt provide that activity, so he will have to go and do another sport that he wont enjoy. The last example is a kid i know that doesnt even like sports. for instance she is not athletic, and she cant throw or ketch a ball, so she would be miserable in the activity shes in. To add on to this I saw her face after the assembly, she looked like she was about to cry. The point of me writing this is so people dont come to school and see all of the sad faces, and the last thing we want is a bad reputation of this great school.\n\nTwo days after Generic_Name turning in his essay he was called in to the principles office. "Generic_Name!", Mr Generic_Name said in a hard voice. "You make a good point in this essay." "Really?"Generic_Name, said in a surprised tone. "Indeed, I havent read an essay this good in a long time." "Im going to make a special announcement this morning about this, so make sure you are listing, OK?" "Yes seer", Generic_Name said with a big grin on his face, and went off to class. Wail Generic_Name was in class talking about what just happened the announcements came on. "Good morning everyone, I have a special announcement today." "I had a kid this morning come to me and widen my eyes about my decision at the assembly, and because of him I have changed my decision, so you dont need to participate in extracurricular activities if you choose not to." "Thank you Generic_Name, thank you." The hole school lit up in joy, and as the day came to an end,Generic_Name held his head up high and walked to his mom\'s car.        ',

      "Your sitting home alone with nothing to do wasting away with boredom, if so then you should do some extracurricular activity. I agree because, I think kids having to do extracurricular activities for school help them, and lets them help. These activities give kids things to do, may help them make friends, and gives them a chance to help others.\n\nFirst, extracurricular activities give young people something to do. This will get them out of their houses. These children have to go and help their team with the extracurricular activity that they chose. It will also make them use their brains. It teaches them to think outside of the box and to make creations from a thought. Lastly, it can also help them manage their time wisely. If they have other activities that give work or are near the same time, this will help them by learning what is more important or what they care more about. Some students might struggle to find time to do these activities, but they can chose what and when their activities should be.\n\nSecondly, these activities will help kids make new and lasting friendships. Make them work with others. Because these are all run by the school you will have to meet new people regardless, so why not try to make a lasting impression to the people you work with. Have them go on group outings. The children may not be friends with anybody yet and are looking for something to do, group activities are prefect, not only do you do fun stuff with your group, but also get to know them a bit better. They will help each other. If you have problems with home work or a problem with some one around school the others in your group can, and will help you with the problems that you may have. Kids may be shy and don't want to talk to others they don't know this will help them break the ice with a few people so they have some friends to hold them up.\n\nLastly, this gives them a chance to help others. They can help friends. if a friend needs help on understanding their part of the extracurricular activities or home work then you can help them to understand what they are suppose to do. You can help the school. If you are in student council and think of a way to better the school then you have the power to do what you think is right for the school and students. Finally, this give students a chance to help the community. The students could find ways to benefit the place where they live making it cleaner, safer, or in anyway better. If someone is having a hard time think of how good it would feel to help them out.\n\nExtracurricular activities do influence kids to better themselves, their school, and community. One way was giving these students something to do to improve themselves. Another is making new friends making others lives better helping both school and community. Last is helping others in any way needed for home work, a project, or just by listening. Think of how much better it would feel to help others even if you didn't want to join an extracurricular activity.",

      "My principal, Mr. Generic_Name, has just announced that all students are required to participate in one activity around the school. I think that is is a great idea for Middle and Elementary school! But some of the students don't like the idea as much. I agree with my principal's decision to require at least one extracurricular activity. Whether it's encouraging students to learn something new that they like, getting to know others and making friends, or to spark a new hobby/interest. Here are my reasons and elaboration as to why I think this.\n\nMy first reason is that some of your time in Middle School should be spent doing something that you enjoy learning. The Loudoun Times have written about other schools doing the same change as what Mr. Generic_Name just announced. A writer for the Loudoun Times interviewed students at one school and 1 out of 5 students interviewed didn't like the idea at first, but when the interview happened again in the middle of the school year, that ratio changed to 4 out of 5.\n\nAnother reason why at least one extra curricular activity is good, is that you get to know others and make friends! CBS reported on a camp that was held in the Summer for exactly one week, which had kids aged 11 to 14 from 10am to 7pm, with 23 kids total, and activities of hiking, four square, camping, and more. All of the students except one had reported making at least one friends that they, later on in the camp, gave contact information to. I know this isn't in a school setting, but this proves that students can be the same way when doing a fun activity that they signed up for. If you like Tennis for example, you can play with other people in Tennis that share the same interest.\n\nThe last sentence brings me to my next reason, which is sparking a new hobby/interest. The University of Virginia had 20 8th graders choose something new to learn. The options were, Guitar, Tennis, and Basketball. 16 out of 20 8th graders liked what they chose. The next day, having all of the 20 8th graders either choose something new, or choose something different, 13 out of 20 choose the same option that they chose yesterday. One student when interviewed, said that he liked Guitar and hoped he could learn more about it in the future. That one student probably now has a new interest of Guitar as well as the other students who chose their activity for both of the two days. The people who chose the activity for only one day at least have an idea of what isn't for them.\n\nI have just told you my reasoning! My 3 reasons have now told you why I support Mr. Generic_Name's decision of requiring at least one extracurricular activity. Making friends, getting to know other people, sparking a new interest, and having people choose something that they just want to see if it's for them. At least one of these reasons can help students when choosing their activity and make them feel better. Mr. Generic_Name clearly made the best choice for our school.",

    ESSAY:
      "Did you know schools in your area have decided all students must participate in at least one after school activity? Incredible news if you ask me. Being involved in extracurricular activitys has shown to have amazing results on young growing minds. They're good for your overall health, they improve your skill sets and have a helpful impact on schools.\n\nFirstly, Being required to do a type of interactive activitly are not only expressive and fun but improve you mental and physical health. For example when playing a sport you practice getting stronger, improving your active ability and are getting in shape. You gain muscle and strength throughout your body. Your running gets much cleaner and your breathing gets more controlled. When I was really serious about my dancing skills I noticed a huge build up of leg muscle. Through out the years I've gotten alot stronger in my core and arms. Mentaly being active can take your mind of off hard times in your life. If you had a bad day at school or haven't been feeling your best, being active can make you feel alot more calm and have less anxiety. It takes you to a safe place. Every child should have access to something like that and the fact that not all kids do needs to change. Personally when I get in a fight with my parents I like to go for a run outside or play vollyball with my friends. I always end up feeling happier. Sports can also allow students release any anger or upset feelings they have. Some kids struggle with mentle health issues and don't all have resources to help. Playing a sport or being active can allow you to get ride of the upset feelings in a healthy way that won't harm anyone. I notice this can be a way to cope. It's okay to be angry but it's not okay to take your anger out on others or cause harm. There's also many ways after school activties can improve your different skill sets, here's some examples in the following.\n\nSecondly, extracurricular activitys helps improve your different emotinal skills. You learn to be more dedicated. When you playa sport or apart of a club you're on a team and you need to be there for one another. When you miss a practice you're not only letting yourself down but you're letting your team down too. When someone misses a practice on my dance team it's hard for all of us. We have reblock dances or fill in peeple who arn't there. It's more work for us which is unfair. You also learn to be more motivated. You start to set goals for yourself and strive to achive those goals. It can work with your school and home life too. Motivation can also make you more confident and work harder to be successful. I used to struggle with feeling motivated but when I stared dancing I found a strive for working as hard as I can to get better. It can be stressful but it's worth it. Dedication is also a skill that is getting worked on. Being dedicatied is always doing your best no matter how easy something is. Dedication is found when you try your best and go above what is required. If your apart of a yearbook club you learn to stay dedicated to finish the book and make it look as good as it can. You don't give up when it gets too hard. Your school does alot for you and you should always give back to what you get in return.\n\nLastly, participating in after school activities helps improve you school. When being apart of sports your school provides, that's a way of donating money. You have to pay for things when you're apart of a team ( outfits, games ect). When giving money to your school it helps pay for field trips, better lunches, classroom design and lots more. My old school was able to have amazing field trips because we saved money from donations. Some after school activites can include art clubs, design groups and student council. We could make groups that help clean up trash around the school, let kids get creative and have art work around the school and create new ways students can express themselves and help others. The student council could be in charge of these groups and ensure work was being done. Finally after school groups and activites can help teachers and staff. School's are very dirty and it's a lot of work for only a few staff memebers to have to clean. Cleaning clubs could be a great way students can give back to our school. We could clean the floors, windows and bathrooms. Competive sports teams are a way to get our schools name out there so people pick going to our school rather than any others. If we have good sports teams that win parents will notice that and could end up sending their kids to our school. I have many friends that have moved schools to have better luck in getting into collage through good sports teams at their schools.\n\nIn conclusion, schools requiring all students to endore one after school activity not only shows they care but improves your health, adds to your skill sets and is very helpful for your school and making it a better place. Students may not be as joyful in the begging but will soon notice a huge postive change and outlook towards school everyday. What is your take on this topic ?",

      "Have you ever participated in an activity where you either loved or hated it? Well, believe it or not, I think that all extracurricular activities should be appreciated. Extracurricular activities are activities used to equip you with new skills that you may not have had before, not used to only have fun and learn nothing from it just because your parents forced you to do it. They are there for a reason, and should be taken advantage of. I agree with the decision of the principal for making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity for three reasons: it gives you the opportunity to learn a life lesson, it can improve your academic performance, and gives you a chance to make new friends.\n\nThe opportunity given to you to learn a life lesson can be rare. To learn a life lesson means to realize that this world we live in, isn't fair nor perfect. There will be times where you wish certain things had happened to make life better for you, but that just simply can't happen. Participating in an extracurricular activity can create memories and meaningful experiences that you can't experience anywhere else. It can also help with being disciplined, and can give you something to live for. That is why I think that taking part in an extracurricular activity can be life-changing.\n\nThe act of participating in an extracurricular activity can even improve your academic performance. Depending on the activity, it can motivate students to do better if a certain activity requires you to have good grades in school. Participation in these activities can relieve stress, and looks good on your resume for college applications. Experiences from the activity can be stored up in your brain to be used as background knowledge in the future. Those reasons tie into the fact that taking part in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory.\n\nA chance to make new friends is always exciting for everyone. Making new friends also means making new relationships with the people you care about. Having people that you care for, rather than having random strangers around you, doesn't give you a sense of loneliness. It brightens you up like the sunrise, when you see the first beam of light. Making new friends especially while participating in an extracurricular activity makes it more fun, and amusing. It gives you an electric shock of joy, making you excited to come back again the next time. That is why I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity would be beneficial.\n\nMany people say that students should have a choice whether or not they would like to participate in an extracurricular activity, but I believe that it should be more of the opposite. The opportunity to learn a life lesson, improve your academic performance, and make new friends are the three reasons why I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Therefore, when you meet a student that currently doesn't participate in an extracurricular activity, invite them to join you, or find an activity that you think they would enjoy. This would be a great opportunity for everyone because they would be able to relieve their stress, do something that they love to do, and would enjoy every second of the activity, spending time with the ones they care about the most. Overall, I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of all the benefits, and the giant footprint that it would leave on this planet.",

      "I would disagree I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity and I'll tell you my reason why I disagree.\n\nFirst reason It should be your choice if you want or don't want to participate in extracurricular activity. Somebody shouldn't decide how you make your own choice because you should be able to have the choice to do or not to do extracurricular activity.\n\nSecond reason why you shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activity is because you could be already busy with something else they shouldn't need anymore work or pressure on them. Also this would mean you stay at school longer time because of extracurricular activity.\n\nThird reason it will be harder to get in to the extracurricular activity that you want because since every student have to choose one it will get full much faster then normal. So that mean if you choose something you do like you'll have a unlikely chance of getting it and then get something you don't like.\n\nFourth reason you can't find something that you'll want to choose for a extracurricular activity because you could get bored very easily. It would also be hard to choose if you are also very picky because you don't have many choices to choose from.\n\nFifth and final reason no one can come and get you after your extracurricular activity. A lot of parent have jobs that make them work late and then they don't have time to pick you up and that a problem because extracurricular activity are after school.\n\nSo these are reason why I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity.    ",

      "Should your Principal make you do at least one Extracurricular Activity?\n\nWhen your principal has decided that everyone should do an extracurricular activity, what would you think about that idea? If you want to do an extra activity at school then do things that could make you happy. Maybe try something new and you might be interested, learn more about it. I think that the principal should make kids do extracurricular activities but it should be optional. I will give reasons why the principal should make extracurricular activities optional and not something your forced to do.\n\nPhysical and Mental Strength\n\nIf you want to do an extracurricular activity then you should do one that you will really like and enjoy. Maybe you want to try something new, you can learn a lot from trying something new and you might even like and enjoy it. Maybe your very distracted about something going on at school or at home, you can try something you like and have fun. Doing a sport for your extracurricular activity can help you get stronger and improve your physical strength. You can hangout with your friends and make new ones, it can improve friendships.\n\nTrying New Things\n\nThere are pros and cons to trying new things. What if you don't like your activity or you are struggling to understand? You can ask a friend or an adult to help, you can also try to switch. Some people try new things and they really enjoy it, maybe you tried something new and really enjoyed it. It can be hard to learn something you never new about but it can be fun sometimes.\n\nNo Extracurricular Activities!!!\n\nSome people might not like doing extracurricular activities and that's fine. Many people might have things to do at home or places to go to. It can be useless and you probably know how to do many things. What if kids want to focus on their studies more than their activities? What if kids want to grow up being someone who focuses more in math or English but they have to do activities instead? Like what most parents say, \"Focus on your studies.\"\n\nWhat Would You Do?\n\nAre you interested in doing extracurricular activities? What would you like to do for your activity? Would you like your principal make everyone do at least one activity? Try to do an activity that will help you grow. Maybe something that you and your friends will enjoy so you can have fun while socializing. What would you do?",

      "About 57% of schools students participate in extracurricular activities. This means that over half of every school has students that already participates in an activity. I disagree with this decision because some students do not have time after school, don't have the transportation afterwards, or not interested.\n\nWith this added, where will they find the time for their home life?\n\nFirst, I disagree because some students have a job after school. Some students have to work that job to help support, so having this added would just add to their stressful life. Second, some students have to help their families with things such as chores, make dinner, etc. If they have to stay at school longer, some of those important things wouldn't get done. Third, as we get older we get more homework and harder tests, so it's up to us to keep up with it. After school is the time where the students get to study or do their homework, so when would they do it if they have to stay after school everyday?\n\nNot every student has transportation afterwards, so what do students do when no one can pick them up? First, parents are busy people and have jobs too. Some parents just can't leave work to get their child. Second, if they don't have a ride, they will have to wait with a teacher until someone can pick them up. Thats not fair to the teacher, but to the student too. Third, students would have to bug other busy parents to ask for a ride home. Their friends parents can't always take them home, so on those days how do they get home?\n\nSome students just aren't interested, so why make them do something they don't want to do? First, if they are not interested, they most likely wont be paying attention. If the students not even paying attention, whats the point of even having them there? Second, they would be distracting the people that want to be there. If a student isn't into what they're doing, they are most likely gonna move a lot, make noises, or talk to the people around them. Third, they most likely wont put any effort in what they are doing. No one wants to be around the kid that doesn't do their work, so whats the point in them coming if the aren't going to put in the effort?\n\nIn conclusion, that's why I disagree with the decision. I believe that every student should have the choice of whether they participate or not, due to those factors.",

      "I agree with this 100%. Choosing an Extracurricular Activity is very important. Let me tell you why\n\nExtracurricular Activities can help with Social Skills. For Example if I am suffering from depression it gives me the chance to do something that would take my mind away from the depression. Another reason would be if you have anxiety you can play or choose an activity that relaxes you and just lets you escape from all the anxiety around you. One major point is working better with other people. Extracurricular Activities can help you as a learner work better with others. For Example my Granddad is in the Construction business and when you have jobs like that and teaching and pretty much any job you have to know how to collaborate with other people. This brings me to my final point Extracurricular Activities can help your Social Skills.\n\nThese Activities can help with Social Activity as well. Like for example it give people who might not have friends or the best of friends a chance to make new ones whether it is through Sports or another type of Club. Another reason is because it gives you the opportunity to get closer and create a bond with friends and maybe even family. Plus there are many different clubs to choose from. These activities can help you stay fit and healthy as well. It also gives you the opening to meet new teachers and coaches that you might be able to start a bond with.\n\nThere are many different options to choose from. If you like sports you could play football or basketball or even soccer or baseball. If you like to test your brain power you can join chess or checkers club. And last but not least if you like to speak in front of people public speaking. This is one of my classes that I strongly encourage people to take to help with speaking in the workplace. Art is another option if you like being creative.\n\nSo my conclusion is choosing an Extracurricular Activity is important especially in High School and College.",

They may be locked in their house and can't do anything but school. Also they might be doing nothing just sitting in their house.\n\nEven if they just want to have fun and do something. They can just go to school and do a activity. So then you can have fun with your frenids and do what u love.\n\nIt would be a good help for some people. They may have insety.

It can also be helpful by being a leader, if you want to do sports you can become stronger and more healthier, and the activities you do can also benefit your life in the future, for an example my dad said when he was little he really didnt play sports but when he start liking sports he started to get stronger and so now he gets paid for playing football in the NFL. And to be honest it not all about sports in this reading because other activities like serving in the student council and working on the yearbook can get you to good places academic wise like a good college and a good job.\n\nOne time me and my friends was doing art for an activity and a famous painter came and gave the three of us free passes to take drawing lessons with him, all of us was so excited! See look if we would have never did the activity we would have never got those free lessons and now we might become famous painters/drawers.\n\nThere are a lot of other activities but my favorite activity is cooking because cooking can take you a lot of places in the world and I love to eat. There are about 93% of people that cook in the\n\nWorld and thats a lot of people. You can even use cooking for yourself and others. You can use cooking for yourself by cooking for yourself like how are you going to survive without eating and if you cook for yourself than you can save money by not paying for other food.

They could be playing sports outside of school and can't play on the school team or do other activities outside of school. What time frame would these activities start and end, some students might not be able to make it to those activities. If these activities start early some students might not have enough energy or be to tired to do these activities. Some students might not be able to make it to these activities or be to tired from school and just want to go home.\n\nIf students do not like these activities schools should have more options such as after school clubs, music, art. Students should also suggest ideas that they think is fun and would like to do. Students should have to sign up for these activities only if they know they will do them and have enough energy. The schools should also inform the students parents/guardians that they will be doing this activity.

How would you feel if your principle has made this decision?, and would you agree with this or disagree?. I feel as though, the principle has made the right desicion. People might not agree with this but, all I can do is speak for myself.\n\nWhy, do i agree with such a thing?. I agree with this desicion because, this desicion could do everyone some good. Doing some type of sport or even working on the school news paper could be fun. It would be expecially good for parents. Why? you might ask because, the students won't come home as early, and the parents will have time to run erin's and get some stuff done before their children get home. The parents will also be able to just have more time to their selves.\n\nAlso, this could be helpful to the children mentally and physically. Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television. These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren't up to par to look like \"pretty\" people they can get sad and form some type of depression.\n\nOverall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity's to the students day can help with that. building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you'll atleast know some key factors to living. Building social skills is great too. Lets say you get a job in marketing, you need to be social, have great speech, and be outgoing. In fact, you need social skills for any job. The principle making the desicion to add an extracurricular activity's to students day at school was and great idea.\n\nIn conclusion, adding an extracurricular activity to all of the student body would be an great idea because, it could be benifial to students, parents. and teachers. Building social skills. Life skills, and just being productive has all to do with adding an extracurricular activity to a students day. I think i have stated what my opinion is and what i agree and disagree with. What my opinion is, is that the principle making that desicion is wise and thoughtful.",

      "The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These extracurricular activities include sports, student council, work on the yearbook, and other activities. This will force students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. I disagree with this requirement, for it can be stressful, it forces the students who dislike these activities to participate, and it takes away time for their other responsibilities.\n\nFirst, students might find extracurricular activities stressful. Students who dislike having to work with others are forced into an uncomfortable situation when they are forced to participate in extracurricular activities along with other students. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and some students may not be able to because they have responsibilities at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of homework and other responsibilities at home.\n\nThen, their grades may drop. If a student is required to leave class for their extracurricular activity while doing something important in class like notes then their grade may drop because they missed that work. Students may have work for an extracurricular activity and that work may pile up with work from their other classes. For example, My friend Generic_Name does student council and we were taking notes in class when they made an announcement for all student council members to meet in the library and Generic_Name ended up missing all of the notes for the test the next day.\n\nAlso, students may have other responsibilities at home. Students my have responsibilities at home like walking their dog, cleaning the dishes, doing laundry, and other responsibilities. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and that takes away the time for the responsibilities the have at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of my homework and other responsibilities at home.\n\nHowever, students may enjoy extracurricular activities. Students may choose to participate in extracurricular activities, for it can be a way to have fun, you get to spend time with friends, and it gives you a time away from all of the stressful school work. For example, I do not get to spend time with friends during class because we are working and extracurricular activities can be a way for me to see friends and have fun. That is why some students may choose to participate in these extracurricular activities.\n\nIn conclusion, Students who are forced to participate in after school activities may lose time for school work, responsibilities, and personal time. When a student is forced into an activity that they dislike it they might slack off and that can distract other students who care about their activity from thier work. Students should have a choice of what they do during and after school because it can affect their attitude towards their school work. That is why I disagree with the principal's requirement.",

      "Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.\n\nStudents should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school because it can help you make new friends, help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity, and can improve your skills on specific things. If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people, but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy because most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured.\n\nBeing in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that. Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.\n\nGeneric_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. When he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high school and was really looking forward to it.",

      "I feel as if everybody should be in a club or on a sports team or at least just engaging themselves with something else instead of regular old school. I agree with my principal with making it so students have to participate in a least one extracurricular activity because, everybody needs something to do outside of school. You can join a club and meet new friends and new people, you can find things that you like to do that you never even knew you liked.\n\nEvery kid needs to be doing outside of school, i heavily suggest sports for kids, more importantly a team sport. Being on a team sport teaches you how to be a leader and a team player. At the same time you are getting great exercise that your body needs. Kids need to be kids and having them play sports is a great way to let them go and be kids. You learn a lot of valuable life lessons when you play a sport, some that might stick with you your whole life. Also kids doing something like playing sports or volunteering somewhere can help from get kids off the streets getting involved with drugs and committing crimes.\n\nBesides sports and doing things outside of school, another great way to get into and extracurricular activity is joining a club. Joining a club could be beneficial for someone who has a hard time making new friends. If you join a club you might find yourself interested in something you never even knew that you liked. Say you have a hard time making new friends, if you join a clubs that has to do with something that you really like you are bound to find some new friends because you are surrounding yourself with other people who have the same interests that you do. Also more schools should have more variety of clubs and things to do after school to make school a more enjoyable place.\n\nAnother great thing about participating in extracurricular activities is that you can find new hobbies that you like that you never even heard of or that you've never tried. If your not sure if you should join that club or play that sport just do it, because if you don't and you realize what could've been a good experience is thrown away because you did not want to try anything new. It's okay to step out of your comfort zone every now and then. It may be fun or it may not, you just got to find yourself and what you like, experimenting with things is great for you. Don't second guess yourself, the more you second guess the more your talking yourself out of doing it.\n\nIn conclusion it should be schools jobs to make sure kids are putting themselves in clubs and sports etc. to succeed and have a better life. I highly agree with my principle making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity inside and outside of school, my principle needs a raise.             ",

One reason why Being forced to participate in an extra curricular activity could benefit these kids is because it could make them more have more hobbies and goals. The next reason why making them participate in extracurricular activities would be good for them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and become successful of them. Another reason why forcing them to participate would be good is because It could allow them to develop better social skills and become a better person.\n\nOne reason why forcing them to do activities would benefit them is how they could develop new hobbies and goals. For example, when I started swimming my parents forced me to go to practice even when I did not want to. Now I am a competitive swimmer and enjoy going to practice because I have goals that I want to accomplish. This example shows how making someone participate in something can sometimes benefit them by giving them new hobbies and goals. Another example is when my parents signed me up for the river hawk running program at my school and I did not enjoy running. But now I have made running one of my hobbies and I will try out for my high schools cross country team. This example shows how I was being forced Into running and started out not liking it but now I do. These examples show how being forced into doing something can benefit you by giving you goals and a chance to pursue something.\n\nThe next reason why I think making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and then become successful in them. An example is how my parents forced me to swim and now I will be on TV swimming in Florida at the national level for my age group. This example shows how I was successful and because I was forced to be a swimmer I made it on TV. Another example is how my mom forces me to go to school and I have become a successful student and have been getting all A grades. Another example of how making students participate in an extracurricular activity could make them more successful Is how my brother became a successful piano player. My parents made him start taking Piano lessons and now he has become great at Piano and may try to become are school Piano player. This example shows how my brother became successful by my parents making him start piano. All of these examples show how It would be good for the principle to make the students participate in an activity because it would make them a more successful person.\n\nAnother reason why making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them Is how they could develop better social skills and become a better person. An example of this is when I was in fourth grade and I did not like to talk to people. But when my parents signed me up for a activity after school that would help go around helping people and do food drives I became involved with the program and started to talk to people finding ways to help others. This example shows how I developed better social skills and I became a better person by helping others. Another example of how extracurricular activities help develop my social skills is when I joined my first Triathlon team I had work hard to keep up with my team and cheer for other teammates. This example shows how I was using social skills to cheer for my teammates and why extracurricular activities could benefit students.\n\nI agree with Making students do extracurricular activities. One reason why I think making kids do extracurricular activities would be a good Idea Is because they can develop new hobbies and make goals for themselves to achieve. Another reason why I think they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity is because they could find new activities that they enjoy and become successful in them. And the last reason why they should participate in an extra curricular activity is because they can develop better social skills and become a better person. Overall I think that students should be made to participate in an extracurricular activity because it can make you a better person.",

    ESSAY:
      "Should all students be required to do an extracurricular activity? Yes, I do agree that all students should do some form of activity. There are many types of after school activities that students can participate in, including clubs, sports, debate teams, and so much more. I myself have done so many extracurricular activities. So many I couldn't count them all. I do believe that all students should do a extracurricular activity because, it can improve friendships and social interaction, encourage good exercise and motivation in work, study, and nutrition habits, and make it easier for students with health problems to interact with other kids their age and feel involved.\n\nFriends are very important in our lives. When were kids mostly everyone finds that one person who you can laugh with, make jokes with, have your own secret language, and just be kids! If you ever had that one person, think back to how you met them. Did you just bump into them going down the street and all of a sudden ya'll were best friends? That might be a slight possibility but fighting the odds you most likely met your childhood best friend by doing something that you like to do. Thats right an activity! Children need best friends and whether they try out for the football team or join the debate team, I do believe that you will find a new best friend.\n\nAlthough friends and a very important thing in a stable childhood, exercise and motivation has just as much as a positive or negative consequence on your life. Motivation is a enormous thing that can push you to do anything that you want to do. Joining teams and clubs will not only make you friends but give you peers and trusted adults that will be right behind you for whatever you choose to do. Motivation is also the key to exercise. exercising as a kid will keep you a happy and healthy person for years to come. As the years do come youll find yourself in great habits, keeping yourself healthy. Healthy habits are not the only thing. Its proven that the happier and healthier you are the more you may put into your life. If you just sit on the couch all day not doing anything, your not going anywhere with your life. Good exercise and good motivation are very important things and inheriting those traits just from joining a sport or club, is a huge win.\n\nNow lets talk about the children who are physical and mentally challenged. Yes, they might not have the same mindset as you and me, or can't move some part of their body, but that does not mean that they shouldnt have just as much as a chance as you and me. I think incouringing special education students to enjoy the wonders of childhood are just as important as it was for everyone else in the world. When you involve these children, at that second they won't see that their different, they will see that their with kids their age having fun. Because their kids, they should have equal opportunities as other kids. Let them join that sports team if they are willing to do and and have their mind set on what they want to do. Who is to stop them?\n\nAs more and more children start to do extracurricular activities more and more will follow. So Yes, I do believe that children should be pushed to do extracurricular activities, because if they dont, they might have just given up a huge part of their childhood that they might never get back. As you get older you might still have that best friend still sticking around, or you might still have those study habits and healthy habits, or you might have had been a person that decided to be such a kind person and have that special education kid join your friend group as because you knew everyone needs a friend. No matter what it is, all their is to know is that you gained something so positive that will be stuck with you for decades.   ",

      "I think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. First it could interfear with there scedule, second it could get in the way of school and lastly it could induce stress.\n\nFirst the childs scedule. Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.\n\nSecond it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.\n\nThird is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress. The activites could cause the child to lost sleep and that could leave the child tired and stressed for the rest of there school day. Next it could cause to much stress and that can lead to unwanted sideffects, like hair lost pail coloring of skin, hair loss and suicidal thoughts which isnt good.\n\nThats whyI think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. ",

      "All students must do at least one extracurricular activity. That's what the principal said. I agree with his statement because students are allways stressed about home work,missing work,getting in trouble and friends. An extracurriculer activity is ment for you to have fun and be your self. Lets say your working on the year book and it is a lot of work but the whole school depends on you to do a good job. Now sports sports are a cool way to make friends and have teamwork that way you can acomplish your goal as a team.\n\nEvery student has a life out side of school whether that be waching tv,playing video games,spray painting biuldings or walking dogs. They all have lives but not a single one of them is the exact same. That's why we can get the kids who are good to have fun and the kids who are bad out of trouble. We could make the town a better place one kid at a time. This idea will also help with kids who don't have good grades.\n\nBy not letting them play or commpete if the dont have good grades that lets them work harder to get better grades.\n\nA big part of life is being productive. Being productive is insted of me playing with my phone I help my dad fix a pipe. It's about getting thigs done and being usefull with your time. some kids dont play outside dont talk to their friends the play video games and wach tv. why do that when you could be playing sports,working on year book photos,talking on the debate team and doing there work for school. It's all about getting things done. That is why I think all students should do extracurricular activitys.    ",

      "Have you ever done something you didn't want to do because your parents made you do it? This makes you annoyed at your parents because they just ignored what you wanted to do. It is bad enough that your parents make you do the activity, but what if your principal made you do it. This is why I disagree with our principal making us do extracurricular activities. It is our life, most kids already do extracurricular activity, and some kids don't have time.\n\nIt is our life not the principals. If we want to do activities outside of school it should be our families chose not the principals. Principals job is to be in charge when school is in session, so extracurricular activities happen after school not during school hours. Life is supposed to be enjoyed not suppressed by the principal. We are 8th graders we have a lot of freedom while in school, so why would the school be able to take our freedom away when we aren't in school. We should get to decide our own path not the principal.\n\nMost kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college. They might not want to take on so much debt or they want a job that doesn't require a degree. Extracurricular activities are good for some, but not all.\n\nKids don't always have time. Some kids are put in tough situations whether it is money, gang violence drugs, mom and dad divorce, or foster care. They need their families help to fight through these tough times. If they are staying after school until five and have to ride the bus home it probably won't be until six until they get home. Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home. If the kids got home at normal time they could help clean their own house or make some extra cash for the family. Everybody has tough times, but if they are spent with people who care about them they can go by faster.\n\nI disagree with the principal making us do extracurricular activities. I don't think forcing people to do them is the answer to every bodies problems. Extracurricular activities are helpful for some people but it depends on the situation for what the best way to solve the issue is whether it means seeing a therapist or spending more time with your family. It should be up to the family what is done not our principal.",

The activities you are asking the student to participate in might not be something to enjoy or somrthing they want to do. Also some students may not have the time to do the activity at hand.\n\nAlso if the activity is something physical , the student might have a condition that causes them not to be able to do the activity.\n\nTime is every thing it is something we depend on all the time in our daily lives. Students need time to do the things they have planned as well. Others may have other activites outside of the school activities requested. Some students may want to study rather than do an activity that they know they might not have time for. Some students may have bad grades and want to bring them up and needs that time to do his or her work to bring their grade up. If the time of the activity doesn't fit within the time on which the student is free how will they be able to do the activity?\n\nThe second reason why i don't belive it is important to participate in an activity is because, the student might not any of the activities listed that they would be interested in. Student might want to do this activity simply because of the way the student thinks of the activity. A lot of people are not interseted in doing another acivity because of the are already in or just don't want to do. This also raps around the fact that the student may not have the time to do so and that he or she has enough work or extra things to do regarding themselves. It's the students opinion on what they want to do.\n\nI belive the students should decide on whether or not it's a good choice to have this in place. If the students vote and make a decision they can make a reasonable conclusion that helps every student affected by it. After hearing what the students recomend to the principal, then the principal might not carry on with his decison if it's helpfull or not.

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps with college prep, helps with stress, and doesn't take much time.\n\nWorking on a extracurricular can helps you prepare for college. When you send in your college application they not only look a grades but what you bring to the table. If you play football they might want you for there football team or if you play in band they might want you for there school band. Colleges also give out scholarships for certain activities. If you were good enough at your extracurricular you may even qualify for financial help to pay for college. It shows that you can stick with something and that you are a hard worker and you can keep working even when something is new and difficult. Colleges look at these kinds of things its important to be prepared and accomplished.\n\nTaking a break in the middle of the day and going to a fun class that you choose can really help with stress. It lets you take a break between your academic classes. You some times end up sitting for hours doing math,science, and reading you can become tired and stop focusing. Taking a hour to thirty minutes to stretch, run around, and talk is good for you it can help with your drowsiness and boredom. Taking a break and doing something you love and enjoy could only benefit you. Sports or things like art also improve motor skills and can have a calming affect they can also increase melitonin production in your brain which helps with anxiety and depression. Not only does this mean that it can help with any conditions you may have but also allows personal improvement to take place. Taking time for yourself and picking a class you will enjoy can help you reduce stress.\n\nSome people may say that its a wast of time and you could be doing something academic with that time and that other activities would be more appropriate for the school day. however, there are academical purposes for these activities you could learn a language or take a extra class to get help with math. It is all up to what you want to do with that extra class. Spending six hours of your day sitting and doing work only to get a break to eat is not good for you. If changing that means you waste a half a hour to just run around or talk then so be it.\n\nSome my look at these classes and say they are a waste of time and a distraction from the important classes but the also help in the long run.\n\nStudents need to take a break and join a class they enjoy it will help them with college prep, although them to take a break, and is a good use of there time. There are many benifits to allowing your self time to work on personal goals and make time for yourself\n\nIt doesnt need to be a large amount of time or the most acidemic class it just needs to be a class that you enjoy. ",

Adding the rule that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity would be a fantastic way to make sure that students are getting involved with their school. There are so many choices for everyone in the school. From sports, to crafting, Future Business Leaders, and many more, students are sure to find something that they enjoy. Doing extracurricular activities can help make friends, keep you active, and form a second family away from home. It can also help you later in life with time management skills, and help keep your grades up.\n\nA benefit that comes with joining a team, club, or organization with other people is making friends. It's hard to make friends at school because of constant changing classes and so many people split up. Especially when it comes to sports, you can form a second family. Being on a team, you know that people have your back during a game. After being involved with the same group of people, you start to form a bond that makes everyone so close. Having an outlet with people that you know, and are close to, can really have a positive impact on you're life.\n\nLater on in life, students will remember the work that they put in, and remember the friendships that they made. The habits of time management that come with being a part of multiple things at one time will stick with them. This includes having to wake up early to go to a practice, or meeting. Also being organized and prepared is a big part of the responsibilities that come with joining a group. To be allowed to be in extracurricular activities, you must be a student in good standing. Which means you need to be passing all your classes in order to do anything before of after school.

      "Basketballs get thrown around, paint splashes onto paper and adolescence start to open up their minds to logical thinking. Extracurricular activities should be required in schools because they help students release stress, help thinking in a new way, and makes school enthralling to those who have not been blessed with natural intelligence. Extracurricular activities can improve many students lifestyles.\n\nA long day of tiring work builds up unnecessary stress. Students are packed with homework in subjects they may not enjoy. To end their day with an activity they enjoy can make a horrific day into an enthralling experience; for example, majority of people like spending time with others who they have things in common with. Growing up, it was hard for me to socialize, it felt as if everyone else was functioning faster than Ic was. After a day that felt as if the human population was filled with nothing but sorrow, I finally got to go home and feel the crystal clear water cool my body down, as my team practiced steadily for our swim competition. To have a kid feel relaxed and at peace will improve what they think as they wake up on Monday mornings.\n\nIn the school I have attended for junior high, I am required to take classes that focus on music. In the sixth grade, I chose orchestra because it was an amusing experience to see how one movement in my wrist could cause a pleasant noise to be heard throughout the room. In my science class, we had moved on to the sound unit and i excelled while many other students did not. When my science teacher used words such as octaves, pitch, and harmony it wasn't difficult to understand. The extracurricular activities I have taken have opened my mind into a more creative way of thinking. They taught me that there is more meaning on a paper than what is written in ink.\n\nOne of the many symptoms of depression is memory loss. Since my mother had suffered from the illness, it was genetically passed down to me. Even as a child it was clear to me that school was mainly about memorization. When teachers talked about how we had learned topics in prior years my brain scattered through the many memories in my head but was unable to remember anything. Extracurricular activities aren't about your ability to memorize, but your motivation to excel. That's why it will help students who are more academically challenged would more likely enjoy these activities.\n\nActivities a student enjoys can introduce them to experiences they didn't know were possible. Extracurricular activities help students release stress from the hardships of their day, show them a way to think that they haven't seen before, and is beneficial for those who believe they are not intelligent. I believe that they would be helpful to students and help them excel in the future and should be required in schools.",

      "Do you think every student in you're school should participate in a extracurricular activity? All students should not be forced to do something they don't want to do. This may be good for other students but not everyone has the time for extracurricular activities. Many students have things to do at home and extracurricular could be stopping them from doing them.\n\nExtracurricular activities take time away from students being with their family's, it would also take time away from activities outside of school like a sport they play or something that they participate in. Extracurricular would make students have no time to do there homework or finish any work that they need to do. Many students don't focus on extracurricular and they want to get a good grade. But extracurricular might make them not have much time to study or finish there work. And sometimes students just don't want to do any extracurricular activities.\n\nIf a student does not want to do a activity than they should'ent do it. And if all students have to do extracurricular than it would get to crowded and people will lose more interest in what they like to do as a extracurricular activities. Sometimes students have a hard day at school and they just want to go home and relax. Because they are stressed and don't want to do anything, but if they are forced to a extracurricular activity that they don't like than they will be even more tired and bored. Students need there own free time and choose what they want to do and they don't want to be forced to do something they don't like.\n\nSo in conclusion, students should not be forced to do extracurricular because they have things to do at home and they don't want to be stressed even more. Students go to school to learn, get good grades, so that they can get a good job. Students should be able to use there own free time and not waste it on extracurricular activitys, because they miss time with there family, they could miss out on something really important at home, and they wouldent have time to get to practice if they play a sport, all because of extracurricular that will take up most of there time. Students already have a lot of homework to and regular work to do at home and if there are required to do a extracurricular activity, they will lose a useful amount of time.    ",

      "At first it might seem absurd forcing kids to participate in extracurricular activities, but it would be beneficial for the students now and later in life. This is because the activities can provide students with life long important tools. For the benefit of the students, I believe that kids should be pushed to participate in extracurricular actives. I believe this will benefits the students in a variety of ways that include making new friends, being more productive, and allowing for more success in life.\n\nOne of the main reasons that making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be beneficial to students is the fact those activities allow for new friendships to be created. This is true because most extracurricular activities allow students to talk with each other, and talking with a person is the first step towards friendship. One of the biggest issues facing teenagers is depression, but if they had a place that made them feel comfortable that would help. An extracurricular activity would be perfect to make them feel like they belong. Those friends would also most likely stay with them their entire lives.\n\nA second reason making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be helpful is it could allow them to be more productive. This is because most extracurricular activities are only open for a small amount of time after-school, for anything fun to be accomplished they would have to be productive. Some activities like working on the yearbook, and student council have deadlines, which can teach students how or why to be productive in school. Teaching students about deadlines can also go in their future by preparing them for a college or a job.\n\nThe third main reason that making students participate in extracurricular activities is positive is it allows them to feel successful. It is important for them to feel successful because they will strive to be successful in other aspects of their lives allowing for more success that can also help them in the long term. One being if they join a good club then they can place that on their resume for college, allowing them to get a good job. On the contrary, if they didn't want to or couldn't afford college the club could go right on their resume in order for them to join the work force.\n\nIn conclusion, we should make students participate in extracurricular activities for many reasons, but the three most prominent being it will give them the chance to make friends, teach them about productivity, and will allow for success even after school has ended for them. Extracurricular activities allow for a students to create meaningful lasting friendships. They also allow for students to learn the importance of productivity for the future. The activities teach students how to be successful and why for short term and long term goals.",

      "I think that having to do a after school activity is a great idea. Some might think that they shouldn't but it helps. because it helps in the real world, it helps you be in better shape and it's fun. Those are some reasons, now lets get into deeper detail.\n\nDoing after school activities help in the future, especially if your trying to get a job. They help you with skills you will need to get a job. Like playing on a sports team and the fight to the #1 seed. Helps you because if your trying to get a promotion then you know how it feels to work hard for something that you want. there are also things that can help you get a job like helping take pictures for a yearbook. You could be a photographer.\n\nDoing after school activities also keep you in better shape by keeping you up after school instead of going home and doing nothing. Sports also keep you in good shape by exercises, running and conditioning drills. Also for sports you sometimes have to be fit and well put together so if your not your not making the team.\n\nThey are also fun, because for yearbook on school spirit days you get to be out of class taking pictures for people with school spirit. Also wearing your football jersey on a school day makes you feel like your in a high school football movie. It also feels so good to get on the field and make a play. One of the most fun things in sports if not the most fun thing is a bus ride back after a win.\n\nThose are some reasons why I support his statement on everyone should do after school activities. Because they will help in the future, they help you get in shape and they are fun. those are my reasons hope you like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",

      "Would you like your parents being disapointed in you beacause you didn't do well in your grades? They say your always focusing on school sports, being, council, etc. They think you don't focus on your school work. That might not be the reason, you could be struggling in your studies because of the school activity your told to do. i know my parents would be disapointed in me for having bad grades. I definetly don't support the principles decision of making it a requirement for students to participate in an activity.\n\nSome parents make their kids run errands, doing so may lead them to not be able to participate. They might have younger siblings they have to watch over which makes it hard as well. Students of extra assistance might not be able to do the activities. As the year will go by, studies will get more advanced. Students might get stressed, with the activity on their hands they might get more stressed. I know how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed as a student, things are harder to get done with being pressured. People have different things going on in their lives, it might be hard for them to go to school if there family are not in their llife as much. They could live far away from the school and have no tranportation for school or attending their own game practices.\n\nI think they should require only what is mandatory to pass the current grade students are in. Sport, running for student council, or participating in a school related event should be optional. Some people don't like participating in sports and all these other things, it just might not be their thing. Parents might wanna put their kids in tutoring after school because of their grades, but unfortunatly they can't because they got game practice or school duties. All of these problems caused by the principles decision will lead to students transferring to another school. It might also put a bad name on the school.\n\nThe staff and teachers at the school might be paid a smaller amount of money than their regular pay. If there are no students at the school, the teachers might quit their jobs. The school might shut down, we can't let this happen. If we all work together we can make a big change! We can talk the principle out of this, make students happy, and parents proud again! The parents and students lives wont be so stressful anymore.\n\nFinally, that is why i reject having to participate in an school activity. I want to study stress free and have my life at ease. Students should participate in school activities only if they want to. They shouldn't be forced to if it's not required. I would reccomend the principle to come out with more previleges to help students with their studies intead!",

      "Everybody works when their kids, and when their adults. Kids work so hard in school, and rack up so much homework, it overflows them everyday when they get home. When you have so much work, and so little time to do things you love like spending time with your family the homework gets in the way of that. School takes over your life which is a good thing, and a bad thing. It can be a good thing because you learn so much which can help you excel in life, but it can take the life you should be living when your a kid. A kid should be able to play outside with friends, and go to the pool to swim but they can't.\n\nMaking a kid have to do more school work, and stay longer at school would just give them more stress. More stress would make a kid become overwhelmed, and not do as well as they used to with less stress. Adding a extra activity to a kids life would just take away the name kid, a kid should be with his/her family, or outside running around. Schools need to have extra actives for kids, but they should never force a kid to do them.\n\nDon't make a kid work more and add more stress to their life you should be taking away the stress.\n\nAs a kid to much work just makes a kid not want to work. If you force a kid into adding an extra activity to their seclude it just ruins the childhood they should be having. A kid should make his/her own choices in which what they want to do as a kid. Kids need to have fun, and play around and be close with there family, but adding an activity is like adding a year to a prison sentence, you are stuck in some place you don't want to be at. I believe that all kids should get to chose either if they want to do the extra activities or if they don't. School is just one big heartbreaking place where kids have to sit around all day, and then go eat food which no one knows what it actually is.",

      "Generic_Name was running the fastest that she could, suddenly she cross the final line ; Everyone was screaming from joy. Most teenagers can't participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons.\n\nFor example, in Generic_Name experience was because she had to look after her brothers.\n\nOccasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when\n\nGeneric_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day.\n\nGeneric_Name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream.

For example, before Generic_Name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . Most teenagers don't like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do.

    ESSAY:
      "According to Dr. Maxwell Olchena, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains, participating in marching band can do one of two things depending on your personality, just wait until you see what his studies have proven! I think it's very important to do an extra curricular activity, but I do not believe it should be required, as we just do not have enough options for extra circulars to fit every student's desires. Some extra circulars, such as marching band, are not for the light of heart and truly are scary at points(especially drum line but we'll get into that later.) This is why students should do extra circulars, but it should not be a requirement.\n\nDr. Maxwell Olchena is a psychologist who has been studying the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains for almost 20 years, here's what his studies have shown: there are two things marching band can do to the brain of an adolescent, and however they are affected depends on their personality and nothing to do with IQ(Intelligence quota). Those with higher IQs tend to perform better in marching band, although marching band does not require you perform well(as hard work brings good performance.) The two things that can happen to the brain of an adolescent when they join marching band are, increased mood and productiveness, or decreased mood and productiveness, thats right. Marching band can do two polar opposite things to the adolescent brain. Dr. Olchena's studies have shown that when someone considered an extrovert joins marching band, their mood will decrease and they will become burnt out, this is because they aren't used to the amount of work put into their social life. Marching band is less a sport and more of a social activity, unless you are willing to accept it as your only family, you will not be happy and become very burnt out. Here's where Olchena's studies get crazy, introverts are more likely to have increased moods and increased productiveness when joining marching band. Olchena's studies have also shown that when and introvert joins marching band, they become more social, and those around them report and increase in socializing. Now here's where this relates to every extra curricular, Olchena had his friend, and fellow psychologist, Dr. Alan Russell study this in his area of study, debate team, and the exact opposite is true for this extra curricular. Introverts tend to lose productiveness and have a decrease in happiness, whereas extroverts tend to have increased productiveness and mood.\n\nDrum line, however, is where the studies get interesting. Dr. Brock Hayman, an expert in the effects of drum line on the adolescent brain, has discovered a new area of the brain that awakens the second you join drum line. This area is called the Drumbolow Cortex. When activated, this area of the brain never turns off. The Drumbolow Cortex does some weird things to the brain once activated, it can cause the person to do crazy things, such as picking up gum on the ground of the parking lot at band camp(This has actually happened before.) Other signs that this area has been activated are: inability to stop drumming, addiction to buying drumsticks, need to move up rankings in drumlins, and recruiting more people for the drum line. studies show that 90% of people do not even have this area in their brain, and fewer than 5% of the population has it activated.\n\nThese are all good reasons why you should join an extracurricular(*cough cough drum line cough cough*,) so why shouldn't it be a requirement? Dr. Brett Staudt, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on people's actions around family members, has the answer to your question. \"Those who chose to join marching band will become a disturbance to their family, they will become obsessed with showing their family shows by Drum Corps International, such as the Cavaliers 2011 show in which the drums are upside down. Most of the population does not care whatsoever about how amazingly cool it is to drum upside down, but any person who chooses to join marching band, even if they don't do drum line, will become obsessed with the fact that people have enough skill to play the tenors upside down.\" This quote says two things, you should watch the Cavaliers 2011 show, and also that marching band has negative effects on the life of family members of the person who chooses this curse/blessing of an activity, not to mention, you'll never see that person again because they'll always be at practice or hanging out with their marching band friends.\n\nAlthough I do believe it is a good idea to do an extra curricular, Dr. Nathan Strain has done countless studies on forcing adolescents to partake in things, and it causes them to be less interested in what they're doing. I would rather not have people in marching band who are there only because they've been forced to be there, as they will not work as hard because all they care about is the fact that they have to do it. When students have free will and the ability to make their own decision, they will choose what they feel is best for them self and we should let them do whatever they believe is best for their situation in life at the moment. You never know what else a student has to do at home just to have enough money for food, or to pay for other expenses.\n\nWhat I take away from this evidence is that we should not force students to participate in extra curricular, but rather encourage them to do so. Personally, joining drum line was the best choice(I'm kidding it was a mistake but I'm glad I made it) I've ever made and I will continue doing drum line for the rest of my high school and college career, although had I been forced, I'm not sure if I'd be as happy to be in it. I genuinely think forcing students to do anything will cause burnout and decrease happiness. I truly think students should make their own decision on if an extra curricular fits in their life or not.                ",

    ESSAY:
      "There are many different types of people at school. There are athletes, creative, hard-working, and many others. If they were told that they had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school, I think there would be multiple opinions about it. I think that students should not be forced into doing a school activity for three reasons. Their time, their effort, and their stress.\n\nThe first reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples time/schedule. If someone for example, would choose sports and the sports practices were after after school. If they didn't have the time to practice from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. or couldn't practice form 5:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. then it would be a pretty rough schedule. Another example is when I was playing basketball for my Middle School team. We had practice everyday and it was very tiring. Some people might just want to go home and sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv instead of doing a activity. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of time.\n\nThe second reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples effort. Some people might not like any of the options that the school offers so they might not put all their effort into whatever activity they pick. For example, if a very creative and artistic person looks at all of the options and they are all sport related they will not really care what they pick because that is not what they really like to do. Another example is when my cousins and I went to a arts and crafts place where you could build or draw anything you could imagine. I didn't put as much effort as some as my cousins because arts and crafts is not mt favorite thing to do. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of effort.\n\nLastly, I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of stress. Some people can get stressed out very easily when they have to do something new or there is a lot to do. For example, if someone was taking all of the most advanced classes you could take and then they had to choose something else to worry about could make a lot of stress. They would have a lot because of how much stuff they would have to worry about. Another example is when I was playing basketball and trying to study for 3 tests I had the next day. It was a lot of stress and made me get headaches because I was focused on too much. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of stress.\n\nI disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of three reasons. Their time and how it can make your schedule crazy. Their effort and how much a person likes the options or not. And lastly their stress and how it can make your life have to much to handle.  ",

    ESSAY:
      "If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities can help students with things like building new and helpful experiences, preparing for the future, discovering more about their interests, and socializing with their peers.\n\nJoining a certain group for an extracurricular activity can help you make experiences that can open up different pathways for you in the future. If you ever wanted to pursue a career in a certain field, extracurricular activities that you participate in now can help you prepare for what those might be. For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in a job like graphic design, it could be helpful to join an art club or even yearbook club. When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in. Yearbook club, for example, allows you to design a cover for the school yearbook, which would in turn give you the experience of designing covers. A poll performed by Oxford University has showed that 76% of people who now have jobs in the art field participated in some kind of extracurricular activity at school when they were students to help them learn more about what their future jobs would be like. It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college. Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom. The more activities that you participate in both inside and outside of school, the more qualified you are to go to certain colleges because of your strengths. It helps prepare you for different paths in the future. Participating in extracurricular activities such as clubs and teams can not only help you build experiences for the future, but it can also help you discover what you're passionate about.\n\nIf you decided to join in on an activity that you can participate in as an extracurricular, it might help you discover what you enjoy doing. At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.\n\nParticipating in things like clubs, sports teams, or student council gives students the opportunity to meet new people and branch out. When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others. This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people. Most activities like these use team efforts. For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills. Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers. You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities. The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy. Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are. Teammates have to cooperate with each other and work together in order to accomplish tasks. This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime. This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars .\n\nFor the reasons that I have provided as well as other ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's encouraged that more students participate in extracurricular activities. There are clearly many ways that it would help improve students' lives. It can help them with their passions, socializing with people who share interests or views, and can help students with making new experiences to assist them in the future. Many schools offer a variety of different activities to join that many of the students already find to be enjoyable. Because of the points made, if my principal ever decided that all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with her decision.",

      "Should all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity? Here are some things that might be helpful to get an answer. Some students might have other work to do from school, students may have other activities after school or outside of school, and students might become more stressed from extracurricular activities. Those are some things that might be helpful to answer if students must participate in an extracurricular activity.\n\nFirst, Students might have other work from school that they have to finish at home or after school. Students might have homework, missing work, or late assignments from school that need to be completed on their own time. If students are not able to finish a certain assignment because of an extracurricular activity, it could possibly lower the students grade. If there is an extra class in school, students will most likely have more homework at the end of the day. Students need to finish other work outside of school.\n\nSecond, Students may have other activities after school or outside of school. Some students need to stay after school to retake a test, do late or missing work, or even just get extra help from a teacher. Students also need time outside of school to collect community service hours to graduate from high school. Students may have school or non-school related classes at home that they need to take such as a tutor, church/religion classes, etc. So students may need extra time for after school or non-school related activities.\n\nFinally, students might become more stressed from another extracurricular activity. If some students have low grades, adding an extracurricular activity might overwhelm the student or stress him or her out. If students have a lot of work to complete, they might rush through everything instead of taking their time and being careful. And lastly, students might not be able to keep up with the extra class or work and their parents might keep pushing them on which will again, stress the student out. So students might become more stressed with an extracurricular activity.\n\nSo should students really have to participate in an extracurricular activity? I have come to a conclusion. I disagree because students might have other work from school to do at home, students may have other activities outside of school, and students might become more stressed. Those are the three main reasons why I disagree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity.",

      "I think that this would probably be a good idea. The reason i think this will be a good idea is because the kids have a chance to find there passion if they did not yet already. It may also give the kids a chance to stay active instead of going home and just going on there phones. They can help the school with extra stuff like help making the yearbook. This also can make a student get creative if they want to make there own after school club.\n\nThe reason kids have a chance to find there passion is because of the choices that the schools has. If the kid is athletic then the school must have all the sports as a choice and the kid can choice what he likes and if his first pick isnt his favorite he can just choose another sport until he finds the one he likes. Then once he likes it he can join a actual team and get good at it. Or if the school has a actual team for that sport he can tryout and see if he makes the team. If the student likes art they can go the a art class and either work on there art or try to get better and try new art techniques. If the student is into acting or something like that they can do drama class and act in plays and practice there acting skills.\n\nAnother reason why i think this is good is because it can keep the kids busy instead of them going home to play on there phones. The students can help the teachers with making yearbooks and if they are good enough they can also take some pictures of the clubs. They can help make events or even if they can they can try to make a fundraiser. They can help pass out material to the teachers for there clubs like paper or pencils if they need it. If they do good they can be rewarded because of there good acts.\n\nThird reason why i think this is good is because the kids can get creative. They can get creative by making there own club. And by putting the club together and also thinking of what other they can do to make other kids join. They have to get an idea on how to make the club interesting and how other kids will like it and want to join. They will have to get all the ideas together and make the club that they want to make.\n\nThese are the reasons why i think the principles choice of making a extracurricular activity is a good idea.",

Finally, what if he/she has other things they do at home? For example, they could be playing a sport that is not connected to the school, or they have their own job perhaps. I would not force a student to do any activity at school.\n\nWe should not force students at school to do activities of any kind. If you wanted a student to try a sport or a club, you should try to persuade them to try it out. For example, I'm trying to persuade you that the principal should not force students to do any activity, so the principal should try to persuade the student to try something new. Many students have lots of stress on them, such as homework, things they do at home, and maybe even bullies. Therefore, we should not add more stress to students.

      "What do you think about extracurricular activities? I believe that with amazing extracurricular activities can inspire a student to have a new hobby, or learn more about them self. On the other hand, a bad one can make a student want to quit liking the activity and do something else. My principal decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with making students participate in an extracurricular activity because of time, money, and a negative impact on everyone.\n\nThe first reason is time. Some students might not have enough time to do an extracurricular activity, which could cause the student to have stress. The teacher might lose passion for what they are teaching because of more students, who are being forced to take an extracurricular activity against their will, coming to their after school activity. If the teacher didn't get an influx of students who were forced to take his class, then the they would not have been worn out as fast, or even at all. This will, over time, slowly wear down the teacher, making the class less enjoyable for everyone. Overall, time will be a large problem with forcing students to do extracurricular activities.\n\nThe second reason is money. With more students participating, more supplies need to be bought. There might not be enough money to pay for all of the things students do in an after school activity. The students might not be able to go on trips because they cost to much. People would also be very unhappy if they have to pay for extracurricular activities that their kid was forced into. In the end, there might not be enough money to pay for all of the extracurricular activities.\n\nThe final reason is the negative impact it can have on everyone. The teachers will be very stressed because they have many students who don't care about that activity. The students will also have plenty of tension because they now have to stay at school longer, and manage another activity every day. If the students are stressed, the effect is that their grades will drop. In all, it can cause everyone to have more unneeded tension.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think making students participate in an extracurricular activity is a great idea. It could help students become more social, but it can cause more problems than it solves. It wouldn't be good if the students or teachers were unhappy because of the principal making students participate in after school activities. I believe extracurricular activities are used to show students new activities and have fun.",

      "Extracurricular Activities Shouldn't Be Forced\n\nHave you ever been forced to do something you didnt want to do? Did you do the task happily? Most people would say it was not an enjoyable experience. When talking about the topic of extracurricular activities in schools, it is definitely something that shouldn't be mandatory. These things shouldn't be forced because it will result in unhappy and resentful students. Also, students should be able to choose their hobbies, and it is frankly none of the school's business.\n\nIf we force students to participate in a list of activities that may not cater to their interests, it is only going to make unhappy students who don't actually put any effort into the thing they are being forced to do. Again, try and think back to a time when you were made to do something you didnt want to do. Something that took time away from things you actually wanted, or even needed to do. You probably didn't do that thing with a whole lot of thought and effort, or at least you didn't do it in a good mood. What's the point of forcing kids to do activities, if they are just going to do it sloppily, with zero effort. No matter how many options a school provides, there will always be kids who don't like any of them.\n\nEven though they may not like any of the options at school, whose to say they don't enjoy something outside of school. For example, what if a student is really passionate about their art? And between their chores and school work, they only get work on it about an hour of their day. Now, because they are forced to play a sport or join a club, they have absolutely no time to work on what brings them joy. This defeats the whole purpose of an extracurricular activity.\n\nEven if everyone was perfectly happy with the activity they have to do, why is it any of the schools business what people do with their free time? A school's job is to give students a safe place to learn, and to provide optional extracurricular activities. It's not a schools job to control so much of a students life, that it's even taking up time outside of school. Schools have no idea what goes on in a student's life, and it is unfair for them to assume everyone just has the time and want to do an additional thing outside of school. If a student wants to participate in something, they will. There is no need to force people to do things they dont want to do.\n\nAs you can see, the idea of making an extracurricular activity mandatory has many downsides. So many that it is obviously it is not a good idea. Making people do things they don't want to do has never turned out good. Students need the freedom to make their own choices, and the school should have nothing to do with that. No matter how many benefits, extracurricular activities should never be mandatory. ",

      "Even though a lot of school aged kids participate in after school activities, there are still a lot who don't. Some of them don't participate because theres nothing they like. There are also some kids that act like since they arent forced to do the activities then they won't ever do them, which may set them back in life. Most activities can be so fun, exciting, and interesting. In addition, there are a lot of benefits to participating in such activities, they keep you active and healthy, makes interact with others, and they can keep you busy. So if the principal was to make kids participate in one after school activity that would be a great and wonderful idea.\n\nPeople who commit to an activity of some sort can stay active and have a healthier mindset compared to a person who doesnt participate. For example, if you sign up for volleyball club after school after the principal made the announcement that you have too. You now not only have a way to exercise but also an activity to help take your mind off everything else. Even if you sign up for a learning club or activity, like a \"teaching you how to eat healthy club\", can impact your life. But you can get healthier after participating in a club or activity. If your going through a rough time then for some people a good thing would for you to do something other than mope around about it. You can develop good sportsmanship and other great qualities of a person. In other words many good influences can come off of having to do an activity.\n\nInteraction with other people is almost a given when participating in any sort of activity. Human interaction is a huge part of everything in our world. But so many people today have a hard time with it for many different reasons. So if you start at a younger age, trying to get better to interact with people, you'll get set for the rest of your life. As you interact and talk to people you learn a lot. You develop a sense of great team work and friendship. So many friendships are started when you start talking to people at these actives. You'll feel not alone and a great friend can rub off some good traits, making you a better person. In conclusion, interaction is great to do and going to these activities will help you interact with people.\n\nActivities make you stay busy, and take up your time in a good way. People who don't participate in activities will get bored easily and often. While someone who does participate in one will have a lot more to do. For example, if you participate in a spring lacrosse league and on a random Sunday you get bored you can practice lacrosse in your backyard. Another example might be if you participate in boy scouts or girl scouts you may have homework to do before your next meeting. But all a person has that doesn't participate in any activities is sitting on their bed or a couch on their phones. Then every hour theyll think to themselves how bored they are. Participating in activities gets you busy and not as bored as often.\n\nMaking kids participate in any activity, or sport is a great idea. Why? Well because great benefits come from participating in activities like keeping you active, interacting with others, and keeping you busy. Whatever you do whether its a club, sport, or just a plain activity of some sort, many opportunities can show up for you. A new passion developed can introduce a job oppritunity or hobby. Doing activities is a wonderful experience that you have to do yourself. Even if you might not completely like what youre doing at first. Who knows maybe you'll find your new passion and hobby.       ",

      "Did you know 68% of the students spend an estimated 4 hours on their phone every single day? Have your parent force you to get involve in a activity at school that you don't like? Does your parent ever said, \"You play on your phone 24/7!\" Students should get involve in at least one extracurricular activity at school because students can makes new friends, they get to experience new things that they never done before, and help students express them self to others. Students can choose up to 25 different activities to do after school like sports, art, clean the school, and a lots more different activities. This help students get involve with their school.\n\nWhen students is participating the extracurricular activities, they can make new friends. When making new friends, they are introducing them self to other students. This can improves their communication and social skills with other, good communication can also help students when they are in school or in the outside world. Additionally, they also get to a better understanding of the other students personality. For example, a student can shared their past experience with another student, discuss what they have in common, their goals, and about their friends and family.\n\nThe students get to experience new thing that they never done before. They get to find out what they enjoy, and get to know a little bit of them self. Students can express them self through activities like art, sports, and music etc. Students get to learn new skills throughout the variety of activities, and later students can shared their skills that they have learned to other students or family member. Students also get to learn about different career, subject, languages, and etc. Later, it can help them in life when they are adult.\n\nIt can help students get involve with activities. Back when there is no electronic, every kid play outside, and not a single kid hated going outside. Children were energetic, they love outdoor activities and playing with friends. Today generation is different, 10 years old boy playing video games all day, and children spending 4 hours everyday playing on their phone. If we have extracurricular activities at school, then more students would get involve in activities. Parent can also get involve by supporting their children.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many benefit when it comes to getting students involve in an extracurricular activities. Students can make new friends, they get to experience new thing, and get to express them self through the activities. Some may say if every students have to get involve in an extracurricular activities. Then, it just going to limit the time that the students get to spend with their family.

      "Imagine this, you've had a long day as a student waking up early and working hard to do well in school all day, but then you remember you have Basketball practice tonight! This excites because you have become close friends with your teammates, and it serves as a nice break from everything going on in school. Attending after school clubs and activities can give you a place where people with similar interests and hobbies all come together. After school clubs can be a safe space where you and your friends get together to do something you all enjoy, and you could make new friends along the way. Being in a club can provide a safe space, and the people there often share your interests. Activities like these can make you an all rounded person while also giving you a break from school.\n\nActivities from football to Rubiks cube club can create a safe space for the people on the team or in the club. What do I mean by \"safe space?\"\n\nA safe space is where people can share how they feel, and why they feel that way. An example could be if you're on a football team your teammates become your friends and that gives you a whole community of people who care about you. It doesn't even have to be a team it could even be a group that likes horses, but they still have something in common to bond over. Teammates also tend to build you up, and give a boost in confidence which can help you be a stronger person. Did you know that having fun with your friends and participating in the activities you enjoy can even help you get into college?\n\nI think that having students participate in an extracurricular activities could very beneficial for many different aspects of their development, such as social, emotional, and in some cases even physical. Most students are very focused on their academics and doing well to look good for college. What they might not know is colleges don't only look at grades they also look at your extracurricular s. Looking at what you did after school as well as in school helps hem see that you are able to juggle both things at once, but what they don't know is we actually enjoy it! Though it might seem like a lot especially with all of our school work, it could serve as the well deserved break we need.\n\nStudents have a lot on their plates between school, homework, and studying, sometimes it's good to take a break. What better way to relax then do something you enjoy with other people that enjoy it as well. Playing a sport after school can help you create close friends and teammates. When you think about stress reliving one of things you might think of is one of your favorite things to do with some of your friends. Well guess what, you just explained what a club is. In that portion of your day you don't have to worry about acing that test all you have to think about is swishing that three or winning that chess match.\n\nAs a whole I think that after school activities could be beneficial to students in many ways. Many students might not fit in to friend groups, but with after school clubs they know they have similarities with their peers. It's a great way to relive stress with the people you care about while doing something you care about. That's why I think that having everyone participate in a club or sport could be very beneficial for these reasons, and I think it's a great addition to our school systems.  ",

Because it relieves stress and make students look forward to school, can also be good for the school, and help student figure out what they want to do after they are done with school.\n\nI think that these school activities are good because the student can use these activities as a way to relieve stress by reading. These groups can also include counseling if the student has any problems outside or inside of school. lastly students can use these activities to learn about what they and other student want to learn, for example if the student wanted to learn photography he/she would be allowed to take pictures of flowers or animals. This is why I believe that students can relieve stress from school or from family.\n\nAnother that we should allow these activities is that they not only benefit the students but can also benefit the school.\n\nthis is because the student can make a club that every week they pick a random teacher and show her/him appreciation for helping us learn. Another thing a students can do is create posters for the school sports team. And they could help put together a school yearbook. This is how these activities will also help the school out.\n\nlastly I think that this could be very helpful for the student and allow them to explore what they want to do.

Taking care of a younger sibling, cleaning the house, helping their parents out, etc... but on the other hand if students are going home to play video games,not interacting with other people in the outside world then they should,because they can't be inside all day they need some fresh air and interact with other human beings.\n\nBut heres the thing students already have school for about 7-8 hours half of the time either listening to the teacher or taking a test so obviously they leave school tried and exhausted.\n\nMany students don't even like coming to school and still show up I think if the principal forced students to join a extracurricular activity the percentage of students skipping will increase and students might not even show up to school.\n\nWe also have to think about the teachers ,you are obviously going to need a teacher to stay with the student for whatever curricular activity they get assigned to but believe it or not teachers have a life outside of school.

Like if you did soccer you could get better with your running skills. Also if you did basketball you can use your body more witch causes you to get strong. If you do play a sport and your stress you can let it go when you play like you can shoot the basketball or you can kick the soccer ball. You also make new friends that become like a family.\n\nStudent council is fun you get to do lots of stuff with your school. Like you can make posters and hang them around your school that say ice cream social in one day. You can also make a poster about you running to be school president. If you get voted to be president you have to go to SCA meetings were you plan events to happen for the school and more.\n\nThe school yearbook is cool. Because you can take pictures of the school and students. You get to design the year book and the cover for the book. You can also take funny pictures of your friends and put them on the yearbook. It also can be a awesome memory when you get older.\n\nThats why I agree with the principal. Its a great way to make new friends and to let out stress so you can have a good time and enjoy the rest of your school year.",

It could be fun and students also can make more friends.

      "Ever been rushed around? Have had so much to do in so little time? What if you had to do a extra activity on top of that? Would your life be hectic? I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activity For example, time is something that passes all the time. Not all of the students can get a ride, adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. In all, adding extracurricular actives is a bad idea.\n\nTime. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle. Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air.\n\nbuses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figure out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride.\n\nSols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed. Making kids do something that that they don't have time to do creates a lot of stress. Students should be able to chose what they want to do. If they can handle doing extracurricular activates then they can, it shouldn't be a must. Making kids do something that isn't needed will drag them down making them now want to come to school. School should be a place of safety were kids can chose what they need to succeed in life.\n\nMaking kids do extra activities will make students have less time for home, not all kids can get a ride home from school, doing this will ad more stress. Do you have enough time?             ",

      "I think that forcing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity would cause stress in many different ways. Students already have a lot of school work to do and making them do this would be difficult. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a care provider for the family, or might have a job to do. This could also result in a lack of effort in certain things at school and at home.\n\nIf students have a lot of school work to do they could become stressed from not being able to get the work done. Students also might need to study and would not have time to do that, therefore, causing them to get a bad grade on it. This could also result in a bad grade on their report card, maybe even causing them to fail the class. If the students fail the class they will have to retake the class the next year, and if the students were already struggling with the class they would have to do it all over again causing stress in that way to. To much stress causes anxiety which can be harmful to the students self confidence, could make them sad or depressed, and many other problems.\n\nStudents might be a main provider for their family, taking care of family members, and paying for stuff the family needs. They might also be paying the bills or buying food and clothes for their family members. If students can't provide for their family they could become homeless or become sick. Might become in debt from not having someone work and make money for the family.\n\nStudents might also have a job to do and would not be able to work because they would not have time to work after school. They might also have a job so they can provide for their family or themselves. They might need the job to save up for college and schooling. If the students don't have the time to go to work they might get fired and they would not be making money to provide for family or themselves.\n\nSo in my opinion, I don't think this would be beneficial in any way to the students. This would be very stressful for the students and could also cause anxiety, even making the student become depressed if it is to stressful for them. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a main care provider for their family, and might have a job to do so they can pay for the stuff that they need to live a descent life and not be stressed. That is why I disagree with this decision.",

    ESSAY:
      "The principal at my school decided that all students need to take an extracurricular activity. How should I, as a student, feel about this? Do I agree with their decision? What is an extracurricular activity, and why did my principal make this decision? Figuring out the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, and how they impactthe students, will help me conclude how I feel about this choice.\n\nWhat are extracurricular activities? These activities are something a student could participate in to entertain or captivate them. Examples of these activities could be an art class, sports, or even a chess club. Normally, these activities are something you personally enjoy, or have a passion for. They could be in school, after school, or maybe not in school at all. One way how most schools get you to take an extracurricular activity, is by offering electives. Most schools have electives as a fun class for students, or something they enjoy learning. Another reason schools might have electives, is for the mind to grow, and find fun in certain activities. Not everyone has the same passion, so there are many options. You don't necessarily need to be good at an extracurricular activity, you just have to love, or have fun doing it.\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind the principal forcing the students to take at least one activity? Cellphones are one of the main entertainment for teenagers, them often spending many hours a day on them. Even if you enjoy using your device, it is not the type of passion most adults would choose. Making students do an extracurricular activity might positively give them a push to try new things. Taking an in or out of school activity may expand the students outlook on electives or clubs the school offers, and alluding for them to try something new. Going to these clubs or activities, offers new friendships as well. Other people that take the same activity as you, may also share the same passion. It is easier to connect with people who are similar to you. The principal would want the best for their school, and by making the students take an activity, they get new educational experiences.\n\nEven though these activities can have a positive effect on the students, there can also be negatives. Some students don't care about finding a passion, or an activity for them to do. They might just want to take a class that gives them an \"easy a\", not because it's something they would actually do for fun. Not only that, but some students just try to get into a class with their friend. That friend might be taking a class that doesn't interest the student. Taking a subject or activity that is boring or uninteresting to you, won't help you find what you like to do. When forcing the students to take an activity, while it might help them find their interests and explore new things, it might also force them to do unwanted subjects that don't please them.\n\nIn conclusion to this prompt, I agree with the decision of the principal to make all students take an extracurricular activity. Forcing the students to take an extracurricular activity, can effect them greatly. It offers them experiences, finding what they like to do best, and discovering what they are good at. It can expand their communication with other people, and overall, make new friends. These activities, depending on what they are, can be good for your health. Some students don't particularly care about finding what they like to do, and would rather just be with their friends or use their cellular device. Making these students take an extracurricular activity, can make them discover new things that they didn't know or realize before.",

    ESSAY:
      "Have you ever tried an in-school sport or club? Many students enjoy extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. But some students aren't as keen on the idea. Some think it's a waste of time, or that they're very boring. But extracurricular activities help students and schools in many different ways. I think students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity because the students will learn new skills, students will become more social, and the school will become more diverse in it's interests.\n\nThere are many skills to be learned in extracurricular activities. Depending on what activity it is, you can be taught a wide variety of talents. After school sports will teach you the basics to the game, and then maybe you'll make it to the school team for that sport. Certain clubs will teach students other games and talents. At my old school, there was a huge chess club. Some of the kids that went to it every Wednesday didn't even know how to play at first. Then they learned, as any other student could if they attended a mandatory extracurricular activity. Some clubs can even teach students the basics of just being a good student or friend, like the homework club, or the diversity club. So if every student took a mandatory extracurricular activity, everyone would learn a lot.\n\nStudents can become more social through extracurricular activities. The more students spend time with people with similar interests, the more friends they'll make. If a student was to only hangout with the same group of friends all year, he or she would never become more social, which is a good skill to have as you get older. Besides, a student might make a life long friend through an extracurricular activity. Even if a student doesn't make any new friends through extracurricular activities, they'll still have learned important communication and social skills.\n\nIf a school has a large variety of extracurricular activities that every student is attending at least one, the school will become more diverse in the student's intersests. Diversity in a school is very important for many reasons. Diversity would look good on how the rest of the county views the school. Then they might follow suite and make extracurricular activities mandatory. Another reason why diversity in a school is important because the students will impact each other and make each other want to try more activities, making a postitive cycle in which students want to partcipate in extracurricular activities, therefore benefiting them in the other ways, social and skill benefits.\n\nIn all, mandatory extracurricular activities will help our school system in plenty of ways. They'll teach students skills, make students more social, and make the school more diverse. These are just some of the reasons that schools need mandatory extracurricular activities. If you want madatory extracurricular activities at your school, start a petitionfor your principal to see. Even if that doesn't work, you can always just convince your friends and classmates to go to these extracurricular activities. This is why I believe schools should have mandatory extracurricular activities.",

      "Have you ever wondered about the benefits of students participating in an activity? Extracurricular activities can have many things to it. Some activities can be sports,yearbook designing,student council, and many other things that students can enjoy. Students would have a great time and enjoy these types of things and can find different kinds of activities they could participate in. All students should participate in an activity because it can help students find an interest,students can enjoy it, and can help keep their minds distracted from school.\n\nStudents can find different activities to find an interest/hobby. Students who don't usually participate in activities or events can find something new if they are being told to do something. Hence, making a student find an activity means that they will be searching to find one, and will lead to finding an activity they find interesting and try it out. In other words, students who doodle once in a while might find an art related activity and join. In addition, this can also help them keep an open mind and not think that all or some activities are boring or considering them as something they would never like doing. Some students might also be shy or not be involved to much in things so they might want to join an activity but are to scared to participate. This means that when students must pick an activity they can feel relieved and happy to do so.\n\nSome students can enjoy having extracurricular activities. For example, student would enjoy having activities because they can be able to do something that they enjoy instead of having class. To add to this, students that are athletic wouldn't be able to play a sport during class because it isn't allowed and would be very disruptive. Therefore, when students are allowed to choose an activity that would make them joyful and excited to join the one they connect with the most. This will also be beneficial to the class/classes that a person is in because they have already done what they wanted during their activity and it can help them focus in their classes more efficiently.\n\nThe minds of students can be distracted from school related things. Students nowadays can become stressed, and can cause their brain to be less efficient. Students can be feeling down and even depressed which is a very bad situation for students since they have lots of things piled on them. Some of these things would include projects,homework, essays, and other things that can be personal to that student. Therefore, by joining an activity students can relieve their mind off certain topics and think about other things. While in an extracurricular activity they can communicate with others and can find new friends too. In addition, they can also find an activity that can help them relax and be more calm. For example, a meditation club (activity) would be very helpful or an art activity so they can draw out their emotion/feelings.\n\nOverall, students should all participate in activities. This is because it can be appealing to some students and not so appealing to others, but this can make them find different activities/opportunities and keep them open minded. Students can also find new friendships and can be distracted from school related things which keeps their minds functioning. Extracurricular activities include lots of different things and students can enjoy it and consider participating in one or more activities. Students should all join an activity because it helps them clear their minds,some students enjoy activities, and it can help students find an interest/hobby.       ",

      "A tiresome day of school just ended, but instead of being exhausted, you are exited because your extracurricular activity is about to start. Many students go to school everyday, then leave on the bus, or walk home, until returning the next day. Because a lot of students do that, the majority of them never experience any clubs that the schools works hard to put together. By making students try out a club, they would appreciate what the school has to offer. Principals should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help students be active in the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students explore some of their interests for the future.\n\nOne reason that a school's principal should require students to have to participate in at least one activity after school is so that students become active in the school once the hours of school are done. Students who stay after school for an extracurricular activity participate in some of the schools programs. This leaves a stronger connection from the students to the school. Students can choose out of many clubs offered, and therefore feel as if they found a bigger reason to stay in school. A reason that students should be required to participate in an after school activity is so they are more active in the school.\n\nAnother reason that school principal should make kids participate in an after school club is so that kids can interact better with others. When students join a club in school, they meet new kids, ones with similar interests as them. Because of their shared interests, students can form a bond, all because of this club. Kids would also talk with the teachers running each club activity because they have more in common, like a passion for the club. A second reason that kids should have to participate in a extracurricular activity at school is so they learn to interact better with both students and teachers.\n\nLastly, if a school principal made students join an after school club, students would find and explore some of their interests. Students all have their own interests and hobbies, but to find them, one would have to look. Middle and high school students are at the perfect age to explore passions because they are getting ready to pick a major in college, so they are looking high and low for an idea of what their major will be. By joining a club at your school, students will find some club that pulls at them, inviting them to join. Also, students would have time after school to try new clubs or sports. For example, an interested student could choose to participate in the yearbook committee, or even the SCA. One last reason that students should participate in an after school club is because they can figure out some of their hobbies and passions before college.\n\nIn Conclusion, if a school principal required that all students must participate in some after school club, students would become more active around the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students expand their hobbies. A student would have a bigger purpose to stay at school if they had to join a club, giving them a stronger connection to the school. The interactions between students and teachers would be higher because they would have more in common. Finally, students would explore many different career paths for college and have a varied set of interests when participating in after school clubs. Principals, by making your students participate in an extracurricular activity, you help students in a lot of ways, so consider trying out this idea for a better future for your students. ",

      "Regarding the decision the Principal made, (\"all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity\")\n\nI agree with for the following reasons.\n\nThe first reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will improve social life for many students at our school.\n\nSocial Life is very important for kids my age because, it helps build character, (which means, it builds up personality and special traits within a certain student) creates new friendships, (always a good thing to have) and it will also make the student feel like they're a part of something.\n\nAnother reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will also help students who are dealing with personal stress. As everyone knows, a lot of kids my age suffer from different types of stress. Which are mostly caused by either depression, anxiety or even loneliness. Which means that with this new opportunity they have, their depression, anxiety, and loneliness might go down a bit as they get to interact with other students while they participate in activities they might of never even tried before.\n\nThe final reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will even help students develop time management skills. Most students at our school (that I know of) either don't have time or don't know how to fit everyday activities like school, homework, and free time in their everyday lives. So, since they have to participate in something new now, it might open up their eyes a bit and help them see how to distribute their time, which will result in them having some free time at the end of the day.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the Principal's decision to make students attend or take an extracurricular activity is a great idea because, it improves social life, lowers stress some students might have, and also helps students develop time management skills.",

      "Students should not have to participate in activities because some students might not have any interests in the activities the school provides them with. Teachers, and parents always tell me \"school comes first\", but the principal is more worried if a student makes practice on time. Now cm not saying activities are bad for students, but why does every student have to participate when they should be more worried about their future. Kids are more worried about missing their clubs than missing the notes that the teacher is providing before the test. Students should not participate in activities because some kids might not have any interests, kids should be more worried about their education than their clubs, and last but not least, kids are missing missing the notes that the teachers provide for the kids so they can pass their test.\n\nNot only does this situation affects students, but it also affects teachers and parents. Most teacher are anxious for kids because they have doubt that the students will not pass their assignments or even their class. Parents are terrified of the school calling them because their kid is not passing. Getting an education should be a kid's top priority because not one dream will be possible without an education. This situation can affect teachers and parents because they both get anxious when their kids are not passing a class, A kid's top priority should be getting an education.\n\nSchool activities are good when students are still doing good in school. activities should not be in front of education but kids will put it there when teachers are forcing students to take an extracurricular course. Most students only want to learn when they walk into school. But they are being forced to join an activity that has no relevancy. School activities are good when kids are passing, a kids education should always be first, being forced to join an activity is not right.\n\nWhen I was 13 years old in seventh grade, I was on a basketball team. When I walked into practice my coach called me in to talk about my grades and why I was failing, he didn't care about what I had to say so he cut me from the team. When I walked home my anxiety level went through the roof because I was trying to find a way to bring up my grades before the school year ends. When I told my parents what happened they started panicking and hitting and told me it was way too late to bring my grades up and I might fail. My body felt cold and I was depressed, I begged my teachers for help everyday but they told me that it still would not bring all of my grades up. Because I didn't care about my school work I had bad grades, I had anxiety, and last knowing I couldn't do nothing to bring my grades up gave me depression.\n\nStudents should not have to participate in school activities because most kids might not have interests in them. activities can affect a kids grades which can have teachers and parents worried. Kids will put their activity as their top priority when getting their education should be. Students, and the school staff should be more productive with students education. Activities are not a bad idea but forcing kids to join a extracurricular course is not right because that is not what school is about.",

You can learn to play basket ball. You can learn new subjects. You can read books and know learn interesting facts about animals. And you can learn to play a clarinet.\n\nNext, you make new friends and collaborate with different people you never knew. You can talk to young or older kids. You can ask questions to know someone better. You can hangout with new people to see what you both like to do. And you can do the same activities together .\n\nFinally, You can give your mind a break from thinking a lot by going out for a run. Walking outside in the sun. Sitting in the dark relaxing. Doing some yoga with your friends to ease your mind. And you can ride your bike outside.\n\nIn conclusion if you want to have a break, ease your mind, and relax just do and extracurricular activity and you can learn new things about food or animals, make new friends with anyone you'd like to know, and give your mind a break and do some extracurricular activity.  ",

    ESSAY:
      "Neville Longbottem transformed from a blundering idiot to the hero who destroyed Voldemort's most precious Horcurx. How did he do this? Through extracurriculars, which are also extremely important for students in the real world. I agree with my principal that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities encourage students to become more confident and brings to light their hidden qualities, while also giving them skills that will be useful throughout their whole life. Students can also discover their passion through extracurriculars, which could eventually become their life's work.\n\nExtracurricular activities instills confidence in a person and helps them show others their best qualities. If we dig deep into Neville Longbottom's school life, we discover that everything changed after he joined Dumbledore's Army, a club founded by Harry Potter to encourage the learning of Defense Against the Dark Arts. He gained confidence while he took over the club for Harry, and his true qualities of bravery and courage really shined through. Confidence is important because studies have proven that a person who is clearly confident is more respected by their peers. Possessing confidence helps a person to have good mental health as well and boosts up happiness levels by at least 80%. It is also important for a person to show others who they truly are, because hiding their true qualities creates feelings of dissatisfaction, which is overall detrimental towards a person's happiness. Helping students open up and gain confidence are just one of the several benefits that extracurriculars provide.\n\nStudents gain necessary life skills as well as confidence through extracurriculars. These life skills are often skills that can only be acquired through experience. Social skills such as leadership can definitely be acquired, and it is a coveted skill that can eventually lead to success. Just look at Neville! Proof that leaders are made, not born. Students also learn the importance of commitment as well as the skill of cooperation through extracurriculars like sports. In Quidditch, a sport that requires a ton of commitment and cooperation, Harry Potter learned to drag himself out of bed at the crack of dawn and deal with foul opponents, something which would definitely help him later on in life after he became the Head of the Auror Office. One of the most important skills a person can learn while doing an extracurricular is time management. Most self-made billionaires are masters of time management. Balancing extracurriculars with school is no simple feat, and will definitely prove to be useful in the future.\n\nOne of the best things about extracurriculars is that it will help a person find that passion which will fuel their life's work. By exploring different clubs and activities, a person can discover what it is that truly ignites fire in their soul. In a recent poll, 87% of the people who have a passion state that they are at least 95% happy about where their life is going. These are incredible numbers compared to the 97% of people who don't have a passion who state that they are less than 30% happy about where their life is going. Another poll has stated that less than an estimated 50% of people do not enjoy going to work. This is because they are not passionate about it. A person who hates their work will not be happy at all, which could result in early health complications. For students in particular, finding a passion is important because colleges are more favorable upon students who have a passion versus those who don't. Having a passion is necessary for happiness, and extracurriculars will help students find their passion.\n\nI strongly believe that extracurriculars are necessary. They help students gain confidence and a passion and teaches important life skills. Most importantly, they make students happy. Neville Longbottom, the former laughingstock of Hogwarts, transformed himself through an extracurricular. Even though Neville is fictional, he proves the importance of extracurriculars, and shows exactly why every student should participate in at least one. ",

      "Whether it's a lovable hobby of yours or an aspiration, there is always a task a person loves to carry out.\n\nMandatory extracurricular activities would be a phenomenal addition to the requirements of our school.\n\nI find this decision to be fantastic because it gives the opportunity to students to practice unknown activities and find new passions that drive them forward.\n\nIn addition, the school too would benefit from the growing skills and work put out by the students through extracurricular activities.\n\nThe first reason why I agree with our school in this decision, is because it will provide the opportunity for both me and my classmates to practice the unknown and find new passions for us to follow.\n\nThis practicing of new activities will provide us students a development in our skills.\n\nFor instance, if I were to become the head of the student council I would experience how to become a leader, the skills needed to be a leader, and how to drive my classmates to become better students.\n\nSecondly, a new drive or passion for our motivation could become discovered through the practicing of extracurricular activities.\n\nAs a result of this finding of new passion or drive, both me and my classmates would be able to figure out what it is we really aspire to be in the future to come.\n\nFinally, the experience that would be provided to us through extracurricular activities, be it sports, leadership roles, or other extracurricular activities that are available to us, would be extremely helpful in our futures.\n\nSpecifically, the work ethics that would be highly important in our future in college and even when having a job, these work ethics would be taught like wildfire in any extracurricular activity as long as participation and active engagement is exercised.\n\nThe growing passion and drive combined with the learning of skills and work ethics will surely benefit both me and my schoolmates in the future to come.\n\nAs for the second reason I support my school's decision, it is due to the fact that my classmates will not be the only to gain through the mandatory extracurricular activities rule, the growing skills along with the hard work that will be progressively demonstrated by the students will surely benefit the school in more ways than one.\n\nA major part of any school, the yearbook, could be made and designed by the people who are inside of the yearbook.\n\nSpecifically, the feelings, emotions and bonds created and felt throughout the year by myself and by my schoolmates, could only be expressed inside a yearbook through the people who made those bonds and felt those feelings.\n\nHowever, that is not the only benefit, the students of the school will also be able to make a more deep and connecting bond through both the teachers and through each other.\n\nFor instance, not every club or sports team can run by a teacher or by a student, this diverse teaching environment that will be provided will prove to show a deeper connection through my schoolmates and through their main learning environment.\n\nLastly, the improvement of attraction to our school will encourage every student to work harder and become better students along with better learners.\n\nIn depth, the increased need to work hard and utilize the skills learned through extra curricular activities will increase the grades, performance, and attentiveness of many students in class and outside of class.\n\nAll in all, this decision will not only grow myself along with my classmates, but the school in a whole.\n\nThe third and final reason why I agree and wholeheartedly support the decision of my school is because both me and my schoolmates will be able to grow mentally, and physically through the extracurricular activities.\n\nFirst off, the improvements of the number of people participating in extracurricular activities will prove beneficial for people who are in study groups.\n\nAs a result of the increased amount of people taking extracurricular activities, an increased amount of people will join study groups which will allow more sharing of knowledge through older members and newer members.\n\nSecondly, sports teams will be able to have more competition, therefore increasing the skill gap between players.\n\nMore people participating in extracurricular activities means more people trying out for sports teams which results in a higher demand to play for the team, whether it be basketball, soccer, football or other sports, the high demand will cause an increase in specific member choosing for the teams and will also cause an increase in team spots, therefore increasing the skill of the teams and creating more ways for myself and other students to play sports and grow ourselves physically through those sports.\n\nLastly, mental sports teams like chess, Sudoku, and other mental sports, will see the same increase.\n\nSpecifically an increase of mental capacity being held by our school's students, and with this increase in mental capacity needed to play games like chess, it causes an increase in schoolwork performance, and other schoolwork related items such as tests and quizzes.\n\nThe improvement in mental and physical prowess being presented will surely produce results for my schoolmates in the future to come.\n\nThe addition of mandatory extracurricular activities to our school will prove to be a promising and progressive choice.\n\nFirstly, students are going to able to practice unknown activities, find new passions, and find new friends while still growing themselves.\n\nSecondly, these growing skills and hard work that will come to be expressed by both me and my schoolmates will prove beneficial not only for us, but for the school as well.\n\nFinally, students will be able to express their mental and physical growth and increase that mental and physical growth through these extracurricular activities.\n\nI believe without a doubt that the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities is the best decision our school has ever made. ",

      "Would you like to be forced to do something you don't want to do? Of course not, students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities if they don't want to. We need to stand up for student rights, they should have the choice if they want to do activities or not. There are many reasons to support this like, the cost of essential items, students not having a way home, and most importantly most kids have to take care of younger siblings and wouldn't have time.\n\nFirstly, forcing students to do after school activities is not fair, and neither is the price to pay for it. The average cost for sports equipment if five hundred dollars, and most families can't pay that. Lets say your child decides to not do a sport and chooses to be on student council, and they have a meeting at 7:00 in the evening, someone is gonna have to take them, so there goes at least thirty dollars in gas money. So do yourself and your kids a favor and be against it.\n\nSecondly, if your child has to do an after school activity, they must get home somehow. Most parents don't get off work till six o-clock, and lets say your kids practice ends at five o-clock, or maybe even four o-clock, your child would be alone at school for more than an hour, and thats a long time. No child should have to be alone for that long and doing something they don't want to do.\n\nLastly, if your child has younger siblings and they have to take care of they after school, they wont have time for other activities. Generic_Name is a fourteen year old girl and has a three year old sister named Generic_Name . Every day she comes home and plays with her, feeds her, and gives her everything she needs while mom is at work. If Generic_Name has to stay after school for an activity, what would Generic_Name do? This was the most important reason, kids just don't have time.\n\nIn conclusion, we can all agree that students should not be forced to do after school activities, the cost is to much, they may not have a way home and they might hot have time because of younger siblings to take care of. Don't let someone force your kid to do an activity they don't want to do. Next time your at a parents meeting for your kids school and the principle asks for who is against all students being forced to do an extracurricular activity, raise your hand for the sake of you and your loving, passionate kid.    ",

I believe the principal is right in this decision. Doing these activities is an essential in these students lives. These students must start participating in extracurricular activities.\n\nMany students need to know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities. Students need to learn how to do activities, such as playing basketball. Basketball also gives a lot of exercise, which is very important for students. If students start playing games, such as basketball, they will know what it is like to participate in extracurricular activities, how to work together, and how to make decisions. I believe that participating in sports such as basketball is very important to students.\n\nSome students may already do extracurricular activities, but it is important to learn how to do other activities. It is important that students learn how to do other activities, not just one activity. If students learned how to do other activities, they can learn many other things.

When Julian and other students became highschoolers, the principle wanted the students to take at least one extracurricular activity. "I guess I\'ll try out for football then," said Julian. "I will join robotics club," continued Sasha. "It\'ll be good for college credit," said Sasha. "And it\'ll be good for your health if you do any kind of sports," said Julian. Students should take at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future, students will get healthier if they join a sports team, and students will make for friends.\n\nStudents should at least take one extracurricular activity because it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future. First, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then students will find the job that they want. For example, when Johnny did multiple activities in school, he knew that he wanted to be an artist because he liked to draw and he was good at it. Also, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then they will make can make lots of money. For instance, Jared wanted to be a computer programmer and make lots of money so he joined a club about computers. In conclusion, if it gives students more opportunities for jobs in the future then students will live happier life.\n\nStudents should at least take one extracurricular activity because students will get healthier if they join a sports team. First, if students get healthier then they won\'t get sick. For example, before Jerry join a sports team, he got sick a lot but after he joined a sports team he barely gets any cold. Secondly, if students get healthier then students mood changes. For instance, Tom was always sad or get mad but after he joined a sports team he got much happier. To summarize, if students get healthier then they will have a better life.\n\nStudents should at least take one extracurricular activity because students will make lots of friends. First, if students make lots of friends then students won\'t be lonely.

      "Imagian getting home from school at around five and then doing homework till like seven or eight sounds crazy right well thats what will happen if students are fourced to do an extracurricular activity. Us students simply wouldn't have time for anything else which is why I disagree with making students dp a curricular activity. Some of us students just don't have the time and are far to busy with things like getting home late, doing homework or studing, plus some kids babysit.\n\nThe first reason I disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. Parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. Plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.\n\nThe second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. If you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. This will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. Which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.\n\nThe third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin. However, with an after school activity they will not return home in time to watch said family members. And lets not forget that some students have jobs as babysitters for other people's kids.\n\nNow I understand that some people may say \"oh but it's good for young children to do an after school activity and I agree, however some students are far to busy and should not be fourced to do an after school activity its not that we're lazy or anything we'er just to busy.\n\nso in conclution i believe students should not be fourced into an extracurricular activity some of us are truely to busy for one being that we will get home late, have to much homework, and no time for friends, along with watching younger family members there is no time",

Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after school students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.\n\nExtracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to.

There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list.

They might be leaving a younger child alone, just because they have to participate in a sport or student council. There are things more important than extracurricular activities.\n\nStudents may also have an outside-of-school activity to participate in at the time. Many students choose to take lessons or sports outside of school. For example, they might have private instrument lessons, a neighborhood science club, or a sport team that isn't school-involved. These activities are just as important as school ones, and they shouldn't be forced to miss them because of requiring extracurricular clubs. The outside-of-school activities are often paid for, or require money in some way. This would lead to a loss of money for the parents, paying for lessons that the students can't attend. Students may lead busy lives, and they shouldn't have to have them taken up by even more school-required things.\n\nAnother reason school clubs shouldnt be enforced is that while buses and parent pick-up are often available at the end of the school day, it is not always the same when it's already been an hour after school. Parents also often have busy schedules, and they can't always be available to drive their student home. That is one reason why some students choose not to participate in extracurricular activities. But if students are being forced to stay after school, they might not have a ride home. This would create a problem, because then most of the school would need a bus ride home, and that would require a lot of buses and bus drivers. This would be very financially taxing for the school, so it would be better to just let students go home at the end of the school day. They have already been required to attend school for seven hours; it would not be fair to make them stay longer for something that isn't even education-related.\n\nIn summary, students have busy lives already, taken up by chores, family commitments, possible after-school jobs, schoolwork, and outside-of-school activities. They shouldn't be forced to add more things to their schedule. Extracurricular activities are meant to something fun and enjoyable in a student's free time, a choice to partake in something they find interesting. Making students attend extracurricular activities would take the fun out of it - it's supposed to a chance students can take, not another thing forced upon them. These students have lives to live, things to take care of, other time-consuming responsibilities in life that are more important than school-related ones. Let extracurricular activities remain as a choice for students.",

      "This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.\n\nMost students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.\n\nStudents tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.\n\nWe all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.\n\nPrincipals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things about doing a sport after school. You should go out and try for any sport you can and you can get better and better everyday. Nobody is holding you back from doing something you want to try doing.",

      "Why do nothing, when you can do something that will help you no and in your future?\n\nStudents should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nThe principle's choice to have every student to do an extracurricular activity is a good choice because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, Students get to meet kids that they normally wouldn't meet just in school, and students will get an example on what it is like to work with a team or group.\n\nFirst, it is good for students to participate in one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests.\n\nPeople that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.\n\nYou hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.\n\nBut, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.\n\nThe people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.\n\nFor example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.\n\nThe student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.\n\nThen eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.\n\nFinally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group.\n\nNext, it would be good for students to do an extracurricular activity because they will get to meet people that they normally wouldn't meet when you are in school.\n\nJoining a team or group will be nerve racking at first because you might not know anyone that share the same interests as you do.\n\nBut when the team/group finally gets to talking, they will have bonded so that nobody could break them apart.\n\nIt is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.\n\nIn school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.\n\nBut when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.\n\nPeople that you once thought were \"weird\", or \"annoying,\" are now your friends because you realized that they actually have the same personality that you do.\n\nFinally, it is important to do at least one extracurricular activity because students will get a taste of the real world in having to work as a team to get things done.\n\nIf students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.\n\nLearning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.\n\nSo the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.\n\nIf you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.\n\nNobody will hire you because they will look at your back round and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.\n\nNobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.\n\nFinally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.\n\nMost people don't want that, do you?\n\nIn conclusion, it would be smart for the principle to implement that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others that have their same interests, students will get to meet other students that they wouldn't normally meet in normal school time, and the students will get an example on what it is like to work as a team and to prosper at doing your work.\n\nStarting with an extracurricular activity now will not only help you now, but it will help you later in life too.        ",

      "Getting the kids to do things in school like different activities and things could help them so much and also have fun with school.\n\nCan you imagine going to school and being able to do other things besides learn? Going to school and getting to play sports during school can help with so many things in life. Going to school and playing sports like basketball, football and soccer and etc, playing those sports during school hours could be fun for the students. For the ones that love to play sports could have so much fun. Playing the sports you like can be fun but also can make you better at the things you do, it is like giving you practice outside of practicing with your team. Kids now in days need to at least do something active everyday. So therefore kids should at least be active of doing something for at least 60 minutes. So it is great to have kids participate in sports in school.\n\nKids working around schools with technology is also being active in a way. Yearbook is an example of being active and also doing activities. Doing a activity that involves technology can make sure kids can learn things with the things that they are working with in school. Most students prefer using technology anyways so it should also be fun. Technology has games and writing and reading and etc. Those things can help kids have fun but also learn things at the same time. Kids do need to read and write but they can also try to have fun with it if teachers added activities to it. Another thing that can help the students in school is to have at least at 3 min break but also use there technology at the time. These are examples on why students should have technology also as a activity during school.\n\nSchool could in vise you to do better with things in life, or become the things that you would like to be some day. Helping around at school, could help the teachers out or help the kids become something the want to become. Working with teachers and other students is a great way of participating in school. When you are participating you are also learning new things. Participating is a good way for students to be active.\n\nKids should participate in things more in school. Participating in sports is a great idea during school. However, technology is an activity that student's could work on. It is also a better way to have students learn. Also the school could always have students help out with teachers and things. This is why i think it is better to have student to participate in school with sports and different activities. ",

      "School can often be full of work piling up in the classes we don't enjoy, and stress that gets us down. What if there was a way to make school enjoyable for everyone? Extracurricular activities are teams, clubs, and any other organization run by the school. Many students like these because they have something to look forward to while in school, but not everyone always joins. I believe that students should become a part of organizations because it gives them a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and choose an activity that they enjoy.\n\nIn school activities that are outside of class, students have a chance to create bonds with new people. Teams and clubs require working together to make ideas come along, especially student council and sports. This also builds a work ethic for future jobs. Sometimes students may have trouble making friends, so being in a club makes it easy to meet people. Similar interests can also often lead to friendships. Students can also get to know a teacher who sponsors their club better, as many students rarely speak with them in class. Having a more interesting topic to discuss with teachers helps students feel more comfortable around them in class.\n\nStudents should become more involved in schools activities. As a yearbook staff member, I know that from experience. I have been able to go onto the basketball courts during pep rallies to get pictures, inform people and work with them about buying a yearbook, and learn about other class when I take pictures and collect information from them. Similarly to student government, students are able to see their hard work pay off when fellow classmates participate in spirit days and other events. With sports, athletes are able to show off their skill and passion for the game while being able to represent their school.\n\nLastly students are able to choose what they want to be a part of. Not everyone enjoys the problem solving of math or the memorization of history, but it is a requirement to take them. If students join an activity they'll enjoy, then they will have something to look forward to in school. This can also strengthen career paths. If a student is set on becoming a business leader, they can be a part of yearbook or the other organizations that run like a business. If a student is determined to be in the NFL, then they can tryout for the football team. And if they don't find a fit for them, they should be able to make a group themselves. It's important to have a variety of clubs, including students' ideas.\n\nIn conclusion, schools should require their students to join extracurriculars just as they require them to take core classes. This is because it gives students a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and be a part of something that they would enjoy.\n\nStudents shouldn't dread school, and this is one way to make it better. ",

      "I think that every student should precipitate in something at school. This is a great idea because students could get more involved in school and they can always know whats going on. They could precipitate in things like sports, clubs, and just any other extracurricular activity. This activity does not have to be any everyday thing. It could be once every week or every other day.\n\nI think every student should precipitate in a sport or a club because it lead them to learning new things. Or it could open up new opportunities for them. Many students may not like this idea because school is already enough for them and they can't handle doing a sport or be in a club. I understand that but thats why all the clubs don't have to be school related. School can be very stressful and sometimes we need a break. So having these clubs during the middle of the day could impact how a lot of students preform in school. It could be a nice way to relax and get your mind off of the work you have to do but you would still be learning in a way.\n\nThis idea could also help build relationships, make new friends, and meet new people. At school on a daily basis you probably talk to the same people. If you are in a club or in a sport you would be able to meet new people and possibly expand your friend group. If you do not want to make new friends this is a great way to get closer with your friends because you would spend more time together and you would be learning together.\n\nThis could also make students find new intrest or hobbies. These intrest could end up being something they want to study in college. This idea is a good way for students to explore new things.\n\nI know that not many students like this idea because they might think that its a waist of time or maybe they can't find a club that their intrested in. This could lead to them making their own club. So every student has a chance to be in a club or sport.\n\nThis is a great idea and I think it should be put into play. ",

Collages like good grades but you would have a stronger resume if you did sports,or worked with the student council. Most collages are looking for someone that can do a variety of activities, doing clubs and sports shows them you have what it takes. Many adults have health problems due to the fact that they are not in shape and a great extracurricular activity is sports so starting at a young age will decrease you chances of having bad health problems. Sports are also fun to do, there are different varieties to choose from like soccer basketball,and dance. Clubs and sports can help you in real life situations. When you are older and start to have jobs, situations will come up when you have to work with other people and you have to be able to know how to lead. This is why extracurricular activities will help you in the future.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people and connect with others like you. In real life situations you want to know how to be able to talk to other people and the clubs and sports you join are great practice. When you are older and you have to try to impress people it will not come off like you are nervous because you have had practice. As you grow older you will not have school to make friends so you have to learn how to talk with people so you can connect and make potential life long friends. After school clubs and activities can help you with theses types of situations.\n\nPeople might argue that some students might not have their parents to take them home or have enough money for sports. Most schools provide after school buses so you can go home. This can be a very big help for parents because they will be coming home from work around that time and knowing that their child is safe a school will take some stress off of them. After school schedule usually line up better with work than a regular school day. Money shouldnt be and issue because school do these activities for free, but if something does come up where you have to pay than you could set something up with the school that will work for you and your family.

I feel like if you sign up for something school related then its showing that you really care about the school and actually wanna help people. Helping out other teachers and staff members are good ways to help the school.\n\nSecondly, the students that are athletes in their school can also play for the school so that the teachers and the staff members can see that other people like representing their school and they feel comfortable at this school. I love playing sports but its different for some schools that dont have any sports at their school. As you get older your mindset changes and it may become easier because you know what you want to do in the future. Yearbook or student council are 2 good ways to start off your career because if you start drawing or something in the yearbook you might want to become an artist.\n\nStudents Council is a hard job for the school but is a way to make yourself organized and prepare for challenges. Other Students in your school might want to run for students council and u might not have a chance to be able to have that position. It might be a little heartbreaking if someone else gets the position and you dont because you really thought that you were the best at it.

Students might not understand if they get the job/part they're gonna get money but since its just for the school its basically like participation for other job that teachers need to do.\n\nLastly. i think that its a great idea because it give students a chance to prove the staff members and teachers that they are actually good at something. The only thing that i thikn that im good at is doing flips and stuff like that. i have a little talent of srawing but im not the best.

      "Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.\n\nHaving students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.\n\nFor example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.\n\nForced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.\n\nForced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.",

      'Nine times out of ten children will get bad habits from not adding an extracurricular activity to their schedule.\n\nCausing them to be lazy and end up with bad grades. Because when you add at least one or more extracurricular activity to your schedule, it can help you be more social, get ready for high school, and have a healthier schedule.\n\nFirst, is being more social. When getting a new activity to do at the end of the day, you will end up with other people. Meeting different people is one of the ways to clear bad social habits. Because of the fact that they are in the same activity as you, some of them might have the same interests. This can cause you to have new friends, this will help you work with others. Working with others is a good factor when you have an extracurricular, and it\'s not as hard as opinions might think. Working with others has a bad side to it because of this you could get annoyed, but you can get use to it by building tolerance .\n\nThe second reason is, that it helps you get ready for high school. To get ready for high school you are going to need a good GPA score meaning you need a high grade if not higher. Getting an extra activity can help you if not guide you to the higher GPA. Sometimes the teachers will give you extra credit activities or let you finish work that you want to get done.\n\nThe third and final reason is building a healthy schedule. Building a healthy schedule is very important because it can effect what you do now and what you will do in the future. When you add something to your schedule it will help you be able to take hard and stressful tasks. This will help you when ever you dont have a lot of people around to help.\n\nNow some people might say that it\'s "too hard","I just dont need it" , or " it takes too much time". But student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. This counter argument dose not compute with what is needed.\n\nIf adding an extra curricular activity to a students time, then it will give them social skills, lead them to high school, and help build a healthy schedule. These are the main things that students need to be successful.',

      "What ! The principle is making us participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I remember when I was forced as a kid to do that, I didnt like it at all. I disagree with this statement because, first off some students might not have time to do the extra activity's, secondly the students work hard enough as it is in school, lastly it might be the least favorite thing they do especially if they have to get forced into participating in extracurricular.\n\nWell to start, some students can't stay after, they might need to go home and babysit or watch out for their siblings. Secondly, some kids might have hours of homework that they need to do, they might not have time for extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have after school sports like baseball or football games and they would like to attend to instead of playing or doing something after hours that doesnt matter as much as students sport.\n\nNext, students work all through out the day with hardly any breaks, students want a break from having to deal with taking down notes and hearing a teacher talk for hours. Secondly, lot's of students are stressed out with grades and family problems, so why make them more stressed out by forcing them to do extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have to follow the rules and listen to teachers daily, as a result the students wont be able to learn when to make decisions for them selves if they the teachers are always telling them what to do. Students need to know when to make the decision to stay or not stay, not to be forced.\n\nLastly, some kids dont like to do extra things like playing games or sports at school because it will make them very sweaty and sticky, the principle is also forcing them to stay. An addition, since the principle is not giving the students a choice they wont like it, but If there was a option that the kids could choose then it would be more enjoyable because they can choose when they want to stay or not stay. Lastly most students like to kick back and relax and spend some time inside their home. I personally would like to be home sometimes after school and watch some movies and fall asleep if I can.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with with this statement because, it's not fair for a student to be forced into staying after to do extracurricular activities. It's also not right to be forced to stay, especially if a student had to take care of personal business like taking care of family. Principles should already know what could go on at a house, so they need to be more reasonable when it comes to adding on to a persons schedule. I still cant believe that the principle is making everyone stay and participate in at least one extracurricular activity.     ",

      "Your principal has decided that students are required to take at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree with this? I agree with this because you may want to stay interested in any of your schools activities. It is important because students want to stay active with there schools and the best way by doing that is by having something for students to experience. Schools have activities for students to do after school because they want them to stay active. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students gain responsibility, helps get students motivated, benefit their college and job application.\n\nFirst things first, having extracurricular activities can help students gain responsibility because in some cases students will be doing things that take someone with responsibility to do. For example, students that are in sports are responsible for having the appropriate shoes and clothes for their practices. This is one reason why activities, that certain schools have, are important. This will motivate students to do better and they would want to succeed in whatever they are doing. This leads me to my second reason.\n\nSecondly, it could help students get motivated to do better in school. This is important because extracurricular activities require you to have good grades and if you like one of the activities you are doing you will be motivated to do good so that you can stay in it. This can allow tons of students to be successful in school and they will try hard in school. Students might want to do certain activities that require them to have good grades and if they don't then they can't do it. This is why in order to do what you like you need to do good in school and it is very important to do good in school.\n\nLastly, extracurricular activities will benefit you when you are trying to apply for a job or just trying to get into a college of your choice. The first thing is that it may help you look good when putting whatever you did on your paper. For example, someone can put they did track and then they got an award for winning a competition, that would make their paper look good. Another example is that if you want to get a specific job and you are in a certain club were they teach you about the job could really benefit you. Like stated in the previous paragraph, it could help you take care of your grades and if you do have good grades colleges would want you. This could help you in the long run because it is important to have some experience with what job you want. Extracurricular activities can help you get to know how you feel about this and if you want to do this in the future.\n\nIn conclusion many students need to be responsible in order to keep the activity they want. Students will become motivated to do better so that they can stay in that certain activity. Students will have the experience and they will be able to get the job that they want. These reasons prove on why it is important to have extracurricular activities. This is why I agree on how students should be entitled to at least on activity because it helps students gain responsibility, helps students get students motivated, and it helps students on their job application and college application.                ",

    ESSAY:
      "Haven't you ever been so tired to listening to a subject that you seem to dislike? Wanting a break but never able to since its for a grade, well your principal has decided that you can participate in an activity you might like! You can be in a sport, work on the yearbook, or even serve in the student council! I for sure love this idea! It helps kids look forward to something that might not be as tiring and boring as the subjects of schools, run around in basketball, be creative in art class, be inspirational as you work on the yearbook, or help others and the principals being a part of the student council! It all helps in the school system and you might make a change, for example, Generic_Name, a senior in one of the highest ranks high school in Japan, was a student councilor that helped hundreds of students from doing a bad choice, grades, or just be someone to talk to. The principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity, and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.\n\nFirst, it'll make you look forward about something during your day. You might have had a bad day but then you might remember that you're going to maybe you favorite topic class and that might brighten up you day a lot more. It'll be like a small break you get other then lunch. You get to talk with your friends and maybe even your favorite teacher and learn new tactics in the class you might like. A moment class where you can relax and hang out and get grade in too! A lot of high schools, if not all, let you pick the class you wanna be in and you may have other choices too. It's a matter of your and luck but always worth it.\n\nSecond, I'll be talking about how you might socialize more. You might not get what I'm saying so I'll just straight up say it, you don't always have to be quiet unless, of course, the teacher is talking. You get to be in groups and learn from each other and depending on what your doing you will get a different pack. For example, if you were to be in a basketball team, you going to see different cons and pros on each player but you'll all will have to work with each other to accomplish you goal, if your working on the yearbook you will all have to speak to each other and work on the same task to show that sometimes two people make a better job then one. It can help you boost up your social skills and your skills with working with others even if you've never met them. Socializing its a big stage in our life that some are very afraid of and others not at all and this types of things will help you in case if you wanna make a business or be a doctor or police officer or anything, but communication is always the key that you wanna use.\n\nThirdly, this class may be the best of each year your in high school, you never know. It can be that class you'll always talk to your friends about after you graduate and have memories of. The class that brightened up your whole high school year into one of the amazing years ever, the one class that when ever you pass your old high school or have to speak about it thats the fist thing that comes into mind. That one class that cleared you mind and helped you with drama and other skills you might have needed to learn.\n\nIn conclusion, the principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity,and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school. This essay will help you understand why sometimes even having another extra class might help you in the future or at that exact moment.",

    ESSAY:
      "Can you believe that schools are now making students stay after-school to participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with schools having students participate in one extracurricular activity becasuse students need time for other activities outside of school, students need time with their families, and they need time to do their homework.\n\nMany students love coming home right when the school bell rings and having the rest of the day to do what they like. This is not the case at some schools. At my school our principal is having us participate in one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because students need time to play and practice sports such as basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer. Students also need time to hang out with their friends not just inside of school, but outside too. If a student is forced to stay after-school and there is nothing they like there than it may bother the students emotions and make them sad. If a student is sad or upset about this it may affect their participation, attendence, and effort. I do not want kids spending more time than they have to at school.\n\nThere are a ton of students who do not get to see their family at all due to school. Students need time to be with their family and socialize with them like playing a board game or having a nice conversation. Extracurricular activities may interfere with the time that kids have to spend with their families. It is very important that kids spend time with their families because it keeps their mental health well, keeps them in line, and provides comfort for them. It keeps their mental health stable because they do not worry about seeing their parents or when they will see their parents again. It keeps them in line because they have somebody to tell them what is ok and what is not ok and they have somebody to discipline them. It provides comfort for kids because they know somebody or some group of people are there for them. If students had no time to spend with their family it would most likely casue many problems for them.\n\nDid you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen.\n\nOnce again, I believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework. If time that students have for these activities gets taken away by school it may lead to something bad. If you do not agree with me please think about this again and if you do agree with me that is great because you are thinking the right way.",

      "I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.\n\nLike other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and\n\nMaybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.\n\nThere are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.\n\nIf you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",

    ESSAY:
      "Generic_Name is making the whole school participate in at least one after school sport. Although most kids arent happy with this i certainly am!\n\nI agree that you should participate in at least one activity after school because, its good exercise for you, its only one activity and its a break from watching TV all day and being on your phone.\n\nThe first reason you should do an after school activity is because, its good exercise, doing an after school sport can make you a healthy person because of the constant movement and running you do in most sports. For example sumo wrestlers usually lose up to 30,000 calories a day which is insane isnt it. You dont know how much impact a sport has on your health. Another example of sports being good exercise for you is when your constantly at practice in you do drills like running or in ice hockey when you move around back and fourth, or when in wrestling your sprawling and consistently moving. Stuff like that is the best exercise you can get these days. Or even if its not a sport it can be exercise, when your just walking you are burning calories. everything you do burns calories, even breathing.\n\nMoving on to my second reason on why you should do an after school activity is because its only one activity you have to do. Its not like its for 3 hours everyday of the year. Its not a huge birdin you have to do, its probably only like an hour and 30 mins a day or less for only like a season. But if your that lazy just do something simple and easy that dosent last long at all. Then you'll get your one activity you have to do out of the way so you can spend the rest of your year after school how you would like. The only reason i see you can't stay after school for an activity is because your family needs you everyday after school, or you have a little brother to take care of, things like that. If anything it might motivate you to do more activities after school, or join a league outside of school. All Im saying is its only a little bit of time out of your day so dont sweat it.\n\nMy Finale reason why i agree you should do at least one after school activity is because it gets you away from your phone. Instead looking on instagram and checking out snap chat. Your in the real world doing something instead of posting a selfie for the internet. While your staying after school to do an activity some lazy guy at home is just playing video games in his basement which is not helping him out, or getting the exercise he needs. Plus one day your not gonna be able to do this. Your just gonna sit in a cubical all day working on stuff and doing papers from 9 am to 5 pm. But you seriously need this because you can't be on your phone or the internet for the rest of your life.\n\nIn Conclusion i agree that we all should do one sport or activity after school because in reality its good exercise, dosent take that long and its better then looking at your phone. It wont kill you to do a sport and its not that hard. You'll be find doing an after school activity. Once the season is over for the sport your doing then your done, you've gotten it over with             ",

After school students might can't do after school do to family problems, stressed, or just don't want to do those things. I also disagree because you can't force a person who dosen't want to do something you want them to do for after school.\n\nfamily problems, a lot of student go through alot when it comes to family and just don't have the time because earthier something tradect happened or someone in there family died and thats hard on student when it comes to a family member dyeing or something bad happens. some students dont also have the time because there parent have to work and the student has to watch its brother or sister and just cant saty after school because of that. Student Can't stay after school because there parents need help around the house after school and sometimes they don't have a ride to get home or they don't have a bus to ride.\n\nAfter school a lot of student are stressed because of school work, grades and homework. At school you sometimes a lot of classes and you just get really stressed because you can't keep up with the school work. Grades are a big factor at school because without good grades you sometimes can't do the stuff you want to and the grade affects some of your stuff. homework some kids dont have the time to stay after school because they have a lot of homework and sometimes home work affects your after school activities. Stressed is one of the biggest factors of not wanting to do after school.\n\nSome students are not good at a lot of thing like sports, or clubs or they just dont like those things. Student shouldn't be forced to do something that they arent good at. sometimes they don't know what to do or they could get embarrassed in front of the kid that are good at it. They could make fun of those kids and laugh at them because they are not good at it what they were forced too do after school.\n\nConclusion- students should not have to do what they dont want to do after school because its just not right to force a student to do something they don't want to do after school",

      "Did you know that one out of every four schools don't let students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that this is unfair and students should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Imagine not being able to participate in many fun skill-learning activities.\n\nWhile others believe that participating in an extracurricular activity is a waste of time, I believe that it is not.\n\nI agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as, it will make school a better place for students to be in, it will be a chance for students to make more friends or meet new people and kids will improve their skills or learn new skills.\n\nExtracurricular activities will make school a better place for students to attend. It will also encourage kids to want to go to school everyday because they will be looking forward to that one or more extracurricular activity. Many kids don't want to attend school everyday because they have so much things going on like homework, projects, tests etc. Extracurricular activities will help relief the stress many kids go through everyday, it will get their mind off all the things going on at home. When I was having a bad day at school, I always remembered that I was going to stay after school for Art club that day and that cheered me up.\n\nExtracurricular activities will also be the chance for students to make friends and meet new people. It is most likely the kids you meet in that extracurricular activity will be interesting in the same thing as you are. For example if you meet someone that likes and plays the same sport as you, you guys will have something in common. One time I attended the Spanish Culture club and I met a lot of new people that I had in common with, everyone spoke Spanish and was from South America.\n\nExtracurricular activities will improve kids skills or teach them new skills. It is good for a kid to know many skills because it will help them later in life, it doesn't hurt to learn new skills or to improve them. When I joined my school's dance team I learned a lot of new skills, for example turns, jumps, new choreography etc. I also improved how flexible I was and how far I could do my splits. By the end of the school year I learned how to properly do my splits and also some jumps. Joining the dance team really helped me in a lot of ways.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons such as it will make school a better environment and a better place in general, it will be a chance for students to make more friends and meet more people and kids will improve some previous skills they have or they will learn new skills. ",

      "Imagine living in a world where you had to do every single activity. I disagree that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because not everybody has time to do activities. Most kids are still in school and get homework and have to study for test and can't ever do activities.\n\nHere are some of my reasons why I disagree. Parents have to work. See not all parents have the time to be driving there kid places if they're busy at home or at work. Some parents have to work late so they can have money. Parents have a lot of responsibilities.\n\nReasons why we don't have time to do extracurricular activities is because they cost a lot of money. I used to do gymnastics when I was younger but I had to quit because my mom didn't always have the money to pay for it. I was so upset when I figured out I had to quit but I was strong because I can always do it again in the future. So sometimes our parents are struggling and we can't help but to quit. Just because our parents don't have time or money to do it now doesn't mean we can't do what we love in the future.\n\nDon't forget about us kids! We have tons of work to do at school and have to study and sometimes projects for school and its so overwhelming! If we have so much to do how could we ever to do an extracurricular activity! Doing extracurricular activities can also take up the time that you might just want to yourself. Some people don't even like doing activities which means they would but doing they're not happy doing and it's not fun to do something you don't like. These are my reasons why I don't think that all students need to do at least one extracurricular activity.",

      "You just got home from school and you relax for a while then you are going to study and do homework. But you are forced by your school to do a sport or be in the student council so now you have less time to study. I think that student should not have to do something outside of school if they don't want to like playing a sport or working on the year book.\n\nFirst being forced to work on something you don't want to do can put more stress on kids. Lets say if you are forced to play a sport and you have no athletic ability and you hate that sport with a passion it can make you miserable, you have to spend a lot of time with a sports team and that can really be bad if you don't like it. If a kid cant get his homework done because of something he is forced to do that can also put a lot of stress on kids not being able to get work done. If kids are forced to do something they hate it can really have a negative effect on them and their grades.\n\nAlso having to do other stuff outside of school that you don't want to do can take away from them having fun and playing with friends. Many kids now don't get outside as much as kids used to, and having them trapped not being able to do what they want can take away from them being kids. Having kids not being able to hang out with friends can make them not as happy and they can lack good social skills. You can see that forcing kids to do stuff they shouldn't have to do is a bad thing, this can suck for the kids if they have to do this.\n\nHowever getting kids to do other stuff can help them get off there screens. Kids are playing video games way too much these days and getting them a new activity can help get them off. Playing a sport could help kids loose weight and be more fit so they are not unhealthy. This can be good but, making a kid play a sport they don't want to do can make it so they don't try in the sport and don't give any effort because they don't like it. No one wants to play a sport they are not good at. This is why kids should not be forced to do something they don't need to do.\n\nNow you can see how making kids do something they don't need to do is bad. I think schools should not make kids do something school related that doesn't count towards grades. I hope schools don't do this and that kids can just be themselves.",

    Essay: "Have you ever had the chance of doing an activity after school? I've had the opportunity and I'm glad I took it and it also helped me a lot. Some schools provide extracurricular activities, those can benefit you and others with new friendships, try new things, and if you have a dream that you want to pursue you can get the help that you need.\n\nOne reason why students should attend extracurricular activities is to make new friendships. I remember this one time when I was still in elementary, I didn't know anyone, I completely felt left out. Until a group of girl came up to me because they felt bad. After that I realized that when I was stuck on a bad situation something good could come out of it. With that I encourage you to branch out and make new friends because you never know when you need them.\n\nAnother reason can be students have the ability to try new things. When someone thinks of this it may seem scary to them but, it will improve skills and help a person find their true passion. Lets say that a girl's into crafts, she would be put in a activity related to her liking. Someone's into sports or would want to engage in one, they can work on that in hopes of getting in a activity that assures their needs. Simply this can help make someone find a passion if their not set on anything yet or it can help pursue a dream.\n\nA I stated before trying new things can lead to pursuing a dream. Some students already have in their minds what they want to do as a future career. Once my mom and I went to one of these activities a while ago, and one of them stuck out to me, interior designing. After introducing myself to this kind of program I realized that I want this to be my next dream in life. What I'm saying is that pursuing a dream isn't hard, theres so many opportunities and doors that will open for you, but only if you let them.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone should do an extracurricular activity. Right now it may not seem as much or it may seem boring to some people but what it consists of may help you like making new friendships that then lead you to try new things and then you end up pursuing a dream or thinking of one. These activities are just a way to help you and others branch out into the world because, everyone deserves a little fun here and there!",

    Essay: "Imagine getting back home from school and sitting on your couch, bored out of your mind, and just waiting for something interesting to come your way.\n\nI know from personal experience, that if kids don't have some sort of extracurricular activity going on they will simply sit and stare at their phone for hours on end.\n\nIf schools provide things such as sports, teams, and clubs then it will prevent kids from staring at their phones all day long. I think schools should require some sort of after school activity because it will get them out of their comfort zone, it can be something to look forward to, and it exposes kids the same age with similar interest to eachother.\n\nFirst, extracurricular activities can help kids get out of their comfort zones. If kids are required to do something then they don't have an excuse not to join a club or sports team. Some students don't do a sport or club because they fear they won't be good enough or may be a burden to the team. However, if they go out and try their hardest they may find that they are a very valued teammate. Some students are shy and more to themselves, but being apart of a group that brings out the best in you is an amazing experience that everyone should experience.\n\nSecondly, kids can look forward to doing something fun instead of going home and doing nothing. For example, when I first moved to Virginia I had absolutely nothing to do because I didn't have many friends. I was very sad and misserable until spring soccer tryouts. Until I started geting new friends, all I looked forward to was soccer practices and soccer games. Soccer really let me release all my stress, forget about everything, and really focus on the game.\n\nLastly, sports and clubs allow kids the same age to interact. Kids who are more shy can be exposed to kids who share similar interest. Sports especially require team work, which provides a strong bonding experience. I have made so many friends just by being apart of a team and getting close enough to where it is almost a family. Clubs can have the same affect on people.\n\nIn conclusion, sports and clubs are an amazing outlet to getting out of your comfort zone, looking forward to doing something, and making new amazing friends. In addition, most students are already involved in an extracurricular activity. It wouldn't really impact the amount of students getting involved in sports or clubs. I think that if schools were to require students to be involved in extracurricular activities it would have a positive outcome.",

    Essay: "Not everyone can attend school, do homework, and hang out with friends and family all in the same day. Sometimes us students need a break. We attend a lot of things outside of school, and we attend school itself. Shouldn't that be enough? Well not exactly according to my principal. My principal has decided that every student in my school should participate in an extracurricular activity. But why should we have an extracurricular activity to add to our day, when we already take part in so much? I disagree with my principal for these three reasons, we need our free time, we already attend activities outside of school, and it will overly stress students.\n\nSchool is difficult for many students, but to some it's easy. No matter if it's easy or difficult every student needs a bit of free time in there life. If we added extracurricular activities to our everyday lives, we would end up with so little free time that we would call it a break. Without free time to do what you want, you would probably die of boredom. Free time gives you time to do things that are under your control, just make sure not to break a law. For example you can go outside and play basketball, but you can change up the rules and make it your own game. In school you can't make your decisions or your rules, it is all based on your principal or teachers rules. It's like when you're writing an essay, instead of letting you write it your own way, your teacher will give you specific rules you have to follow while writing it. However, in your free time you can make your specific rules that make your game and day more enjoyable. My principal doesn't understand that outside of school we have lives, and free time helps our lives become more fun.\n\nNot only do I care for free time, I also care for my soccer team that I attend after school. Students don't only need free time they also need time for activities like sports, clubs, etc. Now the only reason I'm disagreeing with my principal is because he/she said I must attend an extracurricular activity. Some students don't have a club or sports team to attend, so an extracurricular activity would be a great idea for these people. It should be an optional activity to attend not mandatory. The soccer team I'm on at the moment is really great because it allows me to spend time with friends. It is also a great help with exercise and staying outdoors. It is very competitive, and in the end whether you win or lose your still having fun out there no matter what.\n\nSchool and homework itself causes students stress, if you were to add another activity for school, students would stress even more. We have a lot of things to do in our everyday lives such as, attending school, doing homework, spending quality time with friends and family, and attending sports teams. All these activities add up to hours and hours of your day. School is 6 hours and 45 minutes, homework will take you 1-3 hours, and sports practices are usually 1 hour and 30 minutes. You never know how much time you're going to spend with friends and family. Not only that but you need free time and sleep! To add an extra activity to all of that would just be absurd. You would be falling apart at the end of the day if you had to fit in time for an extracurricular activity. Repeating this until the weekend would just be absolutely miserable.\n\nIn conclusion, students think that they already have enough activities in there everyday lives to add more. If we were to add more to the day it would just be unnecessary and more stressful for students. I think my principal should change mandatory to optional. You might have things going on outside of school that are more important then making a yearbook look nice. I even think students shouldn't take part in homework, because even that is stressful. So why should we have an extracurricular activity to add to our day, when we already take part in so much? I disagree with my principal for these three reasons, we need our free time, we already attend activities outside of school, and it will overly stress students.",

An examples is that they go to playground when ever they want to go because to helps the students to lose energy and feel alive as a very young adult.

    Essay: "A frantic middle schooler had just received a load of homework from all of her teachers. Packets upon worksheets upon study guides that all needed to be done tonight. If she had to stay after school there would be no time for chores that needed to be done and the homework. Children and parents have the right to choose if they would want to do after school. Not all parents and students would agree with having after school mandatory. Is having a madatory after school really benificial.\n\nStudents should be able to choose if they want to do after school. Some students have a lot of homework already that the teachers give out, so most students are spending a sunny day inside doing homework after a long day at school and a long after school activity. Many students have stress and are overwhelmed by having too much homework and after school right after that. Most students have enough work that had to be done during school. Why push it so they have to stay longer and do more work than they should. Adding after school to the schedule will make more busy parents frustrated because they are the ones who have to pick up their child. The after school schedules does not meet up with the parents schedule and it make everything chaotic and difficult. Students and Parents have a routine that they do everyday but, if you add a mandatory after school it messes up the routine.\n\nMaybe its not just the students and the parents who are frustrated because most of teachers will be too. Teachers had a long day of having to put up with back talk and misbehaving kids at school. They just want to go home and relax with their family. Teachers also have duties at home just like kids, but they have to grade students work and enter it into a online system. If teachers have to put after school into their schedule many teachers would be really tired and exhausted from working before school until after school. Teacher have a life outside of school just like the kids that attend school do so, it really should be their choice if they want to do after school or not. Not just teachers but faculty and staff will have to do double the work and double the cleaning from after school. Students are not the only one that need a break.\n\nAfter school can affect the community in different ways. One way is by have a lot of cars and buses on the road while other people are trying to go home from work. The road will be filled with cars and buses clogging up the streets. Another way is that children and teens might have sports they have to be at. If you add after school they would not make it in time. Siblings have to go places too and they need their parents to drive them places but the parent is stuck picking up their child from after school. Schools should be worried if they have all of the children doing different thing, some outside, some in classrooms, some behind the school. It can be hard to keep track of them all.\n\nBasically, the child should have a choice weather or not they want do after school or not. Parent would want after school to fit into their routine, their schedule not the schools. Not just that it fits into schedule but some parents and children do not like what the school has to offer. After school is a choice because students, teachers, parents, and the community need the choice if they want after school or not. One way to help everyone is by giving everyone a choice and condensing after school into a small thing.",

    Essay: "Most of the time when a student comes back from school they go home and relax, procrastinate and maybe do their homework; this is most students, but not all. Extracurricular activities can either be fun and exhilirating or dull and exhausting; it all depends on what the student enjoys doing. If a student loves to move around all the time, they don't want to just sit around and do nothing. Student's that enjoy wasting thier time doing unnecesary things, suffer from it. If someone was to be placed with their friends doing something that they usually wouldn't do, they would do it, because that is the influence your friends have on you. If your friends like to skip class, you are eventually going to skip class. If your friends are excellent in school, you will be excellent in school. I agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing; it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college. I also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues and it could reduce stress.\n\nExtracurricular activities would help students do something productive, instead of wasting their time by making sure that they alsways keep themselves busy and get them to understand that you can never get time back, once it's gone, it's never coming back, so they should do something productive with it that will help them in the future. Hopefully they can teach those students, to do something now, that your future self will thank you for. Extracurricular activities can help students overcome their struggles, for example; if a student who procrastinates took joined a club for time management they would learn ways to finish their work on time and not worry about overdue assignments. In order for students to succeed in school and be succesfull in the future, there are certain obstacles they must overcome in order to succeed; hopefully extracurricular activities can do just that.\n\nFor the students trying their hardest to get into college, your GPA and SAT scores are not the only thing Colleges look at. Colleges and Universities want to see the kind of person you are, otherwise we're all just numbers; what that means is, if Colleges see that someone was on the student council or was the president of their club, they are going to be impressed by it, because it shows that that person has leadership skills, and colleges need leaders, not followers. There has been numerous occasions when an average studeent that participated in activities got accepted by their dream college as opposed to an excellent student that never participated in activities and got declined by the college they applied to; why? Because colleges can't see the type of person you are and what skills you possess based off of test scores and how well you did on an assignment, a letter does not define you. Just because someone did well on a test than another doesn't mean they are better than the other. The way the schooling system works is like a puzzle some students fit in that puzzle, others don't.\n\nExtracurricular activities with friends is fun and exhilirating; your friends make you laugh and make you happy, happiness releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a wonderfull mood. However not everyone has friends and not everyone has social skills. Those that are socially akward, can create a club and learn how to talk to poeple so they can make friends. Clubs, and sports are all extracurricular activities that involve others and the more you hang around a person the more comfortable you are around them the easier it is to talk to them and become friends . People will mental health issues or have stress from school can go to their extracurricular activity to relax and have a good time. As it states in paragraph two, extracurricular activities helps people finish their work so they don't have to stress about it therefor reducing stress levels., dopamines reduce depression and anxiety; furthermore mental health issues don't become as big as an issue as it was before.\n\nI agree with making sure everyone has atleast one extracurricular activity because it would help students do something productive instead of wasting their time doing nothing; it would give students motivation to stop procrastinating and finish their work on time. Colleges also look at your extracurricular activities so it would definitely help the student trying to get into college.\n\nI also believe that this will be good for some of the students with mental health issues, it could also reduce stress. Student's that procrastinate and waste their time, have friends that do the same. They can meet new people with better habbits and join clubs to help overcome that so they can better their performance in school. Hopefully they can teach those students to do something now, your future self will thank you for. As for Colleges, they want to see personality, otherwise we're all just numbers, and colleges don't want numbers they want bright people. If you show leadership skills in clubs or sports, colleges will be impressed by it, because colleges need leaders, not followers. As for mental health, friends make you laugh and make you happy, feeling happy releases dopamines to your brain that that puts you in a great mood. Extracurricular activities helps people finish their work so they don't have to stress about it therefor reducing stress levels, dopamines reduce depression and anxiety so mental health issues don't become as big as an issue as it was before.

    Essay: "I am dissagreing because some reasons that really should be thought of. One of my reasons is that its the teen or the childs chocie because lets say they wanted to work at a hut dog truck they would not have a thing for that and its not there passion. That brings me to my next thing there passion there passion could be not wanting to do one of the options the principal is giving. Now my next reason is if they really cant do them they could have a bone that does not let do some stuff so like sports is probaly out of the picture. Now let me give you the reasons behind why I think the principal should not do this.\n\nThe main reason america is america is because of freedom someone should not tell you to do something thats not important. Lets say a kid is getting forced to do something like run but thats just a random man saying it he or she does not have to run at all see what I mean. Ok think about that but just imagine it at school getting forced to do it even if you dont want to. Likes lets say im a nerd and all I like doing is work but I dont have time for the other stuff so it would really affect my learning skills.\n\nNow on to my second reason there passion this kinda brings me back the the freedom thing the principal is trying to force a hobby tho and thats not cool at all. What if they dont like any of them and they dont find it fun at all. Maybe if there was just things you can sign that would let you do it if you want would be good. My school does that if you want to do a sport or office type things they give you a pecie of paper you parents have to sign and you do too. So think about it forcing someone to do something they dont like the only thing there going to do is procrastinait.\n\nOk now my last reason if they cant even do it now your probaly they cant do what thats the thing the person could have something specail about they and can effect them when there trying to do stuff. I could have a forever broken arm and im pretty sure all the hoobies need at least two arms. And the fact that there is no hoobies that need no arms is dumb I cant belive one person could not think of one hobby like really.\n\nThose are my reasons on why the principal should not force hoobies to people if they dont want them so thank you for your time and good night.",

    Essay: "Some ways to success can start when your young. I believe extracurricular activities should be incorporated in all kids schedule. After school clubs such as political clubs and science clubs help students think creatively giving them advantages in those subjects. Extracurricular activities also help guide people down their paths. These programs are giving kids extra knowledge in things they want to learn about, like math. NFL players like Aaron Rodgers did extracurricular activities like football to learn the game and he used those skills on his path, and now he is in the NFL. Although these activities can be time consuming and take away homework time from other classes, that is a small price to pay for something that can help your future so much. Like Aaron Rodgers said \"Put in work now to have a better future later.\"In conclusion extracurricular activities can teach valuable lessons and help people with their future.\n\nIf you have free time and are looking to learn, extracurricular activities could be for you. They give you something to do at times that you could be bored. They have you learning at all times. These activities tend to boost your confidence. Learning about an activity giving you more experience in it causes some people to feel more confident when talking about that activity. Even if your playing a sport, your learning about the sport. These activities set you up with knowledge and guide you down the path of success. In conclusion extracurricular activities cause success and confidence.\n\nExtracurricular activities can help kids build friendships. These actives help kids meet peers with common interest. This also allows the chance for these kids to learn teamwork which is a valuable skill in the real world. This can create an environment where kids might feel comfortable and be able to share their feelings with trusted adults or friends. With some of these activities like sports, this allows kids to get their needed sixty minutes of exercise everyday.

Numerous amount of people, like adults and high school graduates, recommend the youth to take an extracurricular because it helps when achieve their goals. Students should do at least one extracurricular activity because of the benefits of being excepted into collage, having quality time with friends, and helping to decide a person's future.\n\nExtracurricular activities is a smart way of getting into collage. They can see what we are capable of and how that is useful to our lives. Collages also want to see us grow and get better at our unique talents. For example, when playing a sport we learn ways to improve, so that we can be boosted to a higher level. When collages see us taking a huge leap into varsity, they notice how hardworking we are at becoming our best. When getting into a university, it is also important to have a good attitude. If we have a passion for what we want to achieve in life it shows a positive and determent mind set.\n\nExtracurricular activities can also be a quality time to spend with friends. Sometimes outside of school, students don't get to see their friends and spend time with each other, but if they took an extracurricular activity they would be able to talk and have a great amount of time together. For example my friend and I can not spend time outside of school because of ride issues, so we decided to do an extracurricular activity and had a lot of time on the clock to talk with one another.\n\nAlthough we might take extracurricular activities for fun, it can also help us decide our future.

    Essay: "Imagine living in a world where children were healthier and adults actually cooperated well. It almost seems perfect right? Well, this is what our society could look like in the future if students were required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should be obligated to be involved in at least one after school activity because the child would be healthier, more social, less stressed, and more disciplined.\n\nExtra curricular activities, such as playing sports, can benefit the student's well being. The child would be kept in shape and would be more physically active. Keeping the child healthy could benefit him or her in the future by adding to the child's life span. Sports will also decrease the high obesity cases in our country. Obesity is a common issue in America due to the millions of fast food places and the limited exercise options. If the younger generations were forced to exercise, Americans would be more healthy and fit in the future. Students will not only be getting physically healthier, he or she will also become more mentally stable. Mental health is a common issue for children due to the excessive workload and pressure that school forces onto us; sports will provide an escape for the students. These are just a couple of the reasons why students should be obligated to be involved in at least one activity after school. The child will be healthier, happier, more mentally stable, and our obesity issues will decrease in our country.\n\nSome might argue that the students will be overwhelmed with extra activities but I strongly disagree. After-school activities will provide an escape for the child from the real world. Activities such as a book club, yearbook club, and a sports team can all provide different environments for a student to go to when feeling stressed from school or his or her life at home. The student will also learn to have a better work ethic, as well as a better understanding of discipline and cooperation. The student would not get stressed from these activities because the child would be too focused on improving him or herself.\n\nAfter-school activities will also help the child be more social. Being in different clubs or sports teams will expose the child to more social interactions, which can benefit his or her social life with friends and family. The student will also learn how to work better with other people in the community. This can help the community cooperate better and will improve the lives of many people. After-school activities will prevent the student from experiencing social isolation aside from school interactions with teachers or other students. He or she will learn to be a contributing member to the world. The student will be more disciplined which will help future work places run smoother. These are just a couple more reasons why students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. The child will be social, more of a team worker, and a better person in the society.\n\nAll in all, requiring students to be involved in any form of an after school activity can strongly benefit the student and society in the future. The students will be much healthier, more socially active, and the student will also develop a work ethic and learn self discipline. The society will also benefit from the involvement of students in extra activities because the child will grow up to be a cooperative and disciplined adult/ worker.",

You have to be on the student council instead!\", then the school would be taking away their freedom to choose.\n\nThey also might not have enough time to do it.\n\nIf they already have a full schedule, then what?\n\nDoes the school force them to take something out?\n\nAnd how do they enforce it?\n\nIf someone doesn't want to do an extracurricular activity, and realizes that forcing kids to do it is stupid, then how will the school make them?\n\nThey can't punish them.\n\nIt doesn't add up.\n\nStudents should be able to decide whether they do something like this or not, because America is built on freedom, and schools can't take that away.\n\nFurthermore, the students might not want to do it.\n\nIf they wanted to play a sport, there is only limited slots on a team.\n\nIf they fail to make the team, then what?\n\nAre they just told to pick another activity?\n\nAnd also, the school might not offer what a student wants.\n\nIf a student loved anime and wanted a club, but there wasn't one, then don't force them to do something they don't want to do.\n\nIf they do force kids to do it, they should at least ask them what they would like to do, and if they don't have that, then create it.\n\nAnd if they do force them to do something they don't like, someone could add a bad review on google.\n\nThen, parents might decide they don't want their kids going to school there.\n\nAnd if enough kids transfer, then the school might get shut down because they have no purpose to keep running.\n\nFinally, it takes away valuable time.\n\nLike I said in the first body paragraph, if they don't have enough time to do it, then what will the school do?\n\nThey can't force them to free up time, so the system is quite flawed.\n\nAlso, if a student has a pretty full schedule, and only has 1 free day, the school might take that away.\n\nA couple of days in the week is fine to have things to do, but if you have something every single day, and only one day in a week that you are free, that is a valuable day.\n\nStudents need some days to unwind.\n\nPlus, what if you had a lot of homework?\n\nA conversation might go down like this:\n\nThe teacher said \"Hey Richard, did you do your essay?\n\nI didn't ever get it from you.\"\n\nAnd then Richard said \"No, I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to finish it.\n\nSince the principal is making us do these extracurricular activities, I had to do a club, and I wasn't able to study for my massive quarter test in algebra and do my essay last night.\n\nI will try to get it to you today.\"\n\nThat would be horrible for students, and could result in lower grades.\n\nStudents should not be forced to do extracurricular activities.\n\nIt takes away freedom from them, they may not want to do it, and it could take away valuable time, too.\n\nI think that every person should be given a choice in what they do, and school or parents or whomever should not be allowed to choose for them.",

    Essay: "Do you thing a full time hard working student should have another activity piled on top of all of the other things we do? well it think no you should not have to do anything extra. Nobody should be forced or be expected to do something that does not benefit them self. You can't always please everyone by doing something extra. If you spend all your time doing things for your school you will have no tome for yourself. Some people will come and some people will go off and do their own stuff so there really is not a point in doing that if people just dont show up.\n\nHowever, some people will agree with doing an extra activity, some people will disagree because of the following reason, many teens play the \"mother\" or \"father\" role in the household. They provide the money by working after school and the cook and clean. If you add another activity when will they have the time to do any of that?\n\nIf you have aver cooked ant cleaned at the same time you will know how stressful it it and weather or not they like it. Just think about it, why would you add more stress to a teenagers life?\n\nIf any school in the world would make that a new rule I hope someone would stop it. I dont want to make it seem like its the worst thing in the world but I will say its probably not the best thing to add to a teens schedule. Maybe if it was a homework club that you could choose to go to and all of you teachers would be there to help you and help you get a better understanding on work and maybe your siblings could attend also to just get a taste of middle school or highschool is like. I think that schools should also offer something like a free block that students can visit other teachers during the school day.\n\nIn conclusion, I dont really agree with making kids do something outside of school. I would like to know the outcome if you dont participate in any out-of-school activities. It seems to cause too much trouble. If any school is considering on doing it maybe the the students advice and ask them if they think it is a good idea or take a vote. Maybe try it for a few months and find out if the school can enforce the discipline and how many people actually attend. If any school decides to do this just do a \"trial run\" to see how it works.",

Gives the students opportunities to become more responsible, make new friends, and be more excited to come to school. Students shouldn't have a choice to participate in extracurricular activities because it teaches them how to become an young adult.\n\nFirst, students would become more responsible.

Also make the school a friendly place where students want to come and see friends, play sports, and join clubs they would like.\n\nNext, student should want to do do more extracurricular things because its a great way to meet new friends.\n\nWhen the students make new friends they could do the extracurricular activities with them.

    Essay: "Many students participate in activities outside of school, youth groups, sports teams, clubs and lots more. Some schools that are fortunate to have enough funding for school activities, like clubs or sports teams, usually provide it for their students. Many times the students are provided these programs free of charge. Lots of students take the clubs and teams for granted, and dont realize how lucky they are to have so many activities for them to access. Schools provide all sorts of different clubs for all sorts of interest groups. Sometimes you can even form your own club. School-funded activities are usually very inclusive and invite and encourage everyone who is interested to come and try it out. I believe that it would be beneficial for every student to participate in an extracurricular because they help form a sense of belonging, and when students interact with others that share some of the same interests, they are more likely to form bonds and strengthen their social skills. In addition, they are a good use of time and can help kids stay out of trouble.\n\nWhen kids go straight home from school, many times they find that they have completed their homework and are bored with nothing to do. They might go sit on their couch eat food and watch television. Or they might make an unsafe decision about what to do,and end up doing something unlawful or harmful to themselves, such as smoking drugs or vandalizing public property. Extracurricular activities provide tons of clubs or teams that include lots of physical activity, like running, and playing a sport or game. Even if students are just walking, that's still a lot healthier than sitting on a couch, snacking on chips. Studies have proven that when kids who are in an extracurricular activity are at less risk of incorporating themselves with gangs. School activities are very helpful towards students who have lots of free time. They are beneficial for students health and make sure kids stay out of trouble by taking up extra time.\n\nSome students have a hard time finding a group of friends, and might not have the courage to make themselves vulnerable to people. School-provided activities invite students to go to clubs that focus on a common interest, like math, science, art, soccer, theater, film, or video games, and many more depending on the school. If students choose to attend club they can find friends based on common interests. They might meet someone and realize that they have a class with them. When students consistently attend a club they will get to know their peers and teacher or teachers there, which will create a friendly environment. Therefore forms a sense on belonging for the students there. Some clubs work on a group activity such as a film, play, or piece of artwork(etc.). Working together as a team can lead to feelings of accomplishment and pride. Students should be required to attend at least one extracurricular activity because they are more likely to make friends, and form a sense of belonging in that club, which is very healthy for teens especially.\n\nWhen students attend an activity, they have a chance to exercise their social skills, by communicating with others, which can help them become more successful with jobs, meetings, group work, and more. Students today spend lots of time on their phones, computers or other electronic devices. they communicate through snap chat, text, face time or calls. But many kids lack the social skills needed in as group environment. Extracurricular activities encourage students to talk and communicate with their peers in a group environment. Communication is very important for future jobs, meetings, and auditions. Being able to communicate and work in a team is a big trait that companies look for when they hire people. So building communication skills will benefit students in the long term and help them become successful individuals.\n\nI agree that every student should be required to take part in at least one extracurricular activity because more students would be using their time wisely and staying out of trouble, the clubs would build a sense of belonging for students, and help students build communication skills that will help them all throughout their lives.\n\nstudents will feel a welcoming environment in the club that they choose and will be happier knowing that they have made a few friends. Students will build success- bound skills of communication during clubs that will help them in high school and college. Extracurricular activities will take up uneccessery free time that students will spend doing productive activities. Students should be required to take a school funded activity because it will be emotionally, socially, and physically beneficial for them, and also because it's fun!",

    Essay: "I agree with decision because, students need to be in extracurricular activity's it helps them interact with other students or, people. Students who are in extracurricular activity's also help the school. If a student is in the student council they're representing their school by being a student body.\n\nExtracurricular activity's give students a chance to make friends and interact with their city or town. Playing sports is a good way to exercise and, can help the body in positive ways. Playing soccer helps you make your foot stronger when you kick the ball working your muscles. Playing football helps make you a stronger person because, when you get tackled you're working your muscles to make you stronger so you don't get tackled as easy before you started playing. Playing basketball helps a person work their arm muscles so it's easier to shoot the basketball. Playing baseball will also work your arm muscles so you can hit a home run.\n\nExtracurricular activity's such as community service helps the community by for example, giving to the homeless, giving to food donors, and trash pickup helps the economy and preserve our beautiful world. Being a yearbook designer is a nice way to help a school by taking pictures of the bright, beaming students and, giving information of the whole year. Being in a after school club is a good way to help interacting with people and working on whatever the club is that you're doing. Mindstorms club helps kids who are interested in robots and is a relaxed club that has no competitions but is a fun club to do if you're interested in robots and technology. Chess club is a good club because, Chess is a game of focus and you need to be very focused and, aware of what you and, your opponents doing because, one wrong move could cost you the game entirely.\n\nExtracurricular activity's help you understand why people like interacting with each other. Interacting with people is a everyday thing we have to do and, if nobody interacted with each other the world wouldn't be what it is today. Extracurricular activity's also help with controlling yourself and reaching peace with your mind and, body. I agree with this decision because, students need to be more active and, help their community by doing extracurricular activity's.",

    Essay: "Right when you get home you rush to your room to open your letter. You read \"we were happy you came out and put effort in but you have been cut from this team.\" You are defeated knowing you really wanted to play a sport but now you dont know how you will be able to do an extracurricular activity. I think we should not force students to do at least one extracurricular sport because a lot of students will be cut, many students will be stressed and not have time, and not everyone has the ability or equipment.\n\nI think that we shouldn't make every kid do an extracurricular activity because many students will be cut. If all kids have to do a activity after school a lot of kids will be trying out for sports. If theres a student who really want to play but gets cut because someone better who doesn't want to play gets to play wouldn't be fair. Also having so many students trying to play a sport or just having to expand teams would also be chaotic and difficult to manage. Therefore we should not make every student do a extracurricular activity after school.\n\nsecondly not all students like sports or band. There are many students who dont like after school activities or they already do one but not related to school. there are also kids who are not able to play sports or activities from being disabled or not able to walk. Even though kids could do a sport or activity doesn't mean they should. There are students who have to take care of their family and always have to do chores or dont have the money to buy themselves the equipment for the sport or activity. Also there are many students who do have to help their parents with finance reasons where it would be nearly impossible for them to add on an extracurricular activity.\n\nThis leads me to my last statement that some students dont have time to do a sport. like I said students sometimes have to be home always helping or having so much schoolwork they cant do a extra activity. Students now have close to twice as much work to get to a college than the 1900's. Kids have to bend over backwards always trying to keep up with their schoolwork. As a result it would be really hard for them to do a activity when they have so much already on their plate. Students would just be getting stressed after coming home from their after school activity when they have a lot of work waiting for them when they get home.\n\nIn conclusion I believe that they should not force students to do a extracurricular activity for these reasons. Many kids will be cut, not all kids can or have resources for it, and some students dont have time for it. For those reasons I think that it wouldn't be a great decision to make every student do one extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities can open up students to thousands of different opportunities; the amount of extracurricular activities are almost endless. A few of these activities could be: playing on a sports team, joining a club, or even being part of the student council. All three of these activities could be very beneficial, and impact your life tremendously. Students would be able to experience things they may not of ever known they had a interest in, or perhaps in the process of the activity they may form a fondness for that certain thing. The activities the student may participate in can also give the student a more neutral place to relax and just be a kid. This would help the student finish their homework, and forget about all the stress of their day. The idea of a student must participate in an extracurricular activities is an extraordinary idea because it would help students form a healthier lifestyle, meet new people, and there is a chance a student may perhaps gain a new interest.\n\nMost importantly, extracurricular activities would allow a student to make better life choices and become a better person in general. The main activity that could cause a change a students life is playing a sport. Playing sports grants the student a chance to be a part a team that will support them and help them make good choices, that will impact there life positively. Sports also help the student become more active, so this means the student will be healthier, and they may even preform better in school. Being more active can also lead to your personality and your mental health to increase. This can lead to a student being nicer to their peers, or other students at the school, getting better grades, having a better outlook on negative situations, and just all around living life to its fullest.\n\nIn addition to sports there are clubs. Clubs can also impact students, but they can also have an impact on the school. Clubs give the chance for students to meet new people that they might of never meet before in their regular school day. Students may meet a remarkable number of new friends when they join a club. There are a lot of good reasons that meeting new people is good, but her are only a few. The friends that they meet can have the same interests as them, which can lead to even more things they may want to do with their newly acquired friends. The new people a student may meet can also be good role model for the student ,and they can give the student good advice on how to handle problematic situations. It is always good to have a person that will try to help you succeed in life, rather than a person who tries to take you down the wrong path in life. Finally, a student will become more socially active, and hang out and do things with the new friends that they have gained. No one ever likes to be lonely, so clubs can give you a place to socialize and do great things with others.\n\nFurthermore, an extracurricular activity can also help a student find a new interest in what they are doing. A student may do something they are not comfortable with at first, but then there might be a hint of fun or comfortability in the new activity. It is always good to try new things because a student may never know if they will like it or not. An extracurricular activity that could open you up to something different could be, being a part of the student council. The student council would allow a student to do things outside of their comfort zone and experience new things. A student would be exposed to new people and new situations they may have never encountered before,for this could allow students to gain better people skills and be able to communicate with students and other people. Students may be uncomfortable with the whole process at first, but then they may form a likeness for it and the council may be the most exciting experience for them. This was only one example of an extracurricular activity that can help you find a new thing that can secretly interest you. Almost all extracurricular activities can help sprout a new intrest in you because they are all different, and they can respond to the personalities of a bunch of different people.\n\nIn conclusion, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can lead to a better, and more successful life, a more positive and helpful friend group, and they can help someone become interested in something they have never tried before. There are very little negatives involving activities that you do outside of school; this is because they are all meant to give students a fun and calming place to try new things. There is a extracurricular activity for everyone, so each student should participate in at least one. If every student participate in a extracurricular activity then the school would be a better place, and students would have a better personality, and there would be a greater atmosphere in the school.",

    Essay: "Is it a good idea to force students to participate in extracurricular activities? Extracurricular are set in place to allow students to expand on what they want for their future which should be optional. Being forced to do these could discourage students from what they want to be by having it forced upon them. Clubs and participating in yearbooks could help students make friends and build social skills. In my opinion extracurricular activities should be optional, expand more on student ideas and grades while also helping build social skills.\n\nExtracurricular activities should not be mandatory by any means because they are made to be optional. If any student was forced to do any extracurricular activity it could make that topic boring for them. Having mandatory sports for example could make that teams hype lower. Having students that do not want to be on yearbook on yearbook might make it turn not as expected. Extracurricular activities can help build a students understanding of a topic that they are interested in.\n\nThese activities could count toward extra credit if needed for lower grades and help them improve. This could help them for later in life with college. Extra activities could make the student want to help other students in what they want to do. Activities like sports could help students make money in the future if they are good at them. Extracurricular activities could help students make friends if they choose to help other students.\n\nHelping other students would be good at building teamwork for things like sports. Helping other students could make students better tutors. When students are better tutors they could possibly teach a younger generation as well. Social skills could help students apply for jobs and make themselves look better for better opportunities. Working with other people could help the student have a better understanding of what other people may be struggling with in a topic.\n\nAs explained extracurricular activities are nice thing to have for these reasons and my opinion is that they should be kept but not forced to be done. Activities are meant to be enjoyed not exploited by the higher staff of the school. Pushing students to do something could possibly be bad for their state of mind and personality. In the end do not make them do it but leave them as an option.",

    Essay: "A principle theorizing about a mandatory extracurricular activity is not a new one, but thousands and thousands of like minded people have thought it a good Idea. Should principles require out of school activities? Would this help students or simply serve as a means to increase their already demanding workload? I know that this would help with a variety of issues facing students today. Some of the benefits of and extracurricular activities are the ability of less popular or shy students to make more friends through a shared interest, the possibility of a sparked interest that would have otherwise gone unnoticed, and the ability for students to make real change to benefit themselves and their peers.\n\nMany students today have trouble making friends, and with the rise of cliques in schools it only gets progressively more difficult as the years go on. An extracurricular could make it far easier for new friendships to develop when they otherwise would not. A shared interest is a powerful tool to make connections with people and be the catalyst for a great friendship, and people with similar interests flocking to the same clubs or activities many new friendships are bound to be formed.\n\nIf students should join a club, an interest that would have gone undiscovered would rise to the surface potentially becoming a life long hobby or even career. Without these clubs to spark their interest who knows if they will discover their true passion in life. These activities would not only be a way to get someone excited about a topic but could actually be a way to use your talents at something you care about.\n\nStudents today feel as if their voice is not heard, they feel as if their parents and teachers don't care what they think about anything. That is a real issue, and if we ever wish to make the next generation the best, we must let their voices be heard and let them express their opinions. Clubs like a student council could be just the way to do that, getting something done and having tangible evidence that you have been heard and someone cared about it, like getting more basketballs in the gym or something similar. letting students make the lives of themselves as well as their peers would be a powerful way to give students confidence.\n\nSo with the ability to form new friendships, the chance to foster a new interest, and the possibility to make real change, yes I support the idea to require an extracurricular activity for students. Someone might be shy or not have many friends, but with these clubs, they could start new friendships and live a better life at school and at home, they could have an interest but not be able to express it, but the clubs could give them a chance to use their talents, and finally they might not feel heard, but the activities will help them feel like their voice matters. So the question should Principles mandate extracurricular activities is a simple one to answer, yes.",

One of the reasons why is so we can make more friends and be more comfortable aorund people. The reason why we need to have friends and be more comfortable around people is because friends are always a important part of a persons life. Comfort is also really important because most jobs involve people and if you're uncomfortable around people that could be a problem. One of my other reasons is because it helps you with communicaton. For example you can't always be right or get the last word. If one person feels sad and everyone else is happy it's unfair to have one person so we have to consider their feelings too. Therefore I feel like communication is very important because without it it's very hard to do group activities.

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities help prepare students for the real world, which is one of the major reasons students attend school. It should be mandatory for students to participate in extracurricular activities, because it would teach students time management, which is a life-skill needed in the real world. It also helps students discover their interests, and would encouraged young scholar to socialize with peers, who share common interests.\n\nFirstly, extracurricular activities cause students to manage their time better. Students may have to balance their time between their social lives, extracurricular activities, the time they spend with family, school work, etc. Time management is essential for a successful live. For example, an individual is very intelligent, however, he/she starts their homework at a late hour, and does not have time to study for their mid-terms. As a result, that individual is very tired in the morning, and does not do as well as he/she could of on the test. Extracurricular activities would force students to manage their time better, by adding an extra layer of responsibility.\n\nIn addition, extracurricular activities would encourage students to socialize with peers that share common interest. With a large amount of stress that is put on young scholars, it is important for them to talk with individuals who are in the same position. Extracurricular actives would allow students to obtain that opportunity. Nevertheless, students can also learn from others, such as, their peers, mentors, and teachers. For example, an individual may be interested in sports. He/she has the opportunity to communicate with peers that also enjoy sports.\n\nFurthermore, extracurricular activities aid students in discovering interests. For example, a young scholar participates in the school newspaper, that student may be interested in a profession where writing is involved, or maybe a student joins the school debate team, that student may enjoy a career in law. It is important for students to have an option when it comes to hobbies or interests, in order to be more successful. Extracurricular activities would provide that option. Extracurricular activities make it easier for students to find what they enjoy the most. This is an extremely important factor of school. A student may believe they enjoy a certain class, but when they join the class, they realize it is not for them. Extracurricular activities provide many doorways, in which students can enter or exit whenever they want.\n\nIn conclusion, making extracurricular activities mandatory would force students to manage their time better, expose students to peers that share common interests, and help young scholars discover their interests. Extracurricular activities are a part of the school experience, so students should jump on the bandwagon and discover what they enjoy.",

    Essay: "Do you want to be forced to play a sport, work in the yearbook, or be in the student council? Our principal has decided that you have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular means out of school so that automatically puts many roles in play. Since you cannot say no to the principal, it means you have no choice but to participate in one. Students should not have to do an extracurricular activity because their family might not have enough money to support one, there can be transportation issues, and students would have less time to complete their daily expectations.\n\nOne reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is that their family might not have enough money to financially support one. That means that you are adding to the fact that there are already money struggles. Most extracurricular activities come with some sort of cost which means adding an extracurricular activity to the bill would likely cause stress. Unless the school is willing to pay for each persons activity, the principal should not be allowed to force it upon them to complete a sport or whatever they choose. If the principal is planning on requiring at least one activity to be done per student throughout the whole school year and not just one quarter or semester, that would add even more cost that the parents have to take out of their paycheck.\n\nAnother reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is because their family might not be able to take them everyday. Their guardians have to take time out of their own day to drive their kid to a place that might be a far distance from their home. It also might cause their parents to have to leave work early or hire someone to drive them, both affecting their paycheck. The students could carpool but there's a big chance that you won't know anyone doing the same activity as you. No matter what, whoever is driving you will still have to pay for gas. Since the principal is requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity they should offer transportation, but since they are not it really leaves you no choice but to figure it out on your own.\n\nA third reason why students should not be forced to do an extracurricular activity is that they will have a lot less time for their daily expectations. Students often receive homework everyday and have chores they need to complete. They also have to spend time with their family, eat dinner, and they might have plans with their friends. The activity they have to do will most likely conflict with at least one of those things. It would be a shame that their family would have to change their schedule in order for it to work out with the students' activity. The activity would most likely last longer than an hour which pulls a big chunk of time away from them being able to do their homework, chores, and eat. It could risk students falling behind in school and cause extreme stress. The students may also drift from their friends and family and their health can decline from lack of sleep and nutrition.\n\nThese are just three reasons explaining how forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity can be harmful financially, health wise, and many other ways. Being forced to do a sport or something of the sort can cause a lot of unessecary stress at such a young age. It should be a students choice if he or she wants to do an extracurricular activity, but it should not be forced.",

An example was this year in 8th grade I had a after school appointment with my science teacher but I also had a really important basketball game I told my teacher I couldn't make it and i'll make it up and she was fine with it so I went to the game.\n\nIn conclusion I disagree with the principal because nobody should have to do something they don't wanna do. I disagree with the decision because they might have homework, they wanna get home to be with there family, and they might have a sports practice or game.",

It can also lead to many positive things and could make a big change to students. It allows students to meet new people they may never would interact with. And it enables students to be able to learn new things they may haven't learned yet. Also it lets students be able to learn great skills that they may need in life. Another thing is that students can find a new hobby they may never thought they would like. So I agree that making students do a extracurricular activity it can lead to great things by letting students find new hobbies or things they like to do, learning important skills, and meeting new people.\n\nMany people have many hobbies or things they like to do. And by making students do a extracurricular activity it can help students find new things they like to do. Sports are a fun and enjoyable activity many students do and love. And by making students do a extracurricular activity, it can help students find a sport they really enjoy that they didn't think they would like.

Many people are fascinated by art and many students may not think they like it, but if students have to do a extracurricular activity it may lead to some finding a love for art.

    Essay: "I believe that all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity could actually very well help students. Though there clearly is a bad side to taking up your time with a \"forced\" activity, that isn't always the case. Students tend to complain whenever they're forced to do \"useless\" things that aren't even necessary, but they also don't look to see why their teachers or principal makes the decision they make. Us students always seem to think of extra work and extracurricular activities as something that won't ever help us in life. So the students will get fustrated by the principal making them do an extracurricular activity because they're \"useless\" activities, but they can actually end up making long-lasting friends, strengthen a variety of skills to help get them into different things, and they could find a new fantastic hobby that they love-depending on what they join and try out for.\n\nMany students have the hardest time to find that one good friend group that is nice to them and enjoys what they enjoy, but they never seem to try and figure out how to find that right group. Being in at least one extracurricular activity could actually seriously help many troubled students find those people that make them happy. If you join a sports team you could end up becoming very close with your team and then form a tight-knit friend group that you've longed to have. It also doesn't hurt to join more than one club, because you never know what amazing people you'll find in those clubs. You also can pick whatever team or club you want to join, so students don't have to pick something they don't like and have a terrible time being in what they joined. The students have a wonderful opportunity to pick their choice of club or team and make some new friends.\n\nFor the older students, or possibly even younger students, joining that team or club can help you get into your dream college. Lots of students already join their school sports team or clubs to help them strengthen that area of skill so they can get really good at that set of skills and get into that dream thing they've longed for. If you like to swim then go tryout for your school swim team, because maybe you'll end up growing as a swimmer and getting a scholarship from your dream school. If you're not an athlete, no worries! There are so many clubs, such as debate club, art club, film club, and even homework club. You can get help to become a better artist, filmer, or whatever you desire! Extracurricular activities don't just have to be a waste of time, so you should go join that club or team and become amazing at that area of skill.\n\nAs I had said before, you have a choice of a wide variety of clubs and school teams that you can join, so why not try out a bunch because you're bound to end up really liking one of them. Schools have so many options to choose from, yet students end up ignoring the clubs and teams because they thing they're a waste of time and boring. If students ended up trying out some clubs or teams they could seriously realize that maybe they enjoy that team, or maybe they're actually a really good writer and want to pursue in writing. I can't stress enough how so many students now a day are sitting around at their house complaining how bored they are because they have nothing to do and they're not good at anything. All those students most likely haven't tried out any teams or clubs to actually try and see if they enjoy it or have the skills for it. It's always your choice to join that club or team, or it's your choice to sit around and complain about that painful and dreaded boredom.\n\nNow there are bad sides to taking up your time in other activities, because you might not have as much free time, but in the end students should seriously open their eyes and see the good that these opportunities at school aren't as bad as they say. I really mean it when I say that you'll find those friends that make school worth coming to, because those friends you find in clubs, teams, and musicals, they're like whole second family. And you'll never know your skills, strengths, and abilities until you end up taking that risk and trying out new things. Once you find those strengths and skills, you'll end up realizing how rare it was that you took that risk to go along with your principal, because now you've found new friends, new incredible hobbies, and possibly a path to your dream school. So yes, maybe you'll loose some precious relaxing free time, but you'll gain a lifetime of rare skills and friends.",

    Essay: "I agree that we should have to be involved in an extracurricular activity because we need to take a break from school, get involved and try new things, and so we can meet new people and develop social skills. When we are involved in something more than just school and we can develop good relationships. We also just need time just to step aside from school and do something we enjoy.\n\nFirst Reason why I agree that we should be required to do and extracurricular activity, is that sometimes we need a break from school and having to do work. I know that some extracurricular activities involve school, but it's not like you're doing worksheets for an actual class. I believe that we should have an outlet. An outlet is something that helps you calm down and relax. We should have an outlet that we choose, it should be something fun, something that we like to do, and something that we won't get to stressed about. When I'm doing my extracurricular activity I feel so relieved and stress free, because I don't have to worry about any grades or school work, I can just focus on something that I like and enjoy doing. Everyone needs to have that feeling, that outlet.\n\nThe next reason why I agree is because we need to get involved in something and try something new. What I mean by getting involved in an extracurricular activity, is get involved because you what to do it, not because maybe your friends are doing it or your parents want you to do a certain sport, do it because it involves your interest and what you want to do. If you are not sure what your interest are, then try something new that sounds appealing to you. They're a lot of extracurricular activities out there that you may like. Maybe you think that a sport is right for you, and that's all you do, but you might not know that your a really good artist, because you haven't tried it so you wouldn't know.\n\nMy last reason why I agree is that you can meet new people and develop social skills. I think meeting new people is important because you need to have some people that you can count on and that can help you through something. You never know when you could meet your best friend for life. Also if you try something new and you meet new people, you develop social skills. Examples of developing social skills are like how you go up to someone and introduce yourself, or how to include someone in your conversations.\n\nTaking a break from school, getting involved and trying new things, and meeting new people are the reasons why I agree with having every student be involved in an extracurricular activity. When you have something else than just school, you look forward to that one thing that you like doing, with new people and friends, and something that you really enjoy. That's why I think you should Agree with all students should be required to do an extracurricular activity. Don't you agree?",

    Essay: "How do extracurricular activities make you feel when you are in one? For me they make me feel happy and good about myself. It is a chance for me to interact with people that have one or more of the same interests as me.\n\nIf my principal was to make joining an extracurricular activity mandatory I would love that. It would give others a little nudge to join a team or be part of a group doing something they enjoy. Extracurricular activities provide an opportunity to make new friends with same interests as you, contribute to your school and or get you active.\n\nIn elementary school, at Generic_School, there was a club called Green Team. This club center was building a garden for the school to use and making sure that Generic_School is as green as can be. My mom had originally forced me to be in this club (like the principal is doing now) to learn more about gardening. At first, I did not really care for what we were doing with the T-Shirt design, the research on flowers and vegetables, the measurements for the garden and some other things. Then we started talking about a compost maker and how it works. Learning the science behind it got me intrigued in gardening and I looked at it a different way, my way. Being forced to do something isn't all that bad because who knows you might end up enjoying it. When the club ended I hadn't just been part of a group doing something I like, I had made the school a better place.\n\nA couple years after we moved here my dad made me retry lacrosse. It was Fourth grade and we moved here in second. I didn't want to do it because my experience with it on Long Island ruined it for me. He wanted me to try again because he knew I liked the sport lacrosse, just that for me to get back into the swing of things I would need a push. I went to Western Loudoun Lacrosse tryouts and was put on a team. I wasn't the best and was probably really close to being the worst, but I played the whole season. It is a good thing I didn't quit because if I had I wouldn't be friends with one of my best friends today. Now me and him do a lot of things together and I still play lacrosse.\n\nSome kids at school just try to get through the day to just go home and play video games till they fall asleep. The principal forcing us to get active and join a club or team is what these kids need. For starters colleges don't just look at your grades and tests scores, they look at what you do outside of school too. Those kids who don't want to put themselves out there because they are too scared of failure or humiliation need a little push to get them to do something they love and is good for them too. Being required to join an extracurricular activity is a good thing to happen and should.\n\nBeing required to do an extracurricular activity has many benefits such as contributing to you school, making new friends with similar or same interests and becoming active or increasing your activity. You are just required to do one and you get to choose. You are not being forced to do an extracurricular activity you dislike. It is just one activity that you might like.",

    Essay: "Did you know that being forced to do very unnecessary things for no reason can give you cancer. This should be the end of my essay, but I guess cancer isn't reason enough for the Department of Education or whoever is grading this thing so here we go. I believe thats students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because the school might not provide anything that interests them, they might need the time for other important things they have to do, and the principal shouldn't get to decide what you have to do outside of school and in your free time.\n\nMy first reason, besides cancer, would be the possibility that students might not find anything that they like or that peeks their interest in the schools extracurricular program. At Generic_Name, there are a lot of extracurricular activities for children to participate in, and most kids can find something that they like, key word being most. Some of the kids at Generic_Name have absolutely no interest what so ever in staying after school. Whether that may be because they dont like the activities, or if it's because somebody they don't like is in one of the only activities that they like to do, it still wouldn't be fair to them if they were forced to participate in these shenanigans for no apparent reason. And if people who don't want to participate are being forced to participate, they aren't going to care much at all for the activity, and so they aren't going to try, that in turn slows the whole operation down, which ruins it for the kids who actually do want to participate. All of it just would be unfair to a lot of people, so we shouldn't do it.\n\nThe Second reason I have is the fact that a lot of people need, and use the time they have after school to do very necessary stuff. Carrying for family members, doing chores, studying, and going to doctor appointments are only a handful of the things that many students have to do directly after school ends. Most of the students' worries aren't about being bored, it's about having enough time to do all the things you have to do, and taking away a large fraction of that time isn't exactly what you would smart. Now, imagine some eighth grader that is really struggling with math, he's bending over backwards trying to understand what the mixture of all these numbers and letters mean, he's tried to ask a teacher, but he just doesn't get the way she explains it. He tried asking his friends for help, but they don't know how to explain it either. He knows exactly who could help him, his mom. But he can't get help from his mom about all these things he has been taught through out the year, and the SOL is in a week. If only he didn't have to do all of that unnecessary work and ... Oh! would you look at that, now he has cancer. It's not like the entirety of our after school time is spent fooling around and selling drugs, we only do that half of the time.\n\nI also understand that this idea isn't entirely fraud. It would have some benefits such as keeping kids that might get into trouble outside of school, busy inside of school, it could also build a sense of unity between the students and the school. But the way I see it, the cons very much outweigh the pros in this situation. which leads me to my final reason for why this is dumb, why should the principal get to decide what I get and don't get to do outside of school, and outside, of school hours. I am pretty sure the principal has neither the right nor the power to enforce such a thing. Me and my family should be the only ones deciding what I should or shouldn't do with my free time. Plus, it is highly unlikely that this would pass if our principal tried to turn this into a rule, so why am I even writing this.\n\nI genuinely think that this a very stupid idea because of the fact the it will help or not affect a select group of students that are completely free after school, don't mind being in school for two more hours, or already stay after school everyday. So, you, yes you, I want you to march over to the principal's office spin his chair around and tell him he's a bad bad boy.",

    Essay: "Have you ever wanted to join a school club? Too bad if you said no because you dont get a choice! The Principal's plan is flawed and quite simply wont work. It is riddled with issues.\n\nThe main reason it will fail is because it's taking away free choice. As a result, teens will do what teens are sterotypically known to do and rebel. Many students will probably intentionally not join clubs. The majority of students enjoy going home after school and they will be angered by this plan.\n\nThere would not be enough options of activities for people to join. Everyone has different interests and some people would be forced to join clubs they don't like or even want to be in. Also, clubs might fill up faster because everyone has to join something. A kid who really likes robots and is enthusiastic about joining robotics club could be unable to join because it's full with kids who don't even care about robots.\n\nMany students do extracurricular activities but not through school. For example, stuff such as Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts. So kids could do lots of activities outside of school and be forced to do something that takes away what little of their free time remains. The school based activity could even conflict with a student's other activities.\n\nSchool clubs are a very good way to meet new friends, have fun, and learn. School clubs can even help you find your passion. However, they should be joined on one's own terms.\n\nIn summary, schools should not dictate a student's after school life. Although the principal probably has good intentions his plan could have some consequences. So, for the sake of our our free will and free time oppose the plan.",

For example sports,work on the school year book,or serve for student council do i agree or disagree with this argument.\n\nFirst off I would like to start off by saying, the principal might just want his students to have more than education. The principal just wants to have a little more fun in school instead of just sitting in side day doing boring classwork. So i should ask this, have you ever been in school and you are bored out of your mind? Well that is exactly why this principal is doing this for his students in his school.\n\nSecondly just let me back \"up\"! When your bored at your house what do you do? Well most of you would say um i play Fortnite or I play my Xbox or GTA 5 something like that. But when your at school your like please just get me out of here its so boring! So now is when im going to say that is why this school principals doing this for his student's because he dose not want his students to get bored.\n\nThirdly when a student gets bored they will do anything possible to not be bored. So thats what leads in to timeout slips and then it starts disrupting the class and it also stops the students from learning. So this is another reason why this principle doing this for his students. hen it gets so bad that it stops the others from learning you know its time to do something bout that. Like even some teachers have board games in their classrooms.\n\nFourthly that is why their are after school sports such as football,resulting,basketball,baseball,soccer,and even volleyball.

    Essay: "Students who struggle in school find it to be exhausting or even stressful, but participating in extracurricular activities may change their mind. Educating students may set them up for success in the future but can also put them at a worrisome situation to finish work on time and get projects done. Students who ask questions and seek for help may be overwhelmed and have trouble understanding the concept, in this situation students need to take their mind off this and do something to relieve them of their troubles. Extracurricular activities can impact students by relieving their stress, improving a more positive mindset, and finally having a chance to make new friends.\n\nSchool educates students about subjects that may be useful to have later in their lives, while this can be helpful it can also be stressful. Being in an extracurricular activity such as soccer club may gives students an opportunity to have fun and play with their friends, by doing this it can be enjoyable and take away stress from school. Although school is overwhelming sometimes, extracurricular activities make students embrace an opportunity that takes away all stress and helps them focus on exciting activities. By relieving stress the students will feel that they can achieve all the work given to them, this will boost their confidence knowing they can do anything.\n\nSometimes students might give up on their confidence because of all the work they have to get done. An extracurricular activity such as working on the yearbook can help students focus on an activity that helps them believe they are capable of achieving anything. Building confidence, having a better self esteem, and believing in yourself, are all important steps to having a more positive mindset, this impacts students because it helps students get their work done and doesn't have them worry about stressing out. A positive and confident mindset is one of the most important steps to achieve future goals, by being more confident anything can be accomplished.\n\nThe final reason why participating in an extracurricular activity is there will be plenty of people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. Beside all the fun and activities to do in different clubs there will also be people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. By making new friends it will improve one's mindset socially and is another way to deal with stress because when having new friends it can make someone feel happy and excited. Dealing with stress isn't an easy task, but a way to being happier is to make new friends.\n\nSchool can be stressful sometimes, but with extracurricular activities the amount of stress should be decreased. Extracurricular activities such as sports clubs, working on the year book, or even serving on student council are all opportunities for students to direct their focus on having fun instead of being overwhelmed by all the work. Being positive, relieving stress, and making new friends are all effective ways to not be overwhelmed in school, instead students should embrace going to school because of all the opportunities given.",

I lift my leg and shoot and my ball hits the net within second. The crowd cheering my teammates gathered around me. We just won the first championship game for Generic_School. This is commonly known as extracurricular activities that are offered and put together by the schools. We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities.\n\nOne of the reasons we should have these activities for students is because they can improve social skills. For example if you were running down the court and your teammate on the other side you can communicate to them \"Pass I'm open!\". According to activitesforstudents. org having children and students be on a team can improve many things teamwork abilities,social skills, along with confidence. But some people argue that having these teams and a type of competitiveness which can cause kids to be rude and be unkind to the other teammates who they think is \"not good enough\". A true story from americanantibullysociety. org. about a young boy who was home schooled and very shy. He later came to public school where he sat alone at lunch and didnt talk to anyone. A few months later he joined the yearbook staff. He became very social and everyone wanted to be his friend. He later realized that having these connections at school is a necessity. This really puts in perspective why we should have extracurricular activities.\n\nAnother reason that we should have this rule is because it can help you become more involved with the school system. An article titled \"Children need extracurricular activities!\" claims that doing these activities can decrease the number of children and teens led into mental problems or social skills. A website called USAschools. com stated that in just the last year the number of kids who arent in activities at school end up being indoors and isolating themselves which could lead to no friends and could lead to larger more severe problems. Having these activities will attract more students to join new schools if they have good sport teams or any of there other interests.\n\nSome people argue that school should only be for academics. There wrong because although schools are for learning new concepts in math,science, civics and more doesnt mean students should not have the opportunity to join a yearbook staff or a sports team. on the other hand, maybe we shouldnt have these activities because the schools already put enough money into teaching kids do we need to spend more money on this activities?\n\nI think that we should have this rule because these activities help in so many ways not just inside of school but outside to!

Just because they don't like running doesn't mean anything sports aren't the only extracurricular activity there and if they aren't good at it doesn't mean at least trying is going to kill them or they can another club or maybe make one up with their friends so they can be in that club but they are gonna have to think hard and make sure the principal agrees with their club. See some people might say it's boring well that's only true when you think that and don't try but when you feel welcomed and try it'll be fun you might even make some new friends you never know. Extracurricular activities aren't just for being good at it they are for having fun and you might become famous or become history thanks to this club you joined. These clubs can change you life but it takes effort and not just do it and done no it takes time and a lot of learning remember this quote \"All things are difficult before they are easy.\" So every time you have a difficult time trying to solve something try to do it step by step or in other words \"In life their is never an elevator always take the steps.\"\n\nI hope after reading all this you agreed with me if you already did great but if you didn't I hope you do now and if you still don't agree then your loss.",

    Essay: "Splash! The bucket of paint hits the canvas as soon the extra class starts. I would like to agree with the decision of an extra class for all students to at least participate in one extra activity. An example for an extra class is like to design in the yearbook,learning art,and making new friends.\n\nFirst of all,designing in the yearbook for the whole school to see would be an outstanding work of art. Helping out for the yearbook could be fun in many ways and taking lovely photos of people as they have fun as well. Doing the yearbook means that the students can also cast a vote on the colors and the font on the yearbook. One of the most important part of the yearbook is the theme, like for spring and summer or even the school mascot.\n\nSecondly, learning art is also fun to have for an extra class and getting to experience a new feeling to learn more about the activity. Having art class could interest other students to join or having art cast their future job. Learning for an extra class can improve on a students skill or there love for art, and to give the students an opportunity to show off their talents for the whole school to see one day.\n\nThird of all, having a new class to go to could help out some students to make new friends and build there trust more. Team bonding is also a way to make new friends and help each other out to learn from each other. Having new friends can also lead into a group project, and build up the trust that students can make. Students can have similar skills, like to paint in the same or close style, and may also think the same idea as one another student has.\n\nLastly, having an extra event for students is a fantastic idea and making school a bit more exciting to go, giving the students an opportunity to choose what they are going to be in the future. Getting a new generation in the world would save a lot of people and change the future one day.",

    Essay: "Do you think kids should be forced to do extracurricular activities? No, I disagree with kids being forced to do extracurricular activities. Kids shouldn't be forced to do after school activities just because the principle wants them to. Kids should have the option of saying if they are going to or not. You have to see if the students are able to go without any obstacles or even if they want to do extra circular activities. There are many kids where there are issues to get to places issues of even getting permission.\n\nFirst, kids come to school to learn and parents pick them up but some don't because they have to work or run errands, so the kids take the bus. Sometimes there is not a bus after school or in a regular sport. A lot of the times you need a parent or guardian to pick the student up. Picking kids up right after work can be stressful because of traffic and sometimes parents aren't even home with extracurricular actives are over. So it would be very difficult for parents and kids to go and not be able to get picked up. It would also be scary for the child, knowing that you don't know how you are going to get home. Why make it stressful for both people when you can have a choice to go.\n\nNext, there are students who have illness, who don't have a choice to go or not. You can't force someone who is sick to do extracurricular activities. Forcing someone who has a disease or syndrome shouldn't be forced to do something that could make there condition worse then it already is. What if a student has something they don't know much about yet but they know something is wrong. You force them to be in the extracurricular activities and they get some type of bacteria or run and make everything in their system worse.\n\nLastly, forcing kids to do something has no impact on how they are going to feel about what is going on. Forcing kids to do things makes them want to do it less and dread what they are doing or going through. Such as forcing kids to do extracurricular activities is just making them not want to come because you can't let them pick on their own if they want to come or not. You should have kids have their say. Letting them like you and know what you are planning on doing could impact this situation a lot with just letting them have their own option.\n\nUnderstanding now why kids shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities, the principle should not force these kids to do extracurricular activities. They should let the kids decide if they want to, they should figure out if their are any issues if they want to do it, and they should know if they are committed without being told to do it.",

    Essay: "Have you ever felt the excitement of being with your friends after school and doing something that you all love? Extracurricular activities include chess, soccer, basketball, and choir. There are an endless amount of after school activities, so everyone can have something to do. I agree with the fact that everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity because they help one to make new friends, they are lots of fun, and they help make great learning experiences.\n\nWhen one comes to a new school, not knowing anyone can be a struggle. Extracurricular activities can help create a friend group for you. Extracurricular activities only happen around once a week, so you can spend that time with your friends. Many people only have a little friend group that they like to hang around, and extracurricular activities help expose people to new friends. Boosting your friend group can also lead to a boost in your self confidence around others. This is a reason that more people should be involved in extracurricular activities.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a lot of fun. You get to hang out with your friends while doing what you love. There are such a variety of activities that you can do whatever you want without worrying that there isn't something for you. Besides, if your friends are doing an activity with you, it will probably be fun anyways. Extracurricular activities can help you find the fun things there are in high school and college.\n\nExtracurricular activities are a great learning experience. They are amazing because they can make your day seem more fulfilling than it already was. Extracurricular activities can help you create more skills than you already have because they help you to develop more and more skills that will benefit you later in life. More and more colleges are looking for people to play sports for them. Extracurricular activities can help to get you into college for a lower cost. This is my final reason why extracurricular activities are a great idea.\n\nEveryone should participate in an extracurricular activity because they help you make friends, they are a lot of fun, and they create great learning experiences. Everyone will have something for them to do after school because there are so many options. Extracurricular activities help you get your mind stay relaxed. From soccer to being in the musical there are so many options for extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "Students are going home everyday having nothing to do, therefore some of them turn to hang out with the wrong crowd, with the wrong people. Some turn to drugs, while others turn to alcohol. If only they had something to do after school, then they wouldn't do things like drugs and alcohol. That is why every student must participate in an extracurricular activity. While every student should do an extracurricular activity, the school has to provide multiple after school activities so that students have options to pick from. All students should participate in extracurricular activities because it gives students the feel of school pride when their school goes into a competition, it takes up time in a students day so they don't have to go do drugs and alcohol, and it surrounds a students with a good environment.\n\nWhen students are involved in school, they participate in more school events like football games, school parties, and theater productions. Not only are the students more involved, but their friends are too. Most kids don't like to go to school events by themselves, so they bring a friend. If every student brings at least one friend, then the amount of people that goes to the events doubles. Just last year I was on my middle school basketball team and we were playing a team that we were rivals with. I wanted my friends to see and watch me play, so I brought at least twenty people to the game. When people are involved in something, they want their friends to see what they have done, and they want to be praised. The students may not enjoy being forced to stay after school at first, but they will soon learn to love it.\n\nSome students go home to an empty house, for their parents come home late at night because they are working. With nothing to do they start to watch shows and movies, but they get bored and tired of watching TV shows after a while. When somebody is bored, they look for anything to cure their boredom. Some turn to friends, while others turn to drugs and alcohol. If they drink enough, they get drunk and do things without knowing they did it. This kills time a lot faster than sitting around doing nothing all day. Drugs can be worse because the consequences can be a lot more serious. Some consequences are liver failure and death. Both are also very expensive and addictive, so it makes the people taking it want to take one more dose, drink one more cup, until they no longer have any money because they spent it all on drugs and alcohol. Their school could have prevented all of this if the student just stayed after school for a little longer. If the students stayed after school for the yearbook committee, they would not have the time to be bored because they would be too busy creating a yearbook for the whole school to see. When students stay after school for extracurricular activities they do not need to turn to drugs because they are busy at school. The school also fills the students with a good environment, which leads me to my next topic.\n\nA child acts and does things similar to the people they hang out with. If their friends are people that do a lot of community services and are nice people, the child will turn out to be nice too. This does not just apply to children, but it applies to everybody. Sometimes a good environment can be hard to find, but what better place sets a good environment than a school. A school has teachers that are willing to support their students and give them good guidance. Whenever I have a question with friends or anything, I have this one teacher that I know I can trust. This teacher helps and guides me with whatever my problem is. Everybody can find that one teacher they can trust if they joined an extracurricular activity. They could bond and connect with the teacher that is helping out at the activity, and they could find a good influence similar to the one I have.\n\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity helps and benefits students in many ways, and when students are ever looking for something to do, they don't have to turn to drugs, they could turn to after school activities which gives them a good and positive learning environment and it gives students the urge to participate and attend school games and parties. School may not be a students favorite place to be, but it provides students with a safe place that can have fun activities like soccer club or basketball club. Some students might complain about the new policy, but once they change their mindset, they will learn to love and enjoy the new rule. Not only are they staying in a safe environment, they are also hanging out with their friends outside of school hours. This time would also be a great time for students with no friends to take a chance and try to make some. Since extracurricular activities are fun and it provides a good and safe environment, making it mandatory it something I agree with and I think is right.",

    Essay: "Generic_Name\n\nGeneric_Name\n\nEnglish 8 Honors 4/11/2020\n\nStudents Should Participate in Extracurricular Activities\n\nI agree that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity for a couple of reasons. One reason being that if students choose to do a sport then they will become more healthy. Another reason being that some extracurricular's include math clubs which will help stretch students minds. Lastly I believe that students should have to do at least one extracurricular because it will leave less time for things such as video games. Those are the reasons why I believe every student should have participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nThere are many extracurricular choices people can choose from. One of those options being sports. Sports allow children to be more healthy and provide them with the opportunity for a better social life. If students have to participate in at least one extracurricular then they might pick a sport. This sport will allow them to have more physical activity which will in turn make them a healthier person. It might also allow them to have a better social life especially if they are on a team.\n\nAnother example of an extracurricular choice that students could pick from could be a math club. These clubs are designed to stretch students minds and give them better math skills. If students pick a club like a math club they will get many opportunities to stretch their minds. While also practicing important math skills. Just like sports clubs might also provide an opportunities for a social life.\n\nChildren now a days go home and go straight to playing video games for hours. It is proven that these games are not good for their minds and they should be doing something else like an extracurricular. Having to do an extracurricular activity will eat up the time that kids will have to play video games and instead put their time towards something more useful.\n\nIn conclusion I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will have the ability to become more healthy. They will have more opportunities to stretch there minds. Plus it will leave less time for other things such as video games. That is why I believe students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "I disagree with the principle on this decision, to make every student do an extracurricular activity because of three main points, the first being a student may have an activity that doesn't count as an extracurricular activity and adding the extracurricular activity would interfere with their schedules, the second point is students have lots of homework already. It may already be hard to keep up with school work for some students, and adding more work for them to do may make their grade drop and may add more stress to their lives. The third and finial point I'm going to make is, if you force students into extracurricular activities that they may not enjoy doing the amount effort they would put in will be low.\n\nTo elaborate on my first point, lets imagine you are a student and you had to go to school, then head to a job for a few hours then back to your house where you have to make dinner for you're whole family. After dinner you start your homework, every weekday that is your schedule. Then the principle make you start a extracurricular activity which mess up your whole schedule adding more stress and more things you need to do into your life.\n\nAdding to my second point, If a student is already struggling in school and already has lots of stress to deal with. Then making the student add an extra curricular activity may not be the best course of action because it will only add extra stress to their lives. This may make their grades drop which will only add more stress to their already extremely stressful lives.\n\nThe final point is, if we force students to get an extracurricular activities that they didn't want to do. They would get bored of those extracurricular activities, and since we are forcing them to do those activities they will just lower the amount of effort they put into those activities, and making the school look like it bad because the students would have poor work.\n\nInstead of forcing students into extracurricular activities, a better solution would be to encourage students to join in on some extracurricular activities. Then let them choose if they want to join any extracurricular activities on their own, because if we force all students to do extracurricular activities no matter what no one will benefit. I believe that if we let them choose if they want to join in extracurricular actives. They will be more inspired and will produce better work overall.\n\nIn collusion, I disagree with the principle on his decision, and believe that we should encourage students to join not just to forcing them into a extracurricular activity, because students will we more inspired to do the work and produce better work if they got to choose, than if they didn't get to choose.",

    Essay: "Have you ever been bored by the dull contents of school? Schools are normally the same everyday, which can cause one to feel as if their life is on repeat. It can feel droning and never-ending with each passing day. More often than not, children need something to break up the repetitive cycle of everyday school. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they bring out one's talents, help one to make real friends, and give students something to look forward to.\n\nFirst off, extracurricular activities can help bring out a student's talents. School is a \"one size fits all\" kind of approach, and most students don't always fit in the mold. Each kid finds interest in a different thing or skill. For instance, I took a painting class when I was in the 3rd grade. Painting is now something I do, almost daily, for relaxation and fun. Another example is, my friend Generic_Name started playing soccer when she was in kindergarten. Since then, she has become the captain of an amazing team that made it to nationals last year. Soccer is her passion and she has grown into a great player.\n\nSecond, extracurricular activities help kids make new friends. They \"funnel\" students into separate interest groups making it easier to create conversations. Kids are also able to make connections through this shared topic of interest. For instance, I play field hockey and I have to try out to make a team. At my last tryout, a seemingly nice girl approached me and asked how long I had been playing for. She started a simple conversation with a topic that we both love, and made a connection between the two of us. Another example is, my cousin plays softball and was invited to a sleep away camp. At first, she was anxious about not having anyone to talk to. After that weekend away, she came back she told me all about her new friends that she had met through this camp, doing something they all enjoy.\n\nLastly, extracurricular activities give students something to look forward to. School is generally not an event that students look forward to in a positive manner. Extracurricular activities can be looked forward to with a smile due to the fact that it is participated in because of the student's interests. For example, I look forward to field hockey. I love going to practices to see my friends and going to \"away\" tournaments to play with teams from everywhere. Another instance is, my little sister and cross fit. My sister recently started cross fit and she loves it. Every Wednesday, she goes and sees all of her friends and comes home with the biggest smile. On Tuesday nights she excitedly talks with my mom saying things like, \"We have to get there on time tomorrow, I almost missed the warm ups.\"\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities are beneficial to students in many different ways. Students can develop life long talents and passions as well as life long friends that share your interests. These activities can also be looked at like a special event to liven up one's day to day life. Extracurricular activities are interesting and still maintain the ability to brighten up any average school day.",

    Essay: "Have you ever wanted to learn to take photos? maybe get a taste of managing a community? How about building a hovercraft with wood and shower curtains? Well then you should sign up for a club! extracurricular activities or clubs are programs sponsored by a set of teachers that allow students to experiment and try new things and experiences that you can't normally take a class for. I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory for all students.\n\nFirst of all, you can get insight on what you might want your career to be. For example, taking a class on CPR, basic first aid, or how to respond to an emergency might make you realize that you want to be a nurse or doctor. In the club I've taken, its a computer support club. It's shown me that in the future I want a position that involves a team, a place where I can take charge, and can fix technology problems. This shows that clubs might help narrow down job choices, with more specific subjects that broad classes can't really hit home with.\n\nFurthermore, it could help you learn about a class that you just couldn't take because of a full schedule. An example of this is me actually. I'm interested in learning photography, but next year i'm taking Spanish and band and as such, I have to pass up on photography. However, if the school had a photography club next year, I could sign up and get a foundation on developing my hobby of photography so I could learn on my own time! this shows that clubs are the perfect opportunity to have fun with the classes that you missed out on for more important things like languages or band. This shows that clubs are perfect to help students who's schedule is just too packed for the average student\n\nBuilding off of that, Clubs could teach important life skills. A few good examples are serving on the student council could teach you how to be an active member in your community, which is an amazing skill to have. Cooking club teaches you how to cook, which is literally a vital skill needed to live. Technology clubs can help you fix your own problems in a world where technology is becoming more and more important and more jobs are opening up to fix said technology. This shows that clubs not only are for fun, but they can help you live a better life overall.\n\nUltimately, clubs can help you pinpoint your career in life, get a taste of that one class you never got to take, and even provide you with skills needed to live in the real world. if you want to get more involved in your clubs, then you can always sign up for one, or think about sponsoring a club of your own to kick start the process and provide other with the tools for success.",

    Essay: "In society today kids have to much free time on their hands, and when kids have too much free time they tend to get into trouble. If they took away some of that free time then kids would have less time to get themselves into trouble, and it would also keep them off of technology. I agree that every kid should have at least one extracurricular activity after school.\n\nThe extracurricular activities keeps kids engaged and involved in their school community. It keeps them busy and moving around it doesn't leave them time to sit around and get in trouble. With the extracurricular activities kids wouldn't go home and have nothing to do. It also keeps their brain engaged and thinking. Kids would be learning something new and interesting everyday. They could learn a new sport and stay active at the same time. Many kids these days just go home and sit around, that isn't good for their health they need to be moving around at this age. Extracurricular actives could also teach valuable skills and lessons like how to work in a team or how to take responsibility for actions or people. These are very important skills in life,and it is very hard to teach those skills in a classroom but it is a lot easier to do on a sports field or in a extraculiclar activity.\n\nExtracurricular activities could help kids become more social. When you join an extracurricular activity chances are you are in there with some new people that they have never met before. It gives kids a chance to meet new people their age and become friends with them. It could also help the kids that are less social or shy become more social. These kids have a hard time talking to other people and if they are given the chances to meet people and talk to them on a regular basses then hopefully they will become less shy and more social. It can also give these kids something to talk about to others. Like how their team is doing or how they like their activities. It also can help kids get over fears. Maybe a kid has stage fright and they try out for theater and the excel at it and get over the fear of stage fright. Or a kid has a fear of public speaking and they try out for the debate team and that helps the get over that fear.\n\nIt could also help kids figure out what their strengths and weaknesses are maybe they go into a sport and find out that they are really good at being a leader. That could possibly open their eyes later on down the road when they are picking their career choice or singing up for collages.\n\nMost importantly it keeps kids out of trouble. With an extracurricular activity right after school kids can't sneak off after school and go get into trouble with their friends.

This will help them develop responsablitty.\n\nWith out extraculiclar activity some kids just go home and get on technology and don't do anything. But with an activity after school it would get them moving around and not sitting on the couch all day.\n\nAn extracurricular activity would also help kids get off their phone and social media. This would also help with kids not getting in trouble on social media because the extraculirrclar activities would be phone free and the more time we get kids off of their phones the less likely they're going to get in trouble on them.\n\nThere are a lot of positives to having extraculliclar activities after school.

    Essay: "Are school days becoming even longer? Well, according to our principal, yes! The decision has been made that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Nobody strives to spend even more time at school, especially it is being forced. In certain circumstances, the times chosen for these activities could get in the way of free time, students could need to assist around the house, and sometimes the clubs or activities can get expensive.\n\nSome students participate in extracurricular activities that may not be through the school. These things take up a tremendous amount of time as is, and then to having to do another activity on top of that, can be very distressing. Other students could also use this time to finish school work. It could be as simple as a small homework assignment, to studying for an S.O.L. This time may even just be social time. Spending time with friends, family, and other important people in their life could be a way to take a break from the extremely stressful school day. Although school and additional activities may be easy to balance for some students, It can be very difficult for others to find the time and the energy to do these things. Having the option to participate in one of these clubs, sports, or councils can give the students time and choice to figure out what they really want to do.\n\nThe time needed to practice for a sport, or do volunteer work for a club, can mean very little time at home. Occasionally, the parents or guardians of the student may need their child's help around the house. It may not seem like much is getting done, but a little goes a long way when it comes to helping out once in a while. Some older students may even have younger siblings to look out for after school. Depending on the situation, the parents might have to work on weekends, which would leave the older child responsibility for their siblings when the parents aren't there. There are also points in time where the student may need to just go home and relax. School can be very draining for some students and make them just want to take a break. This break might be just to take a 30 minute walk, or they might even need to take a few hour nap. It mostly just depends on the person, the classes they take, and even the school they go to.\n\nIn certain homes, money may be an issue. Sports and clubs are most likely going to need some kind of supplies that needs to be provided by the student, or the parent. Although colored pencils and crayons may not seem like a big deal to most people, when families are struggling to pay bills, that's the last thing you'd want them to worry about. Some sports even need a payment just to play the sport. So, paying about fifty dollars just to play, and then having to pay for the shoes, mouth guards, and other appropriate clothing for that sport, will eventually add up to be a lot of money. Not all families struggle with this, but some do. Having to ask your parents for money when you know they're struggling is very difficult. I've personally been in the situation where I couldn't participate in some of the activities because I didn't want to ask for more money knowing it was scarce as is.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities should not be required. Students should get a choice on whether or not they want to participate in these things. There's already a lot of time spent at school learning and doing some of the same things that would be offered in a club. There is no need for a requirement of additional activities. I strongly believe the schools should stick to encouraging students to join, not forcing them. It would make students more independent, responsible and hardworking.",

The extracurricular activity could bring students together and create friendships. There are multiple actvity you can do such as sports, work on the year book, and serve on the student council. It will also get the student more involed with the school and make them feel more comfortable with other students. You don't need to participate in one curricular activity you could particpate in multiple activity's. It give you a chance to get better at something like sports if you have never played sports this gives you a chance to play and even get better at it. There are lots of oppurtunities that open up for you . You don't have to participate in the activity's every day. But if you do wanna come to the activity's you must particpate if not your free to go home.

It is good to have a school that everyone wants to be in something they enjoy, not something that is forceful. Thats why it is best that we should and have the will power to engage in school related activities.\n\nIf we are the students of the school we are basically the foundation of the school, it basically means that the school rely on us, so that we can rely on them. It is said a student is better lived when he or she enjoys something they do and not forcefully done by someone else. it would also help fund the school like for example, if you were in a activity where you are doing the schools yearbook pictures, you are selling those pictures or books afterwards, it strongly help fund the school.\n\niIt is best concluded that activities help instead of hurt the environment of the school it is also concluded that it helps the life of the students so that they can live in a place that they would want to be in not in a place they would not like to be in.",

    Essay: "Should all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Well most school's have extracurricular activity's for their students, but the school's activities are usually optional. I think student's should at least participate in one extracurricular activity, because it will help student's to build friendship's, and have more opportunity's.\n\nFirst of all while a student is doing an extracurricular activity, the student will most likely have to interact with other students. When interacting with new people, that can also lead to building more friendship's. In addition, student's that have more friends will feel more confident and will have a better social life. The students will also feel more comfortable when meeting new people and interacting with them. The student will have more people to talk to and to hangout with. When having more people to talk to will help people see different view points and different idea's.\n\nFinally, a student will have more opportunity's with their life when doing an activity. If they join an activity that will help with high school credits. And college's look for students that can serve for them, so when doing an activity that will help college's notice you more because it will show that you can do something for that college. And you several college's might notice you and you might have to choose one, so you will have different option's to look at.\n\nIn conclusion I can that I think that all student's should do at least one extracurricular activity because it will lead to more friendships and most likely have more opportunities for that student.

    Essay: "Laughing, having fun, new friends, new hobbies. These are just the few benefits from joining extracurricular activities in school. Some schools make students participate in extracurricular activities giving them the advantage to all these benefits. All students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nOne reason why all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because has students get to know new people. A recent article from Generic_School's PTA daily updates have shown that 27% of their students didn't know every one of their classmates. Ever since they established that extracurricular activities are mandatory that percentage has rapidly gone down to 9%. This means that adding in these activities made students get closer to knowing each other. If Generic_School didn't set these rules then what would happen to each student. Maybe there are many kids who don't have someone to talk to but after these boundaries were set they have someone there for them. Not setting these rule on having extracurricular activities have big impacts on student and this can't happen.\n\nAnother reason why all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because it develops stronger social skills. Alex Freeman a professional psychologist reports \"Kids that I have worked with usually don't do any type of social activities what so ever making them not have the capability of carrying a conversation and decreasing the chance on improving social skills.\" In other words these kids who don't do any type of activity have not made any change in socializing and creating conversation. By not including these activities it may bring some of their students down. Adding them on the other hand will one help out with social skills and two will benefit the kids all through out their life. With the disadvantage of no extracurricular activities what will become of our kids if they don't have what they need? What will happen to society if we don't have the ability to even speak to another person?\n\nIn addition to why all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because of money. A report from the Generic_School states \"2 out of 10 student parents don't have the money to afford extra activities outside of school due to numerous of reasons.\" This shows how some kids can't really get to those activities like other kids due to money problems. If schools do add these extracurricular activities then these student parents don't have to worry about spending extra money. By not making this mandatory what could happen to the less fortunate families who are in need of some extra money?\n\nOthers may say that we should not have extracurricular activities because it pushes student boundaries. A student survey from the Wisconsin Department of Student Learning shows that 12% of all students in the state say that when the school makes certain rules mandatory many of the kids say that it's pushing past their limit and forcing them to do something they don't want to do. This means that a small portion of kids feel like if the school makes them do extracurricular activities it's a invasion to their limit. I don't disagree with this but that's just one bad reason out of many good reasons. While it's just 12% that say its a invasion to their privacy theres still the other 88% who think it would be fun and is a good idea. Knowing that more than half of students think it's a good idea really shows that making it mandatory to have extracurricular activities have a greater impact on the students than not having it.\n\nHaving to participate in at least on extracurricular activity should be a requirement for all students. Not only that it helps other student get to know each other better it also improves social skills and helps save money for student parents. Some may disagree that we should add extracurricular activities but they are wrong. Extracurricular activities provide multiple benefits to each student making this a must to schools. Having this be requirement for each school it just can't magically become apart of the system we need to start somewhere. For a starters, start by contacting your local school board of supervisors to give them the idea and hope that it will be passed on. We need to make this happen for your kids and the other generations to come sake but we need to start from the ground up; and thats with you.",

I stayed in the classroom waiting for everyone to leave so I wouldn't get sucked into the rushing stream that was the middle school hallway. Only after I knew it was safe did I leave. I walked down to the classroom ,happiness filling my bones,as I stepped into the class room i knew I belonged there these where my friends. I think that all people should participate in some type of extracurricular activity because I believe that,Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward to throughout the day, getting students involved would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them,and finale involving more student would help open so student up to a wide variety of new experiences.\n\nThe first reason is,Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward to throughout the day. Most students have nothing to look froward to in a normal school day other than little things such as talking to your friends in between blocks or lunch,but with extracurricular activities they have something big to keep them going till the end of school. For many people,such as myself,school is a prison without bars where your forced to learn stuff that you dont want to learn,but with extracurricular activities it feels like you get a choice in what you do.\n\nThe second reason is that, getting students involved would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them. Most student have a wide variety of friend with many different likes,hobbies,and personalty s many of which you don't have in common .Sometimes you just need someone with the same hobbies as you to talk to and what better place to find one is at a extracurricular activity about what your hobbies is!\n\nThe third reason is,involving more students would help open students up to a wide variety of new experiences. Many students are not in extracurricular activities for a variety of reasons .Joining a extracurricular activity can lead to a lot of fun doing something you never thought you would enjoy for example the FFA you could join because you wanted to try it out and new thing you know your white water rafting with your new friend wondering why you didn't sign up before you did.\n\nIn conclusion,I believe that all students should join a extracurricular activity because Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward to throughout the day,getting students involved would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them,and involving more students would help open students up to a wide variety of new experiences.",

    Essay: "Must Students Participate in Sports?\n\nStudents should have their own rights, if they do not want to participate in any activities like sports and clubs they shouldn't be forced to do them. If they do want to participate they can. If they do not want to participate, then we can't force any students to do any activities they do not want to participate in. Everyone has a voice and know whats best for themselves, others should not make any decisions for each other. This is because, other may not agree in what others think. Everyone must have a voice in what they think is right or wrong. Many students don't want to join in any activities and have other things to do.\n\nStudents already have lots of occupations they have in their own time. For an example they have to do school work, be social, clean, and lots more. By adding extra activities it ruins their schedule they have, and the amount of sleep they get. Coming late from practice or staying after to late may ruin the plans they had. Not being able to have enough time to study and do their homework because they were to busy, occupied with the activities they were forced to do.\n\nEveryone needs time for themselves, and school work. Making time for yourself releases stress and if your too tired, you have time to get some rest and catch up on your house cleaning and homework. Studying and doing your homework really does have good effects on your grades. If you are doing your homework on time, the results are good grades. Studying for your classes or the test your gonna have, gives you a better chance of passing that test tomorrow. Which also results in a good grade for school.\n\nThe lack of interest may also be the reason why most students may not want to join any sports and activities. It may not be something they'd like to do. It may not be their passion and may not be something they enjoy to do. Forcing students to do somethings cannot make them like doing it, it just does not work like that. Frustration might happen next, causing students to not do good in the activities or not pay attention and get hurt. No student should be put in that position and be more stressed than they already are.\n\nOccupations are a big part of everyone, because everyone is busy and have things to do. Being busy and having no time to do extra activities. Family time is a part of that, everyone needs time to have dinner together, go to church, be social, and have other things they already do without these extracurricular activities. It can ruin your sleep schedule which will put you in a bad mood and make you frustrated. Adding more things to do will make your day even more exhausting and harder which makes it a struggle, and may cause stress. This stress is unnecessary, we didnt choose to be in an activity and we must have a right to choose to be in one or not.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with this decision because students should not be forced to do any activities if they do not want to. They all have free will, and have a voice, to choose if they want to participate in anything. Students need time for themselves and school work because good results happen like good grades and great attitude. If students are willing to do the activities is because, the choose to but there's a good portion that may not want to get involved into those kind of activities which is okay. Everyone has occupations and have their own schedule, and most don't want to do other activities, because it may get in the way of what they need to do daily. Students must have a choice and an opinion in what they want to do.",

    Essay: "To me, having an extracurricular activity is a very important thing that I do because I have something to look forward to after having a stressful day of school. Instead of going home and doing homework, I can socialize with my friends and stop worrying about other things going on. I think if everyone in the school got that opportunity, students would be more social and be able to make new friends.\n\nPlaying sports has always been a big thing in my family because sports will keep you active and out of the house and the last thing my parents want to see is us sitting on the couch doing nothing, but having an activity will keep you busy. As the years pass, more and more children are becoming overweight, and sports provide daily exercise to prevent childhood obesity and possibly encourage better eating habits. Most sports are one team working together to achieve a common goal. This can teach young athletes teamwork and social skills that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.\n\nWhen I am really stressed out about something, I will usually put my headphones on listen to some music or go outside and play basketball or lacrosse. Doing something you enjoy will usually calm you down and relieve stress. Afterschool activities can really help if you are usually stressed about something. If sports aren't your thing, there are plenty of other activities you can do like clubs and social groups. Joining a social group will help you make new friends and find people that relate to you. Bullying is a serious thing, and something that could reduce or prevent it is a social group. Having people interact with eachother will create bonds and reduce bullying.\n\nSo if all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I think it would benefit the school and the community. This would provide exercise to ones who join a sports team, teach teamwork and social skills, decrease stress, help students socialize, and prevent bullying.",

However, it may not be so bad having extracurricular activity, who knows it may be useful, it could help with social skills, find something your passionate about, or with your grades.\n\nSometimes all you need in life are good social skills. Join a club and try making new friends, you could even try joining a group project. You can also step it up and be a leader of a school project. Or you can try starting your own club. Just listen to the key word and \"TRY\" something new.\n\nHowever, if you do consider joining a club, make sure its a club you like. And its okay if it takes you a while to find something your truly passionate about. Its like a baby learning how to walk, it takes them a couple of times, they'll fall, but they shake it off and eventually they'll get their. Also when looking for a club its always good to try art or music, where can express yourself in anyway possible. And its okay if you don't find what your looking for.\n\nAnd even if you don't want to join an extracurricular activity, at least think about your grades and how it can boost them up. Cause there's a club for everything. For example, if your failing science join a science club so it can at least help understand whats going on.

That would stress me out so much to know that I dont just have to worry about homework, but an after school activity as well! These are a lot reasons not to have this rule, but the four that really pushed me to one side are because some students simply dont have the time to actually participate, students might not care enough to do the after school activity rendering it useless to force them to do something they wont do, it would take their mind off of school work alowing their grades to slip, and students need time to take their minds off of school and just chill out.\n\nWhen I was on the Generic_School soccer team I couldnt keep up with a lot of other things that I did after school like boy scouts. Being on the soccer team meant that when I got home I didnt have enough time to get my homework done and go to scout meetings. Obviously I chose to do homework because\n\nI didnt want to have bad grades. I stopped showing up to meetings until the season was over meaning I couldnt move up a rank, I couldnt see some of my friends, and I didnt learn anything at all about scouting related stuff. Their are students similar to me who would have to give up activities in their lives because they wouldnt have the time to do both.\n\nStudents forced to do an after school activity might not even care enough to actually do the activity rendering it useless to force us to participate in an activity that most of us probably wont do in the first place. If you put this rule into effect get ready for some backlash. Students are already under enough stress as it is, in fact I am under a mountain of stress now writing this. Don't add on to it and give students more reason to hate school, because at the end of the day we still like to go home and relieve that stress thats cooped up inside of us thats making our lives miserable. I know at least 50 people who wouldnt even go to their after school activity so there wouldnt be a point in even trying to get them to do it, that would be like trying to get a cat to sit on command, you can try but sure as heck your going to fail.\n\nIf you put that rule in affect that will take students focus away from school and school work and put it on that activity. Students wouldnt have time to do homework, and trust me when I say that multiple zeros on homework assignments can build up and really do some damage to your grades. Isnt it one of your main focuses to help students get good grades, so taking our focus away from school allowing our grades to slip is going against your own morals.\n\nThis dosent just apply to students, but to every body who has a job as well. At the end of a long day at school or work, dont you want to go home and after doing homework, you just want to chill or just get your mind off the stress that we all have to deal with. Depriving us of that is like depriving us of sleep, because as a human being every body needs a stress reliever at some point. Nobody wants to have to deal with the amount of stress that school just throws on you. We need some time to get all of that stress out, instead of you throwing yet another weight on our shoulders. We need downtime, everybody dose, even god made an entire day for resting! So dont deprive students of that freedom that we all need to stay sane.\n\nIn conclusion we shouldnt be forced to do an after school activity because students simply dont have the time and adding another thing to that schedule wouldnt help, a lot of students will not care at all to be forced to have an after school activity and might not even come, it would get their focus off school work allowing their grades to slip, and after doing homework students like to get their minds off of school and chill.

There are so many different kinds of extracurricular activities or clubs available for students. Although there are many different and unique clubs to choose from, a lot students stay away from joining. If schools were a place where everyone was in a club it would be a better environment. All students being in a club would help the school to keep students competing, keep students fit, and help ready the students for life after high school.\n\nWhen students get older there tends to be a lack of competition. As time goes on students lose interest in school and are often tempted to stop trying. The lack of effort causes grades to drop as well as happiness.

Some students aren't physically fit while others aren't mentally fit. Academic school clubs can help students to stay fit in their brain, such as mathematics or robotics clubs. Athletic school clubs can help keep students in shape with their bodies, such as soccer or football. With either club that they choose the outcome will make them better students.\n\nThere are many students who graduate without knowing how to handle their life after high school.

If they mess up on an announcement they may get laughed at or they may even get talked about not in a good way about it. They are not gonna like it get bullied for it and then they might get scared of coming to school because they don't want to get laughed at or bullied because of it. That is why I don't agree with this idea of having all students do a extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "I strongly disagree because some students don't want to participate in extracurricular activities. Most of the student body have things to do afterschool and they can't attend both at the same time. Our principles shouldn't make somone do something if they don't want to. If the parents don't want their kid staying for extacurricular activites then they shouldn't because what if the parents have something to do with their kids afterschool or they have a doctors appointement.\n\nMajority of the student body at our school doesn't know how to play sports. The coaches at our school put people on the team that doesn't know how to play. What's the purpose of having a team with people that don't know what is going on during the games. If the students dont want to play something the shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. Sport require effort to put yourself on the field and not mess up in front of the coach so that you would be able to make the team and not be embarrassed to not see your name ont the paper while eveyone that made it is celebrating.\n\nIn my opinion the student council is not something we should have at our school. A lot of the student body gets upset because the president promises something and it never happenes and then it turns in a big rivarly between everyone. We learn abut politics in our geography and i think the us as the student body shouldn't be worried about politics as much because then the student body will think that it is ok to do what the politics do and say.\n\nIn conclusion i stated that i strongly disagree because not everyone has the ability to do certain things that others can. I feel that if the students don't want to do extracurricular activites then they shouldn't be made to because they don't want to go out there looking ike a fool or run for president and not make it because they didnt have enough votes. The year book is something that requires a lot of effort and time and not alot of people have pateince to be able to handle what they have to do.",

    Essay: "I agree that they should do the activity Because it can show the teachers of what you know about if you participate. So they dont't repeat it more then once. Like let's say there was a game that a teacher put at the smart board and you need to participate to play. That can also help you review of what you don't understand. To pass your SOL is to review everything we discuss about. When you participate it's also showing the teachers that you already know everything and what you know about and it's also showing that you been following the directions and paying attention in class. It helps students learn fast in other ways. Students can learn fast sometimes when you participate. I once participate like every time in math but once I kept doing it until I understand everything and then I get better and better that no student don't have to complain about it any problem that we don't understand about it. I understand people do not like it but it is what it is. Like my brother never participate but he is no matter what they would say to him that he needs to participate for his grades.\n\nI disagree I guess because people don't like to participate like they can be nervous sometimes and they just don't feel like it. Like sometimes people be shy and are scared. Because when the teacher calls out there name they have to stand up and participate and there scared because they dont know the answer and there like standing up there knowing nothing which makes them feel like there going to say \"i don't know\". Some students want to participate because they know what to answer the question. some do not because they be shy, nervous, and scared. But I was thinking why not participate when we want to. Because people be uncomfterabe like students sometimes be lazy that they do not wanna participate on anything they want or have too and they sometime be stressed about it I sometimes see them having an attitude but I don't know what's up with them but my countselor told me to focus and I alsways be tryig to focus and my old best friend said it was stupid for just trying to get your grades up but not focused on my friends but to be honest grades are much more important and that is why I always go traight to class.\n\nLike we need to participate there is no other choice because that help us learn but I agree because students need too get use to talking in front of everyone. Like I know where shy, nervous, scared, and uncomfterable but I Know we'll get use to that. Because high school is different and I know we'll do that in school so obviously I'm a get use too it. Like writing a speech I know that could be nervous becuase you need to make one and it could be long. but reading in front of everyone is fine everyone does it. I once was scared until I know everyone I didn't feel nervous or anything. I know people don't like to paticipate because there lazy or maybe because there tired and nervous I get now why people don't wanna participate on anything else now.\n\nI guess once you know everyone and friends with them your not like nervous anymore or anything like your comfterable with them because you know them I mean that happen to me. I'm just friends with all my classmates and not even afraid to stand up and say something I'm guessing get use to what your afraid of then you don't have to worry no more and just speak up and finally participate. Of what you know and of what the teacher show you to pass your SOL. Students go to school to learn to learn of what you do not know but want to know once you grow up. When my mom was a thirteen she didn't went to school and now I go to school and I wanna tell her everything so she knows too. When my dad was thirteen he didn't went to school either because my gandma did not have enough money to pay for my parents but now I go to school and I wanna learn something that could happen here on this earth like I wanna know more about this earth something intresting. Like the coronavirus that's in va right now I wanna know more about it to help my family get through it.\n\nI agree with this that people should participate on anything rather there scared or not I agree. Because students should learn once they participate like the game on the smart board. Once I participated on math class and answer my teachers questions that I kept messing up because I didn't know but I wasn't nervous I asked a question or kept trying to get the answer even though I try to guess to get an answer. My parents really want me to have a A in all my classes. I see some students that doesn't wanna work in any classes and they don't want to participate because they don't know and because they don't wanna learn anything like my best friend she does not want me too teach her of what I know. Like all she does is talking with boys and boys but what's important right now is the grades so i can get my dream job and have a nice life with my family and friends and most importantly is not going back to a grade that your in right now and like I been participating since I was a kid in elementary school. I'm here to learn and help my family after the coronavirus my mom is scared so am I because I'm afraid that I'm a die they say coronavirus can kill you and now I wanna learn more about it like maybe read more books about it and find some more definitions about it to let my family and friends know what does it do and what causes it. I agree that they should do the activity to get a good grade and if not participate then you won't be able to pass and move on to learn something new grades are important so I say yes to do the activity even if it's hard we'll keep trying it to finish and to pass and get a A in every class like science we have to do a project then we need to do it in order to know and have a A in that class and the rest the same thing like almost all the classes are like the same which we might do a lot in high school.",

Extracurricular activies helps kids work out and get exersize. Getting exersize is good for kids health. If kids got to work on extracurricular activies they would understaand a little bit more then what they did before.\n\nI do not disagree because if kids got to be more athletic then kids would wanna play some sports like basketball or football.

    Essay: "Principal makes kids do extracurricular activities. I sorry but I'm going to disagree on this one because, parents work and most of the activities have after school stuff so parents that don't get off in time can not pick them up from it. Plus students are given home work to do,so if they do there sports and things how are they going to do homework. my third reason is that sports and activities sometimes cost money to get into,like the club would want you to pay dues.\n\nNext is the activities when kids do them it takes there learning time away. Plus the in sports can be hard to get into. And sometimes you have to have certain requirements to play ,and some people can't make those requirements. But theres also a due that people have to pay so thats why some parents don't let there kids play sports.\n\nFinally the conclusion is that the principal should not make kids do sports or join a club ,because it is a hard time for the parents and the kids to do a sport and worry about a different thing. So some school should not make a students do something that they don't want to do. And the last thing I want to say is that you should never force a student to do something that they don't want to do.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities are beneficial for kids who are bored, want to invest time into earning a scholarship, or want to change something by putting themselves out there. However, does this mean every kid has to?\n\nI don't believe that us kids should be forced to partake in after school activities.\n\nFirst, not all schools provide a wide variety in extracurricular activities, which means that we are limiting the creativity, or expression, in students. So, by telling a student, \"You have to participate in at least one activity,\" you are saying, \"You have to be into these type of categories, or you'll never succeed.\" Children need to understand that you don't need to be a school sports athlete in order to do what you want in life..\n\nSecondly, not all kids have the opportunity to stay after school. Some kids may have to take care of elders, or have a ton of homework. School is important, yes, but kids need to put their important, after school lives, first. Often, most kids' parents get home too late to pick up their child, leaving the kid to walk home, hitchhike, or phone a friend, which may be inconvenient for the friend, and dangerous.\n\nLastly, the kid may lose personal interest in other things. What if he/she decided to join an after school club just to feel left out, or stressed, and grew a bad attitude towards the club? This can cause stress, anxiety, and loss of sleep if he/she is stressed due to their dislike towards the club, but they are being forced, so they can not do anything about it. These causes can effect bad behavior in school, sleeping in class, dropping grades, and lack of interest in learning.\n\nIn conclusion, it should not be required to participate in sports, or activities. Children deserve to make their own decisions in order to have the same experience as an adult.",

    Essay: "7 out of 10 students in every school participate in at least one after school activity. After school activities consist of participating in sports, helping other students out, and cleaning the school. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home, some parents won't allow their children to stay after school, and students will go home later than usual.\n\nI disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students have other things to do at home. Students have to do chores, homework, take care of their siblings, they wouldn't have time to do any of these things. They will have somehow make time or do it some other day. One example of this is one day the principal told me that I had to stay after school to do a sport. Next, I called my mother telling her that I had to stay after. I tried out for track and made the team, I had forgotten that my mother wanted me to cook the chicken because she wasn't going to be home. Later that day, I went home and my mother was furious! I felt so stupid for forgetting to go home and cook the chicken that she had prepared the day before. My mom yelled at me, but she ended up forgiving me but she didn't want me to stay after anymore even if the principal made me. Another example is one day I had to stay after school to clean the floors of the hallways because my principal said the custodians needed help. What's crazy is that same day was my sister's graduation! My own self even forgot to give my mother a call telling her that I was going to stay after. I eventually finished quite fast, actually. After, I walked home and my mother was waiting for me, she asked why I came home so late and if I don't care about my sister. I was literally confused, I had no idea why she was involving my sister into this. Finally, I realized why my mother involved my sister, it was because her graduation! I apologized, and I never stayed after again. Overall, this is why I believe that the principal should not make students participate in at least one after school activity.\n\nMy second reason why I disagree that all students must participate in after school activities is because some parents won't allow their children to stay after school. Parents are very protective over their children, it was hard enough for them to let us go on our first day of school in Kindergarten; now they have to be even more cautious. One example is one day I was in English, which is my last two periods in school. The principal went over the intercom saying that there was going to be tryouts for volleyball. I really wanted to try out, being in a sport is something I always wanted to do. Also, I wanted to get into better shape. After, I called my mother asking if I could stay after school to try out and she said no. My mother and I went back and forth arguing why she wouldn't let me. Her voice started to break and she said that she's scared and she doesn't want me to. So, I didn't try out, I missed all of the try outs for volleyball. Later, my mother got a call from the principal from my school asking why she didn't let me, he overheard our conversations when I was on the phone with her. My mother kept telling the principal that she's not going to let me stay after. Lastly, I never stayed after because I knew my mother was never going to let me. Another example is one day I stayed after school because they were going to play a horror movie in the auditorium and the principal wanted as much students that could stay. I was excited, I've never stayed after school before, it was going to be a day to remember. Soon enough, I feel my phone vibrate. My mother was spamming my phone with text messages! I ran out of the auditorium and called my mom, she was between furious and worried. She sounded like she wanted to cry but also wanting to yell at me and hit me. My mother picked me up from school and we drove around and she told me how if I wanted to stay after I had to let her know before hand. Overall, this is why I think that the principal should not make students stay after school because some parents won't let them.\n\nMy final reason on why I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity is because students will go home later than usual. When students stay after, it's usually for about two hours. In that case, that would mean if school ends at 2:50, then if you stayed after school you would go home around 4:50. An example is one day my friend named Generic_Name stayed after school for a yearbook program. Later on, the program took longer than she expected, she got home around five. Her father screamed at her for coming home so late. It was late for him because the sun was already going down. I felt so bad, she came to school the next day saying she couldn't stay after anymore for the yearbook program or anything dealing with staying after. Another example is I was staying after school for a track meet and I was the manager because the principal wanted me to be the manager. The meet ended at 7:30, I honestly didn't think the meet was going to end at 7:30. My sister came to pick me up and she said if my parents were home they were going to be so mad. I should've sent a text to my sisters or my parents telling them I was going to go home late. Overall, this is why I believe that students shouldn't have to participate in after school activities.\n\nBecause of students having to do other things at home, parents not allowing them to stay after school, and students getting home later than usual, I believe it should not be a must to do an after school activity, even if the principal wanted to.",

Maybe they have to ride the bus home because their parent or guardian has to work. Also, they wouldn't want to walk home if they live far away from the school.

    Essay: "Principals are like the alphas in a school. Everything the principal says, you have to do. My principal decided for every student at the school to be in a activity, or in other words, a club. I agree with this offer because it can give kids opportunities, help them try something new, and be able to fit in a group or student body.\n\nDoing fun things is awesome right? i dont know anybody who likes to stay home and do nothing all day. There are many opportunities out in the world but the principal is trying to bring in even more. Things that you like to do can be in a activity the school has. The activities can probably have big offers. For example, an art club. An Art Club is very artistic. The club draws, paints, and learns different things you've never known about art. The teacher says, one day, that there will be a competition for the best drawing. The competition can help you get better and learn new things. What artist doesn't want to have that big opertunitie? Not only does art have opportunities but other activities do too. For example the student council. the student council helps with fun raising and school activities. If you ever wanted to be in charge of something, you could sign up! that could be a great opertunitie for you.\n\nLearning and trying things is cool right? Sometimes, you can get tired of what you like and what your doing, so you move on to the thing you were into before, to another. Trying new things can help you learn how to do things you havn't even tried. For example, in the movie \"High School Musical\", a boy named Generic_Name loves basketball. He is the team captain and everyone knows who he is. Everyday he practices and gets tired of shooting the same ball into a the same hoop. He goes to school the next day and see's a play is having try outs. Though he has never sang before, He wants to try and see if hes good at it. Doing different things that you normally do is perfectly fine. Not everyone likes the same thing all the time. Learning new things can get you to try even more new things. I've tried it before as well. For example, a girl named Generic_Name is a dancer and wants to take a break from it. Her feet hurt and she thinks she can pull of something else. Her school has many activities and she tries out for the soccer team. Never be afraid to do knew things.\n\nNot everyone is in a certain group or activity. there are students in the world who think they dont fit in and have low self esteem. This offer from the principal can help you fit in a group. These activities can help you make new friends. Making new friends is amazing and you can be proud to say your in a group and have many friends. For example, A girl named Generic_Name is quiet at school. She always has her head down when she walks in the hallways. she never smiles nor talks. one day, the principal gives an announcement about every student being in at least one activity or club. She first say she doesn't want to do it, but tries anyways. In the club she picked, she meets new people and feels happy to be apart of something. this offer can bring you smiles to your faces everyday, Though these activities might not be everyday, you can say proudly and loudly, that you feel like you fit in. Another example is that a boy named Generic_Name has multiple friends. one day his friends leave him and he feels alone. He doesnt think he fits in. he feels like he doesnt want to go to school anymore. when he goes to school, he sees all of the activities that are on a big board. he signs up for a musical and meets new friends. fitting in is a good thing. These activities can help you with so much\n\nPrincipals are helping everywhere around the world. they try there best to make learning fun and create new things like clubs and activities. the principal says every student needs to be in at least one club or activity. though some students dont agree, I do. What the principal is offering is valuable because it can give kids new opportunities in what they like and they can do things they have never done before. It can also help you fit in to a place that you think you wont be able too. every principal is very hard working and i think with this offer, it will bring students together and smiles on all of the students faces.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities can and most likely hurt some people, their friends, or even their families. I disagree that students shold be made to do any extracurricular activities. Most students have stuff to do after school, such as, students miight have to help their parents, go to work to support their families, babysit for their friends or families, or might have people to go with, to somewhere for something they already planned.\n\nFirst, I think he should think about it because it could effect some people, and their families. Some kids after school have chores they do, or people they go with to do stuff. Some kids even babysit, for their family, or friends. So if we were made to stay after school, and do these activities then it could lead to them not getting something done, or even having to make that person find someone else to babysit for them. The student wouldn't be able to get as much done, or to help out someone if they needit.\n\nAlso, what if they arent interested in anything like sports, working on the yearbook, or student council. There are kids that arent interested in those and just have there own thing they want to do that interest them. If there isn't anything to interest the kid then he will prolly end up getting forced to do work, or activities he doesn't enjoy. So what would be the point in having them do this if their not gonna be happy or entertained with what they are doing.\n\nTheir are also kids that work, to help their families if their in need of money. So if they have to do an activity after school they might miss work. Also, if they miss work they will get less money, which can effect how they live, or even if they eat that evening. So these activities should not be mandatory, they should be optional to anyone, and everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, if kids are being forced to do extra school activities, it could effect them very badly. It could cause them to miss work, and not be able to afford food, to ruin their plans with family, and friends, to not be able to help there parents if they need it, and lat not be able to babysit for whoever so they can do stuff. So this is why after school extracurricular activities should not be mandatory for anyone, they should get to choose if they would be able to or if they are interested in doing them.",

    Essay: "Put yourself in a position were you are a student at school and you principle recently announced that every student is going to have to take an extracurricular activity like sports, working on the yearbook, serve at the student council, etc. How would you respond to this and what would you do to defend or argue against it. I argue against it and say that all students should not take an extracurricular activity because they maybe have interest into it, be clueless of what do to in the activity, or maybe have more important things to do instead of that activity. In my paper hopefully I convince you to argue against why students must participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nFirst thing I say a student in some case may have no interest into the activity because he has experienced it before and didn't like it or had a bad experience. For example if the school has only three sport activities like baseball, soccer, and football the student just wants to do a sport. The student doesn't want to do football at all because he couldn't throw as far as all the other kids and got bullied for it having a really bad time. And since there is a little amount of sport activities he will be a lucky guy if he got baseball or soccer. The next day he finds out everything has been filled for soccer and baseball and he doesn't want to do anything else either than a sport so he just has to choose football. What would you do if someone bulllied you for not doing something properly and be afraid to do it again.\n\nSecond thing is maybe the student has no clue in what to do the activity he chose but has to try to do it because his parents think he should try something new in something he or she doesn't like but just wants them to feel happy. If the student joins a science club but enjoys doing coding on computers he or she has to try to do it because he wants to make his or her parents happy. Also the student parents do a check up on him everyday to see what he or she has learned in the science club but doesn't know that much in science so the student can't say much about it. Eventually the student gets tired of it and tells his or her parents he or she doesn't like it but its to late for the student now, every other club is full and can't take anymore now he just has to deal with it. If you were in this situation were you didn't like something and you wated to change it what would you do?\n\nThird thing is if a student has more important things to do like study for a test, finish a big project, or finish late homework but at the same time he wants to practice soccer because he wants to become a soccer player when he or she grows up what can he do to balance things out between school and sports. If there were more activities throughout the school that had both in this case like one week about working on school and another on just sports that would be his or her top choice. So he is going to have to make a difficult choice and both of them can lead him or her to bad things if he doesn't do one or the other. How would you handle this situation of balancing important things out.\n\nIn conclusion I argue against it and say that all students should not take an extracurricular activity because they maybe have interest into it, be clueless of what do to in the activity, or maybe have more important things to do instead of that activity. All I'm saying if you want to make students take extracurricular activity mandatory have more clubs than you can think of so each student can be satisfied or rearrange students after the process of them selecting clubs. Think about hard desicions will be and how will you solve problems that appear out of nowhere.",

Say you just moved to my school and you have very little to no friends, doing these extra activities will help introduce you to new people. When you sign up for something that you enjoy spending your time on, and you meet people there, why not be friends with them? You are building a relationship with people who enjoy the same things as you!\n\nEven if you may not want to sign up for a extra activities, you may end up liking it. When your doing these clubs/activities/extra circulars, they could become your new hobby. Sammy Maple, soccer player for the Men's U.S. Soccer Team, said that he was first introduced to soccer at a young age because his elementary school asked everyone one sign up for a club, and he chose soccer club. From then on, Sammy kept playing and practicing and soon everyone around him saw the pure gift he had for the sport. You can benefit from these opportunities provided through your school in so many ways.\n\nBeing required to take extra circulars can help you build skills. Skills for the workplace, for a future job, or even people skills. In dog walking club we have to make fliers to promote our club so we get clients. I was in charge of making them, hanging them up, and handing them out to people. When making them I learned not to be to wordy with the fliers so they are easy to ready. Next, I learned that when you hand them out, never give them out to people who are not aware of their surroundings. For example do not bombard someone who is on the phone to give them one of your beautifully made fliers. I can use that information if I would ever want to pursue the job of being a sales person or a graphic designer. These are things they can not teach you in any regular science or math class. These activities teach you valuable things.\n\nI have come to see that most people will say that we should not be required to take extra circulars because they take too much energy away from us that could be used in school. Mostly student who are in the more active sports clubs have said this. I disagree with their claim because there are so many different types of clubs and activities you can choose from. If you find yourself having no energy to do homework because you are in the basketball club, maybe you could join the homework club and then play basketball at home with the energy you saved. If you stayed up late the night before and don't have the energy to participate in volleyball club, then you can join the craft club and sit around while painting. There should be no reason that you wouldnt want to join one of the many amazing clubs!\n\nGetting involved with your school is a very important part of your education and can be very beneficial. University of South Carolina of computer math conducted a survey on how many of their 4 year graduates participated in more than 3 extra circulars throughout their high school career. Over 93 percent said yes and the other 7 percent claimed they were part of a home school group. As you can see, that 93 percent definitely got the benefits from those extra circulars.\n\nA take away from reading my essay should be that the school system, and staff have your best interest in mind and want to help. They should do their part in helping us get the best out of our education and require us do take extra circulars.",

    Essay: "Do students have the time before and after school to participate in one or more mandatory extracurricular activities? The life of a student in nearly any grade can be very busy before and after the normal school day. If students are required to participate in these activities, there is a possibility of students becoming overwhelmed due to the added amount of effort put into extracurricular activities. The principal at our school has made the decision that all students participate in one or more extracurricular activities.\n\nStudents that already have activities before and/or after school will find it harder to participate in the activities listed by the principal. If conflicts were to occur in ones schedule, by perhaps reducing study time, discombobulating meal times, effecting sleep, conflicting with appointments, etc, the negative effects on a students general academics and personal life could be great. Foresay, a student may have a doctors appointment immediately after school, but also have to attend an important meeting with the student council at the same time. If this were to occur, how would the student respond to either missing the appointment, or missing the meeting? There would be consequences for both since the principal made participating in these extracurricular activities mandatory.\n\nBy participating in before and/or after school extracurricular activities, students may feel overwhelmed or stressed out with the workload and effort that must be put into these activities. Along with personal activities, and daily duties they must fulfill, and academic work at home, completing a quota for an extracurricular activity everyday or on a selected day will most likely result in the student feeling constantly overwhelmed. If our principal closes down the activities, or at least listens to the students say in this and changes the concept of these activities to a more efficient manner, then students will most likely switch to a positive outlook on supporting extracurricular activities.\n\nIf our principal does not allow students to have a choice in whether or not participating in extracurricular activities is mandatory or not, the results will not be positive for many students in and out of school. In a normal school day, students may have before and after school activities making their lives very busy. With mandatory extracurricular activities added to the already busy lives of students, students may feel overwhelmed and stressed out with the extra work at task. If the principal doesn't do something about this problem soon, many students will be angered and forced to battle with different emotions. Also, no one will likely find any positives with regards to extracurricular activities if everyone has a negative mindset caused by these activities.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities are unnecessary, yet useful tools for success. All over the world, students participate in extracurricular activities; they do what that they enjoy or excel at. The ability to control what one does after school is refreshing to many students; they are overcome with the powerful feeling of independence. They can choose to play sports, take an art class, or argue in debate club. Students can also choose to go directly home and study. The decision to make extracurricular activities mandatory should not be enacted because it takes away freedom, does not account for all circumstances, and does not ensure interest in the activities.\n\nIn this day and age, freedom is a right many students do not feel they have. They are required to go to school for eight hours. After school, homework, studying or helping out around the house must be done. While those tasks are time consuming, the typical student should have enough time to participate in at least one extracurricular. However, the principle of controlling the time a student has after school is not right. Freedom is making a choice based on what one desires. It is not choosing to do something because it is mandatory. With this new rule, students will feel locked into something they did not consent to. The feeling of independence will inevitably dull. This rule would send the message that freedom, the concept the United States was founded upon, is not a priority in education.\n\nSecondly, the life of an adolescent does not solely revolve around school; many go through struggles in their life outside of their educations. For example, some students have jobs that allow them to provide for their families. For a struggling family, the money earned might be used to put food on the table, or pay for electricity. Forcing a student to join an extracurricular would limit their time, thus limiting their income. This requirement could hurt a student more than it helps. That is the issue with the rule, it does not account for everyone and their situations. A student might be struggling in school and need the time after school to focus, as opposed to playing soccer. The circumstances of each individual student are sometimes unknown, and hard to categorize. Consequently, expecting everyone to gain from a restricting rule such as this one is unreasonable. Students have different commitments and circumstances they live with, forcing a student into an unwanted activity is unfair to them and their families.\n\nFinally, requiring students to participate in an extracurricular does not ensure they will be interested in that activity. A student who does not care might chose art club, then pull the entire class down with a negative attitude. In another situation, the student might not actively engage in the club at all. Someone with no interest in a club would be wasting the time of the people around them and their own. Time is precious, for people only have a certain amount of it before they leave. There is no point in spending this treasure on something of little to no interest. There is the solution of finding another activity, but some students are not interested in the selection offered. Additionally, some students do not care enough to find a more enjoyable activity. Without this requirement, students would have the ability to take their interests and engagement and do what they please.\n\nIn conclusion, limited freedom, different situations, and low interest in activities are reasons why the requirement of after school activities should not be forced upon students. A mandatory extracurricular takes away the choices and independence given to students. Because all circumstances are different, it would not be right to require all students to spend their time on unnecessary activities. Lastly, interest cannot be born from nothing; an uninteresting activity to a student would be irritating to him or her and those around them. The ability to chose what one does with their time is an important skill for life; students must learn for themselves what interests them and how they personally benefit from their decisions.",

For ex it can give yourself confident to show who you really are. As well it will let you meet other people or possibly make a new friend. Also help you see what kind skill you might have for your future. That is the first reason why communicate is helpful in the extracurricular activity.\n\nThe second reason is that help you learn new thing. That you may have never seen before and it can show hard work. One of the extracurricular activity is sports like basketball. One thing it can teach you to be a leader and a good team player. The other extracurricular are the yearbook and the serve on the student council. The extracurricular activity can help your education. By helping you learn how to count money and take photo and put data on the computer. At the end extracurricular activity can help your mind set grow even after school. Your mind is grow every single day this just makes it grow faster.\n\nThe finally reason it is good for the school in many ways here are some ways. It can help school rise money and school spirit.

Also the extracurricular activity helps you not be lazy and just stay home and eat all day or night. It can get you out of the house for a while. The last thing is you can be on the basketball team and it can make your team pound or if you just what to have fun you can also do that.

    Essay: "If your principal was to make a rule saying that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity how would you feel about that? I would feel like I was being forced to do something that I may not want to do. By making students participate in at lest one extracurricular activity could bring so much impact whether its good or bad and I think its mostly bad.\n\nFor example, a big problem is money, schools might not have enough money to support and make all these activity so they would have to cut school field trips, and other fun things that the students look forward to doing. Another problem is that parents might not have enough money to go out and buy the things needed for that activity let alone the things they need for themselves to eat, drink, and sleep under a roof at night, or maybe if the school says they will have it how would they get the money. Would we even have enough money to go on trips if we needed to, say we win matches, games and go to a competition to see who is the world winner we wouldn't have enough money for that so we wouldnt be able to go.\n\nTherefore brings me into another problem time, we would have to plan to go to those competitions and matches, games for that activity, and the students might not even be able to go to the extracurricular activities because they already signed up for one after school they wouldnt be able to make both everyday unless they quit one, or try to switch schedules if they could but if they couldnt, the students would have to quit the one that there doing outside of school they dont get a choice to pick witch one to quit because the principal said the students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. If students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity on top of the one their doing outside of school when would they have time to do homework, study for tests, hang out with friends and family they wouldnt be able to on weekend because they would be busy with that activity and on weekends they would rather have fun and hang out with friends than do homework I know I would.\n\nMeanwhile, stress is a big and rising problem, students already stress enough with all the homework and tests that they have to do so by adding in work things onto their plate in going to lead to more stress and more failing grades do to stress and not being able to get work done in time. Stress is one problem a lot of people deal with and normally its mostly from school and by having a rule that all students most participate in at least one extracurricular activity your going to see a lot of students breakdown form stress.\n\nAlthough having a rule that says that you must participate in at least one extracurricular activity could bring more people to be fir if its a sport or if its just like a debate club, chess club, or over all something like that it allows students to take a break from all the work they are doing, and instead of making it a thing you must be in you could say its optional and students would mostly likely be willing to join these activities.\n\nTherefore, having this rule buy saying students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity should not be allowed because it overall isnt going to be useful or helpful buy creating more problems.",

    Essay: "There are millions of schools across America. Many schools offer extracurricular activities after, before, and during school. I believe that extracurricular activities are a great way to become more social and outgoing within your community, but I don't think it should be forced upon either. Yes, you may have those kids who would love to socialize more, but you also need to look at the bigger picture. Millions of children get bullied everyday for anything, clothes, appearance, religion, etc. I have come to terms with the fact that you can't change people, but you can prevent unspeakable situations from happening. I disagree with forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities because they may get over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time.\n\nFrom a students perspective, another extracurricular activity may be enjoying, others may not agree. As stated, three of these possible activities are student council, sports, and working on the yearbook. The possibility of getting over worked is very high. If a child thought they could be on the student council, but realized it was to much for them, what would happen? Could they just leave the council or would they have to go through with it? What if they didn't say anything at all because they we're too embarrassed? Children already have to go with so much already believe it or not. Kids already have homework, projects, tests, etc. Then to add another chip on their shoulder, kids could become very stressed with their activity.\n\nBullying has been very big problem these past couple of years. Lots of it has to do with social media. Still, many kids get bullied in school. Based on how they look, how they dress, what they bring to eat, religion, and more. That could happen so much easier when you add another extracurricular activity. For example, lets say a student chose to do sports, and this student wears a hijab as part of her religion. Everyday she's told to take it off or is called slurs by other classmates in her activity class that she has never met before. It's the same people every day, she just shrugs it off. She then finally says something to a teacher. They finally get suspended for how many days, and are kicked out of the sport class. Everything is fine now, right? Wrong, she will always remember what they said to her, and it could've been prevented if they didn't force an extra class.\n\nMany kids have their own out of school activities. A child may get caught up in both of their activities. For example, lets say that a student has to go to school for their activity, but they also have soccer practice. If they go to practice then they miss the in school activity, and if they go to school then they miss their practice. Both are very important to the student, but they need to choose. They shouldn't have to choose, and then be stressed about the other decision.\n\nAdding another extracurricular activity may make a student over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time. I think that if you want to do an extracurricular activity you can, and if you don't want to you dont have to. If you did do another activity what would the end goal be for that. Would it be to make kids social? Would it make kids try and trust each other? Maybe, forcing children to communicate with one another isn't the best choice?",

    Essay: "School Activities\n\nParticipating in extracurricular activities at school is very enjoyable and gives people something to do. There is a wide variety of activities that are available to participate in at school like playing sports, working on the yearbook, and being apart of the student council. Although many choices are available, that does not mean everyone is required to be apart of a club or organization at school. It should not be mandatory to do school activities because people may do other activities outside of school, not be interested in taking part in school activities, or have no time and money to be apart of a school group. An important part of being a student and a teenager is making their own decisions by picking what they like and don't like. Middle School and High School students are more independent and responsible, so they make their own choices on what activities to partake in.\n\nFirstly, a majority of students participate in other activities outside of school. Sports are the most common things for students to do in their free time. Playing school sports should not be mandatory because students who play travel sports or any type of sport outside of school already have to deal with complicated schedules and practice times. It's not just sports that take up so much time though; students have to do homework, study, make time to hang out with friends, and have hobbies that they find fun and relaxing. If students do activities outside of school like playing sports or writing stories, they might not care to play sports or be in a writing club for the school because they already do those things outside of school on their own time.\n\nSecondly, some students do not want to do any activities. Not everyone has to do something if they don't want to, because participating in educational activities at school is something that should be optional and not required for all students. Playing sports, working on the yearbook, or being apart of a student council does not appeal to every single student at a High School or Middle School. Even if a student is interested in art and painting, that particular individual does not have to be in an Art Club at school unless they choose to be. It is always good to have an average amount of members in each club so all clubs are equal and can represent the school by the activities they take part in. But, by creating a rule that students have to be in at least one club, students may join random clubs just to abide by the rules, even though they show no particular passion or liking of their club of choice. When this happens, nobody will actually care for the activity they chose because they would've been forced to be apart of it, which takes away the fun.\n\nLastly,\n\nStudents may not have enough time or money to be involved in school sports, yearbook club, or a student council. Activities like sports or organized clubs can have practices, games, or meetings daily. More Specifically, sports gear costs a large amount of money and needs to be replaced once in a while. Transportation could also be an issue for getting to and from the school or places that students hold games or meetings. If a student tries to balance a school activity, something outside of school, and homework, they could become stressed and not perform as well in those three activities. Overall, the decision of whether or not a student participates in extracurricular activities should be decided by each individual student themselves, because everyone is different and knows how many activities they can handle at a time.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the principals' decision to force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity on school grounds. The principal should just highly encourage students to participate in things like sports, clubs, and organizations instead of creating a rule about them. A lot of different kinds of people go to school,and not everybody shares a common interest. Whether it be Middle School or High School, there is not going to be a club or extra curricular activity for everyone to be themselves and thrive with their peers. It should not be mandatory for students to be apart of extracurricular activities at school because of students having hobbies outside of school, not be interested in doing these activities, or they have don't have time and money to join a school group. So, instead of forcing all students at school to be involved, create more options for all different types of people to join. This whole problem can be solved by posting fliers or making announcements about upcoming events or new clubs.",

    Essay: "When was the last time you participated in a school activity? Participating in some extracurricular activities is actually a great way to represent your school. Things such as playing a sport for your school, working on the schools yearbook, writing a school newspaper, or serve on the student council are some great ways you can participate in school activities. Although, some activities can be a stress reliever for some students, others can also cause stress to some pupils that already have a lot on their plate. That being said i believe that it should not be obligated to participate in a extracurricular activity, but instead it should just be left as a choice.\n\nAs I mentioned before, sports are a great way to participate in extracurricular activities. Not only is it good for that, but participating in sports in general relieves a lot of stress, helps with exercise so it's good for your health, and a great way to practice partnership and communication. If you are on a team for your school, college coaches can come to your school and see how you and your team play. If they like how you play and want you on their team you can get a scholarship become a professional and make a career out of it, if you really love playing that sport. You never really know what the future holds, and a lot can come out of one choice and or decision you make. I believe participating in a school sport is the activity that most students would choose because a lot of pupils love sports and it is a fun activity to do with your friends and others.\n\nOther activities that I mentioned were helping on the schools yearbook, writing a school newspaper, serve on the school council, and etc. Things like this can maybe give students extra credit though it would depend on what you are participating in. This might also look good in college interviews because it is showing them that you were interested in school activities and were well managed with the things you had to do in them. If you are a person who is well managed these activities would be great to join. They can also, help you improve on your photography, writing, and managing skills. Even though these activities are great, and good to show on college interviews it is still not a good reason to obligate this choice for students, because some can feel like they have way to much things to keep track of and adding an extracurricular activity on their hands is just too much for them to handle.\n\nIn conclusion, i believe yes that these activities should be free for all, but should not be an obligation. Instead of obligating it as a must it can be left as a choice and or option for students who would like and enjoy participating in the school activities. I disagree in the fact that making students participate in extracurricular activities should be a must. Some students have too much on their plate and just do not have the time to participate in these activities. Some scholars can also feel stressed out and or pressured by having to see or choose what activity they like that interests them so they can join. In my opinion i would not obligate this option, and would just leave it as a choice.",

    Essay: "I dont agree with the principle. Some people don't like staying after school. Students might have plans after school so they couldn't come. Some people just don't like being forced to do something that they don't want to do. There might not be some classes that students don't like. If they wanted to do some extra curricular classes they would of done so already. The principle should not force students to do extra curricular activities because they have other plans, the school doesn't offer any classes that students like, and they just don't like school.\n\nSome students have plans after school. If the principle forced them to do extra curricular activities they couldn't do it. Everyone cares about their social life. If they didn't go, their social life could be hurt. Nobody wants to miss hanging out with their friends. If they keep missing these their plans they could get a reputation for not showing up for things. Nobody wants to be late for something they care about. People should be able to do things outside of school. Besides if students don't show up for their classes, the school would just be wasting the teachers time. Everyone should be able to do the things they want without being in school.\n\nThe principle might not be able to offer all the classes the students want. There might not be things students want to do. If you didn't offer enough classes of different variety, students would become angry and upset that they couldn't offer the classes they wanted. Some people might not like the classes you offer to them. Some people are not into sports. They might not be good at art. There wouldn't be anything that students like. So then they would be forced into something that they don't really like or are not good at.\n\nSome students just don't like school in general. If students don't really like school they wouldn't want to stay there longer than they have to. People don't like to stay at places they don't like for periods of time. If they did they would just hate it even more than they did before. Even trying to make fun things to do after school is over is still not going to make them like school even more. Especially if they are forcing you to do so. Some people would rather stay home and do something than stay at school longer. If the principle did this, people would just not like school that much. You can't always change people's opinion about stuff.\n\nFinally, we can't force people to do something they don't want to do. If somebody did want to do an extra curricular activity they would of done do already. It would not be fair to force students to do something like this. People are going to be upset if the school doesn't have classes for everyone to enjoy. You should try to change sombody's opinion like this because it would affect other people. Don't try to force your students to do something if they don't have the time to do so. Stop, don't try to this ever.",

    Essay: "Whether it's being on a sports team or taking extra classes, I think it is a good idea for all students to do an extracurricular activity. I agree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities because students can interact with new people and it will improve home and school life.\n\nThe first reason students should participate in after-school activities is they can interact with new people. Students will have opportunities to make new friends during it. They can learn teamwork by interacting with other people, including coaches, teachers, and kids. Also, students can learn many other life skills by meeting new people. For example, they learn collaboration by working with others on a sports team or working on a group project. Interacting with new people is great for students and their futures.\n\nAnother reason to support extracurricular activities is it improves students home and school life. Students can earn better grades because others, their teachers or coaches for example, will encourage it. Some activities require good grades in order to do them. Less fortunate students could escape to their activities to forget problems they may have at home. Additionally, students can have trusted relationships with adults in their activities so if they have problems, they can talk to them about it. Students need to have good home and school lives now so they can focus on their future. An extracurricular activity can help them do that.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities. It helps students make new friends and learn teamwork. Also, you can learn different life skills from the activity. It improves home and school life by earning better grades and having places to go to when you need it. Another good thing about it is you have many adults you can trust and talk to about situations. After-school activities is a great experience for students and is a good idea for everyone to do it.",

    Essay: "I am wondering, why is this even happening? The principal is making a huge decision. Every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with the principal's decision to do this. There can be negative consequences with it. I think students should not have to participate because things would be complicated, the students may not have the activity they wanted, and it wastes more of students' free time.\n\nI think students should not have to participate because things would be complicated. First, it makes slightly more work for the teachers. The extracurricular teachers would have an unpleasant time checking for students like a regular class would. Second, there could be a problem with some students. Since all students have an extracurricular activity, some won't even bother to do it, and they might mess around in that activity. Third, there would be more unnecessary trouble with that. It's not right to give out detentions to students who don't want to participate in something extra. Things could go wrong if all of the school's students have to join, but what about the activities?\n\nI think students should not have to participate because the students may not have the activity they wanted. To start with, that already happened with electives. We don't want another thing similar to happen, so one is enough. Next, there would be students who are going to complain. There shouldn't be a school where the students give negative comments about extracurricular activities. Lastly, the amount of students that are not satisfied makes the activities look like a joke. What's the point of extracurricular activities when unsatified students are forced to participate in it? When all students are in an extracurricular activity, there are always some, or most, who don't get their wanted activities.\n\nFrom the principal's point of view, I can understand that students should not be lazy. To prove that, students should be participating in extracurricular activities because they may have nothing to do but play their games. However, that only consumes more of students' free time. To support it, assignments and homework are known to take up a huge chunk of time. They have already been a problem, so why add another conflict that students have to worry about? Students could be using free time to finish their assignments and homework instead of the extracurricular activities they have to do.\n\nThis is why students shouldn't be required to join in extracurricular activities. Three main negative consequences can go along with that. Stuff would get more complex, the students may not have their desired activity, and it takes most of the students' break time. After all the details and examples that I have gave, I am able to say that extracurricular activities should be optional for students.",

Extra school activities such as Flag Football and Game Room are great places to talk and play with friends. Students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity\n\nOne activity that is good for your health and is fun is sports. Sports can help you lose weight. While playing a sport your body burns calories and also burns off unneeded fats. Participating in sports can be lots of fun. While playing a sport you and your friends can talk and play and maybe even make new friends. Sports can help in future careers.

    Essay: "Should all students be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? There are many children who feel like they dont belong because they hang out with the wrong group or no group. School is very hard and can be tougher with nobody to talk to when you need it. There is proof that school is harder with no friends so I think they should be required to do an extracurricular activity.\n\nBecause school can be very difficult if you have no one to talk to or nobody to hangout with. It is a good idea for children to be required to do an activity. I dont think someone should have to do what the principal wants them to do. I think they should be allowed to choose what activity they want to do. This could also help with making friends and getting to know new people and talking instead of being antisocial.\n\nThere are many benefits to doing this in your school you can find the group you are supposed to be hanging out with. Im not saying drop your friends that you already have but add them to your friends and make them feel more included. There are other benefits to doing this with your school such as learning a new sport or learning something new about a topic or game. There is also a way to communicate and get to know your teachers more like if you are not into sports I think they should make teachers participate too. The teacher have to play a sport or help kids with homework.\n\nThere are disadvantages as well as advantages of doing this idea. You are being forced to do something not everyone wants or can do.

This idea is very smart but I think that at the beginning of the year children should be allowed to vote on what they want to do. They should have someone draw out of a hat and choose twenty ideas for clubs and you get new clubs every nine weeks. This is a very good idea for kids who dont like talking to people and are having problems with there sport or something.

    Essay: "Want to take advantage of your life? Try new things, overcome things you thought you'd never pass, or maybe you felt incapable of doing a physical sport? I feel like participating in at least 1 extracurricular activity should be needed to learn more about yourself and others. Here's why:\n\nYou could learn new things. Maybe you had stage fright or you thought you might be lacking some acting skills, but you try out anyways. You join drama and meet many new people, you tell them about your stage fright and they tell you ways on how they deal with it. You now feel good and you find Drama way more easier. You then audition for the main character, which many, many people tried out for. A week goes by and the teacher is ready to announce who is the main character. You made it! People might usually think that they'll be bad at doing something they're are new too, but you never know, if you never try. Who knows maybe one day in the future someone may ask you to act for their movie, and since you have that knowledge from before, you could be a new celebrity. For example one time I tried out for soccer, thinking I would be terrible at it and I would never be drafted, but soon after, I got in. And I was actually one of the best players in my team.\n\nMy second reason is that you could meet many new people. Who knows really. Maybe if you participate in an art club, you could meet your future best friend, but if you never try it out, you'll never know. You could meet people that are an expert in a certain topic, for example you met someone who is super good at building, maybe in the future if you're not sure on how to build something and need help, you could call them and they could help you for free, instead of paying a carpenter. If more and more people are needed to participate in extracurricular activities, there would be less introverted people, who feel isolated from the community.\n\nI really do agree with the principle on this new rule. This could really show a positive impact to kids, mentally and physically. There are many people who are too lazy to do any extracurricular activities, but with this new rule, it could really make a difference with themselves physically. Maybe if they joined and played football or soccer, it could really help him be more physically active. There are some people who feel depressed and lonely. They feel like no one cares about them and that they're not needed in anyones life. Maybe if they participate in something they could meet new people and they could have new friends. Their friends would care about them and make them feel more happy instead of lonely. People could even turn into the complete opposite and be a lot more social than they where before. More people will have a positive mindset on things and more people could be more energetic, which could lead to healthier people, better grades, more participation, a healthy community, and a lot more.\n\nThe real reason on why I feel like this is a good rule though, is because you just need to take advantage of your life. Try new things everyday. If things don't workout or if you're not too good at something, oh well. At least you know now and at least you tried it out. The more you know now, the more you'll be able to do things for yourself in the future, and really, you will thank yourself. You could have a really bright future if you know how to do a variety of things. This is why I feel like the principle came up with an excellent idea and that it should definitely be applied to the school.",

    Essay: "The Principle has made the decision that all students currently enrolled at the high school must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, however I believe this is a terrible decision. My personal belief is that making students do something extra besides schoolwork may lead to backlash by both students and parents.\n\nIf the Principle does follow through with this decision the result would be rather troubling and frankly I fear that the productiveness of all students could decline as a result of forced activities. While some students taking part in extracurricular activities may do some good, forced participation by all students attending the schools is downright foolish. For situations like the one we are currently faced with one must think about whether or not to support this. In my personal viewpoint I believe this all boils down to a risk/reward scenario meaning is the reward higher than the risk or the other way around, but I ensure all of those reading this that the risk is higher than any conceivable reward.\n\nIf all students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity then some parents may file complaints of their children getting home later than expected. Many students may get upset at the fact that they have less time at home to spend playing games, spending time with family or pets, or watching television. Multiple students could use the extra activities during the day as an excuse for not being able to do homework. Students may get stressed with too much additional stuff added to their schedules leading to them being more irritable, tired, and all around less productive. Students may attempt to fake sickness as to avoid participating in an extracurricular activity they may be displeased with.

    Essay: "Every student's dream is to be successful, happy, and healthy in life. One thing that can help people achieve this goal is by taking a part in an extracurricular activity. Whether it be sports, debating, getting work done, or just hanging out, students can gain experiences that can guide them in the path of life. Just by partaking in one after school session, new life lessons can be learned, and things like social skills, core virtues, and new work ethics can be absorbed and applied to daily lives. With that being said, extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students in many ways, including introducing new hobbies, helping to build friendships, and pushing students out of their comfort zones.\n\nHobbies start out as small things that people do for fun. As time passes, that hobby can become a part of people's daily lives. They constantly use what is learned from those experiences and apply it to other things. It is very useful in so many ways, but some people either choose not to show their talents, or don't know where to start. By committing to an extracurricular activity, people can explore many different genres of platforms that they can express their skills on. By being able to express their talents, their stress levels can make a steady decrease, and they can focus on the things that make them happy.\n\nSome people can make new friends very easily, but unfortunately, some people are not blessed with that talent. Through extracurricular activities, anyone can find people who have similar interests as they do, where as that can be hard to find in a big places, like new schools or churches. By joining clubs and other programs, people can have fun with other people that they normally would not think to be friends with. For example, a couple of kids that enjoy playing soccer in their free time want to join a soccer club. They attend an interest meeting after school and meet lots of other boys that share the same interest in soccer as they do. When they go to the first practice session, they see all their new friends and have lots of fun with them. In addition to making new friends and hanging out with them during the after school session, the new friends can greet each other in the hall and introduce them to friends that don't go to the soccer club. There are many other instances where something like this could happen, so joining an extracurricular program is very much recommended.\n\nAlthough it may seem scary, pushing students out of their comfort zones is a very effective work ethic used by parents and teachers that want their children to succeed. By doing this, teens are more likely to acquire good results, no matter what it is that they are trying to succeed in. If a child is pushed to commit to an extracurricular activity, they will not only see how fun it can be, but they can also see how it can help them get further in life. Extracurricular activities are designed to not only help students find what they are interested in, but they help students that are having a hard time. They are suited for people that aren't able to go to other places to join clubs and people that have schedules that are not suited for other places. Extracurricular activities can ensure a safe, fun place that provides a place for students to express their creativity.\n\nIn some ways, extracurricular activities can be intimidating to people that are scared to go out and meet new people. Nevertheless, extracurricular activities can help people explore new passions, make new friends, and be pushed to always try their best whenever and wherever. If people have a hard time finding out what after school activities they should participate in, they should always go to their counselor for help or talk to another trusted adult. At the end of the day, extracurricular activities are a fun alternative to going other places that will always there to benefit you and guide you to a sure success.",

    Essay: "Do you like to go home and sleep, play video games, watch television, or even play with friends? Well now you... cannot. The principal of your school has decided to make extracurricular activities mandatory. Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory because, students need, family time, rest time, and play time.\n\nStudents need to have time with their families. If students do not get family time, then they could become mentally sick and incapable of certain tasks and activities. There are also many benefits of family time. Some of those benefits are: better relationships with others in the family, improved behavior, and all-in-all improved mental health.\n\nThe average child needs 8-9 hours of sleep each night. Many children already do not achieve this amount of sleep because of school. If the Principal makes extracurricular activities mandatory, then most students will have to sacrifice play time and possibly even family time. The performance of students on tests and other class work will start to go down. It will affect the school as a whole if the students are over-tired and slow.\n\nNormally, students are able to hang out with friends, play video games, watch TV, and other activities that the students enjoy. Studies have shown that a little bit of play time or video games each day helps kids to focus. The students could then use that focus to do better in school. If students are being forced to participate in extracurricular activities, they will most likely just lose focus and do worse in school.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities should not be mandatory, students need, family time, rest time, and play time. The lack of mandatory extracurricular activities will help students physically and mentally. They will be able to focus, have good behavior, and even do better in their studies. That is why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular is a right, a choice in what us students get to do or don't. Not a mandatory rule the school forces upon us. I believe that every student should not be forced to do a extracurricular activity.\n\nI think students should get to choose if they do work sports or put effort into clubs. They shouldn't be forced around by rules to do things. I disagree on mandatory extracurricular activities.\n\nExtracurricular actives are extra time added to the already long school day. Students work for a total of 6 hours and 40 minutes a day and the addition of the homework and projects with averages up to about 8 to 9 hours and day, we focus on school work. We don't need more time added to our already long and stressful day. Some students have a lot of other things going on in their personal lives outside of school. So forcing student to stay after to do dance, sports, clubs, art is a waste of time, materials, and money. Paying for the equipment to do sports, paying the teachers and janitors for staying after school hours, materials needed for the clubs. Making kids do extracurricular activities creates a ripple effect, affecting the the whole school, it being money or on people.\n\nAnother reason is that the school doesn't provide to the students in what they are interested in. So being forced into an club or group that you are not fond of, it will only discourage them and unmotivated the student not to try there best. If a student doesn't find the actives interesting and entertaining they wont care and they should get to decided if they get to put work and effort into a curtain activity. But having 1000 plus kids in about a few activities will make the some of the activities more crowed and more packed. And the teacher to kids ratio won't work out, 1 teacher with 50 kids. That sounds like a not of work for the teacher. But imagine the buses and the parents in the cars that came to pick the kids up. The bus is gonna be stuffed with kids and the kiss and ride line is gonna be extremely long. And picture the traffic in front of Generic_School, all of the cars and all of the buses trying to get to their locations.\n\nIn the end I believe extracurricular actives shouldn't be forced but more encourage. Schools should know that students are busy, that students are not interested in the same things, and to be aware of the ripple effect caused by making extracurricular activities mandatory.\n\nBut more importantly the student should be the ones who get a say in what they would like to do or not to do after school and be the ones who choose to stay for the actives.",

    Essay: "The principal decides that he wants to make kids join extra curricular's, I do not agree with this because, the principal should not \"force\" kids to join or do any activity. Kids should have their own choice whether they want to join or not, and they should be able to have a variety and enjoy it.\n\nFirstly, kids want to be able to enjoy school, they want to have fun.\n\nBut if the principal agrees to go on with his plan , has he thought about what the kids want?\n\nIf a kid wants to have a certain activity in play, but that certain activity isn't available, what can he do?\n\nSchools don't really provide much of a choice to choose from, kids want to have a wide variety of options, but with the same topics over, and over it's going to be less interesting.\n\n\"Soccer, yearbook , photography, art, football, cheer, and study hall\" , these are the same one's that an average person would usually hear for their choices of activities.\n\nBut what if they want more, what if they want more options, and choices?\n\nThere would be no point in joining something if they weren't happy about it, they would want to have fun and enjoy what they would be doing, they wouldn't want to waste their time doing nothing.\n\nIf kids are enjoying something, they tend to become more euphoric.\n\nIf being happy makes them enjoy the subject that they are doing, then this will encourage them to keep on doing the activity.\n\nWhile we encourage kids to do more, we are teaching them new skills as well.\n\nAlso, as adult, and as kids.

    Essay: "Soccer club. Art club. Drama club. The list goes on. These are all different extracurricular activities that almost all schools offer. Extracurricular activities can include anything from sports to bird watching, and they are all great ways to spend your time! For years, schools around the country have provided clubs and other extracurricular activities, so you should take advantage of that. All students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n\nFirst of all, taking part in an extracurricular activity helps students be more socially involved. According to Generic_Name, a guidance counselor at Generic_School, 96% of students that participated in one or more extracurricular activities have more friends. In other words, it is highly likely that a student will make a new friend or gain friends in an extracurricular activity that they participate in. Increasing the number of friends a student has would then make them more socially involved.\n\nNot only that, but participating in an extracurricular activity will increase a student's self-esteem. \"Students that have taken part in extracurricular activities show higher signs of happiness and self accomplishment,\" says Robert Hilton, a pediatric physiologist and expert in child behaviors. Put simply, students that have been in out-of-school activities are happier and appreciate themselves more. This means that if students were required to take part in extracurricular activities, they would all have increased self-esteems.\n\nAnother reason is that students can find talent that helps them become successful. The Organization of Career Study, a group of people that help people study to get jobs, determined in a survey that 77% of employed people found the skills that they now use in their jobs from when they were part of extracurricular activities. Put simply, most people discovered the skills they need for work from extracurricular activities they participated in as children. If it was required for students to participate in out-of-school activities, many more people would find inner talents that could help them get a job some day.\n\nPeople who don't like extracurricular activities say that requiring students to join out-of-school activities deprives them of time after school to complete homework. Generic_Name, a mother of 5 kids that participate in extracurricular activities, says \"all 5 of my children come home from their after school activities at 6:00PM and have to be in bed by 7:30PM, leaving them only hour to eat dinner, take showers, complete their homework, and finish their chores.\" Jameson is saying that her kids don't have enough time to do everything they have to do after school because of their participation in after school activities. However, students can still participate in extracurricular activities and have time after school for things such as homework and chores. The Virginia Directory of Public Schools, the group that runs and regulates all of Virginia's schools, published a study, determining that 90% of schools offer extracurricular activities not only after school but also before school. In other words, most schools give students the option for out-of-school activities both before school and after. Due to that, extracurricular activities do not deprive students of time to complete their homework after school.\n\nUltimately, it should be required for students to take part in at minimum one extracurricular activity. Why? Participating in an out-of-school activity helps students become more socially involved, increases their self-esteems, and helps them find talent to become successful. If you're a student, participate in an extracurricular activity! If you're a teacher, start a new out-of-school club! It may seem small, but in the end, it might be what jump starts your future... or your whole life.",

    Essay: "Students should do what they love and not be forced to do extracurricular activity. Students have a lot to do after school, like babysitting, sports, chores and homework. If we say that students have to do an extracurricular activity, they would be slammed. Students would have no time for a social life. I'm going to give you reasons why students should not have to do extracurricular activities.\n\nIt would take away homework time. Schools and teachers do not let students have time in class to work on homework. Also everyone has four academic classes. On some nights homework could take up two hours or more. Students would not have time to get work done and then they could start failing classes.\n\nIt could make students sad and upset, and even maybe rebel. If students don't want to do something, they just quit. So if we make students do something they dislike they'll stop trying. It also may have students dislike school even more and start to not come, and get bad grades. Which would make the school students records look bad.\n\nSomeone might say that, it will allow students to make new friends. Making new friends is always a good idea. But what if those student were planing on seeing their friends. They wouldn't be able to because they had to do these extracurricular activities. Also their friends might not be in the same activity as them. Another argument would be that it would help students stop being so lazy. We have no idea of what their home life is like. What if after school they were supposes to watch their siblings. Or maybe was supposes to clean the house and do chores. It would take time out from helping their parents to do something the kid doesn't even want to do.\n\nAfter all the reasoning, students should not be forced to do something that they will not enjoy. From my own experience, I do not have time for these extracurricular activities. I already do a sport, my teachers give out homework, and sometimes I have to look after my younger brother. Students should be students. If teachers and staff want to make school fun for us than we should get to choose if we do extracurricular activities.",

Other thing is you can share you idea to the people and they will understand you. That why teachers put the activitys to us. However, there are some students that do not like to talk or do sports but at least we are having fun.

I disagree with what the principal said about every student participating in extracurricular activities because it could effect student's homework, family time, also it isnt fun for some students.\n\nStudents normally do there homework after school, or after they get done hanging out or playing games after school. With activities being after school, and homework being done after school, there wont be as much time as they normally have to finish it. Normally schools ends at 2:15, and after school activities end around 5, so doing after school would give students 3+ hours to do homework. If someone has to eat in that time, do chores, and maybe even play a few games, the person would not have a lot of time to do there homework. Thus there grade could drop from not doing there homework, or not having enough time to do there homework.\n\nSome families do stuff with each other when every member is at home and ready to go. If a student stays after and leaves around 5 they still have to either walk, ride a bus, or get picked up to go home. With this being the time families would be having dinner, and with the time they won't be able to go out after eating because it is bad to run around on a full stomach. Also with the time they might not be able to go out to eat either because, for me, it takes a while to get to the restaurant and then you have to decide what to eat. When it is the weekdays, from my knowledge, restaurants close from 6-8 pm and even then there time there will be shortened because they also have to eat before the restaurant closes then go home.\n\nLots of students hang out with there friends, or go home and start playing video games after school. Although, with after school activities they would have less time to play video games or hang out. Students can still hang out after school, even if that is correct some students don't do the same activities as there friends, or they just focused more on the activity. Focusing on the activity is the main things students have to do, if they goof around too much then they would get in trouble. Also some students don't like any of the after school activities, they aren't fun to them, which is why they dont do after school.\n\nHomework. family time, and fun, those are the reasons I disagree with having students do after school activities.

It's been six years since I started playing, and I'm still friends with everyone that was on my softball team. Extracurricular activities such as clubs, sports, and the student council can and will make a big impact on students. I agree that students should participate in extracurricular actives because, they teach students teamwork, help them gain social skills, and keeps them healthy and active.\n\nWhen students join an after school sport or club there will be others they may not know, playing on the same team. The first rule in teamwork is work as a team no matter what circumstances. The people on your team are the people that have your back at the end of the day. Even if you mess up in a game, practice, or a match, they are the people that going to tell you it's going to be okay. Even outside of school or practice, like the classroom you might have to do group work, and work as a team but you would already know how to. By doing extracurricular activities teaches students teamwork and will make students better at working as a team.\n\nJoining extracurricular activities will improve and/or teach students social skills. Like when they first get on the team or get into the club, with other students they will most likely don't know.

There's always going to be a group of people that already know each other so, they will have to speak up. Not only would it build their social skills but it will expand their friend group.\n\nAfter school sports and clubs will also help keep you healthy and active. Extracurricular activities like sports are usually everyday afrerschool about two hours. Sports like soccer or basketball will keep students running so they would be physically active and keep their heart healthy. Clubs like chess and student council students wouldnt be running but helps their mental health. Also both sports and clubs will boost mental health so much because you have friends you can talk to when your upset or going through anything.\n\nExtracurricular can help you so much not just by hanging out with friends but by, teaching students teamwork, help them gain social skills, and keeps them healthy and active.

    Essay: "All students must complete at least one extracurricular activity this year.\" Principal PROPER_NAME said over the intercom. PROPER_NAME said to himself,\"What is an extracurricular activity?\" He was lonely and all he did was munch on food after school. He needed an activity to do after school because he was always full of boredom. PROPER_NAME trudged up to the school club board to choose a club. Something caught his eye that he had never thought of trying, he could become a wrestler and have his own sport that he could be good at instead of eating. He started the sport and loved it then two years later he became the reigning state champ in his heavyweight class. Students in schools should participate in at least one extracurricular activity each year because it helps them find what they can be good at, it helps some kids make new friends, and sports that they provide for you can help you stay fit.\n\nTo begin, the main reason that it is good to do an extracurricular activity after school is that a student can find out what they could become good at if they tried and their talents that they have. For example, it should be required for students to do a sport so that maybe the school team could use some more talent or need one extra person to step up so that the team can play competitively against other schools. It would make the team better and more talented because it would be harder to make for some kids. If a kid does not make the team they can learn from it and try something different. Some kids need a sport so that if they are like PROPER_NAME they can find what they can become good at good at.\n\nSecondly, some kids don't have friends or could use some more friends. The students with little friends can do an extracurricular activity and become new friends with the kids that need friends. Extracurricular activities can help some students become more social so that they are not be quiet all the time. Parents of some kids work very late nights and they would have nobody watching their kids after school, this would be an advantage to having extracurricular activities as well. Some parents of kids cannot afford for their kid to do a sport but the good thing about extracurricular clubs and sports is that they are free and the parents would not have to buy anything for their kid to play a sport or be in a club. There are many varieties of clubs to choose from and all a kid has to do is find the club that would fit for them just right.\n\nLastly, some students that are not in shape and need to become physically fit. Sports can help you want to stay in shape and not just eat and eat all the time they can gain habits of eating healthier so that when they eat and eat they can make sur they are eating healthy. If you do track you run a lot at practices and if you do basketball you run up and down the court a lot this can all help you lose weight if you are out of shape. Being physically fit can prevent yourself from getting diabetes later in life, and it can also give you many advantages in life. Additionally, if you want to run a marathon when you get older and that is a personal goal for yourself, you won't be able to run a marathon if you are fat and out of shape. Being able to achieve some of your physical goals doesn't happen over night so this is why you should have to be forced to sign up for these extracurricular activities like a sport to achieve some of your goals.\n\nIn conclusion, everyone in schools should be required to do an extracurricular activity and find what they like and what talents they have through what extracurricular activities are offered at your school.\"I finally found what I am good at and I am not fat anymore!\" PROPER_NAME  said.\" Thank you Principal Warner for making me do an extracurricular activity, now I know what I am good at and the talent I have!\" Some extracurricular activities would look good on your resume for a job and would help you become successful in life. Doing something other than school is not a bad thing it will only help you and could with school as well. Students in schools should participate in at least one extracurricular activity each year because it helps them find what they can be good at, it helps some kids make new friends, and sports that they provide for you can help you stay fit.",

    Essay: "H: Have you ever had to balance school work, homework, a job, and multiple after school activities? If so then were you able to do it well? I think students having a mandatory extracurricular activity is a terrible idea, I think this because some students may have jobs after school, some may have to help their families, and some would have to do multiple activities.\n\nThe first reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students have a job after school. I have a friend that is trying to get a job and he would probably work everyday after school. When he gets home after school he world only have a few hours to get his homework done and get ready for work, since he would probably go straight to sleep when he got home after work and not have time to do his homework. If he also had an after school activity then he would have even less time to do his homework and get ready for his job. He would also be even more tired when he got home because he didn't have the few hours he would normally have to get some rest before he had to get ready.\n\nThe second reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students may have to help their families after school. Some students when they get home after school don't have a parent home to take care of their siblings so they would have to do it. They have to make food and make sure their siblings do what they are suppose to do be doing. If they had to have an extracurricular activity then they would get home later than their siblings. Their siblings would have time to do whatever they wanted before anyone got home. Then when they got home they would have to get their sibling back to what they are suppose to be doing. After that they would have to make food, clean up whatever their siblings were doing, do their homework, and any other work they may have to do.\n\nThe final reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some people would have to do multiple activities. If someone was already doing one activity but it wasn't created as a part of the school you go to then you would probably have to start a second activity and try to balance the two activities, schoolwork, homework and anything else that they have to do after school. If they are not able to balance everything then they would have to stop doing one of the activities, and it would probably have to be the activity that is not a part of the school. Also some students may be doing a sport and sports are only for part of the year so they would have to do multiple and the start and end dated for the sports may overlap. So they would be doing two and may miss practice or a game for one of them.\n\nIn conclusion I think that schools having a mandatory after school extracurricular activity is a terrible idea because some students may have jobs after school, some may have to help their family, and some would have to multiple activities. Some students would have to balance schoolwork, homework, the two activities, a job, families, and anything else they may have to do after school. All of that may be too much for some students and they could fall behind in their classes.",

You watch the clock's hand slowly move towards freedom, the end of the school day. Without extracurriculars to interrupt core classes like math, english, science, and history, the school day is long and tedious. Curriculum planned by the state can be confusing and boring, making kids stressed and unfocused mere hours into the day. It's hard to find time for hobbies with the mountains of homework given in classes that aren't chosen by kids. Designed to be fun and engaging, activities outside of the four main classes include things like band, orchestra, yearbook, sports, and more, depending on what different schools offer. Students should have to participate in extracurriculars during the school day because they can alleviate stress, make students socialize, and help kids find new interests.\n\nAfter test upon test upon test, extracurriculars give students a little bit of solace and time to relax. Classes, especially math and science, make students labor hard over textbooks and homework. Activities that students choose to take, like yearbook or student council, typically have little to no homework. These classes are more free form, a place that isn't so strict compared to core subjects. Because they're chosen subjects, not forced, they are also more fun for the children taking them. Students are always worrying about grades, which usually aren't a problem in extracurriculars because they are easy to earn as long as work is completed on time in class.\n\nNot every student is a social butterfly, but electives help them to reach out of their comfort zones. Required classes are usually silent, making it hard to make new friends. Electives help kids meet people who share the same interests as them. Even if a person is introverted, it's good to find someone who shares something in common with them. For students that already have friends in their classes, they can talk more and may even be allowed to sit next to each other, a privilege rare in core subjects.\n\nIf a student has a job to help support their family outside of the school day, then between homework and their work they don't have time to find new interests. Special classes during the school day create the time and space for students to explore new hobbies. These interests can lead kids to think about their futures and potential career options. For example, a student who works on the school newspaper can find great enjoyment in writing and can think about majoring in journalism. Activities like student council and speech and debate give kids a look into political jobs, which later in life they may want to pursue.\n\nStudents shouldn't be forced to do anything, but they still have free choice with extracurriculars because there are many different classes that they can elect to take. The next time you're asked if you support extracurriculars during the school day, say yes. These activities can be a great break from the school day, help people make new friends, and help kids find new interests.",

    Essay: "Just imagine, one day you're in the most boring class ever just waiting for the bell to ring so you can finally go home but it feels like forever. Just looking at the clock, next to the teachers desk every second just hoping for the time class dismisses you but you're going in slow motion. But the principal announces that every student in the school has to participate in a extracurricular activity and it puts a smile on your face because you now have something to look up too and school wont be boring anymore.\n\nIf your principal were to announce on the announcements that every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, would you agree that students should or not? I would say yes and i have two reasons why.\n\nMy first reason why this is a good idea is that students would be more active around the school. Take working on the school yearbook for example. by teacher permission students should walk around campus for quotes from the students, and students can draw the yearbook cover that supports the theme of the year and towards the end students can vote on the top five cover ideas. or they can sign up for clubs for fun, for example: chess club, Art club, Band club, Dance lessons, and school plays. or they can sign up for student council and participate in the parts of a school principal and monitor the school.\n\nSecond supporting reason is students can also participate in after school sports. If kids were to participate in sports activities they would have better health and be more physically fit and also make new friends and just all in all have fun. Students can also tryout for the school teams and begin an athletic career for themselves, and if they were to work hard enough and enjoy the sport their playing, it could possibly lead to a professional career. Another reason for this claim if for students to enjoy themselves after a stressful day of work, tests, and final exams, then after school students can spend an hour or two destressing by playing sports and have fun with friends. And at the end of the day students would be exhausted and would rest well for the next day.\n\nMy counter claim for why this idea is not good is because, student grades can fall from the lack of focus from these activities. I say this because students usually lose track on what they're supposed to do than what they want to do. Another reason for this counter claim is, students would not only lose focus on their school work but they'd also most likley not follow directions around school in hallways or in class.\n\nAll in all I support this idea and these are my reasons whhy I support it, and not only that this helps kids be more active and fit, this also helps boosting social skills and making new friends and possibly change how the school functions around students.",

    Essay: "I disagree with the principal saying that we should have at least one extracurricular activity. It's beacause students struggle with school and forcing them to keep using their brain for no good reason at all. We need time to relax and I also disagree with the principal for other reasins to. It's also more work for teachers. I don't know if even the county board would agree with the principal.\n\nStudents would hate this in my opinion. Also the brain has it's own schedule to work. By adding more time to that schedule it could mess up the human body and tire out the brain. Students are here to learn not to participate in extracurricular activities. I know some students would want to participate. So that's why I said it should be a option and not be forced to partcipate so students can get there way. Also if a student is behind in any work at school,forcing the student to participate would put more weight on his back. So in clunclusion to this paragraph I think the students would disagree with the principal.\n\nTeachers work so hard to grade,make test,plan and help all the students. So by making the teachers work more by making them teach the extracurricular activitys would also tire out there brain. Even if they didn't make them teach the activitiys it would stll affect the teachers. When the students brain is tired out it stops listening and it makes the student stop foucusing which makes it harder for the teacher to teach. So in conclusion to this paragraph I also think the teachers would disagree with the principal.\n\nSo to finish this off I think the principal is out of its mind and before deciding the principal should consult with the teachers and the students. Sometimes whatever you think is the best for people really could be the exact oppisite.\n\nAlso the principal would have to do more work because the principal would somehow have to fit it in our schedule. By doing this it would just make everyones life harder. So in conclusion to this I,maybe the teachers and maybe everyone else wouldn't agree with the prompt.",

    Essay: "Can you believe that on average 60% of students do not participate in an after school activity? I know I can, I'm apart of that 60%. Can you also believe that the principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Now this is unbelievable, many students, including myself, are extremely busy and simply don't have time to stay after school. It's hard trying to juggle schoolwork, social life, family life, and personal problems, let alone adding one more ball to your juggling circus act by staying after school. I know that staying after school and participating in extracurricular activities can have many benefits, like finding new interests and making new friends, but many students don't have the possibility to stay after school due to their busy schedules. I completely disagree with the principal that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity due to the fact that some students are busy and don't have time, others participate in other activities outside of school, and it would cost the school more money to fund the activities.\n\nOne reason why I disagree with the principal about staying after school is that many students don't have the opportunity to stay after school due to them being busy outside of school. Many students have commitments and responsibilities outside of school, such as going to work,or taking care of a younger sibling, which serve as an impediment and prohibits the student from staying after school. If these students were demanded by the principal that they have to stay after school, then these students would end up losing not only their jobs, but the trust and responsibilities their bosses and parents have put for them as well. Many students do not like the idea of staying after school due to the fact that it would cause more stress on them by trying to keep up with school, work, after school, family life, etc. From all the stress they would be receiving it could cause a toll on their mental health as well as their physical health, and could cause them to do poorly in school, as well as in other areas of their life. I know parents would not want this for their children, and would not want for them to risk their jobs, responsibilities, and especially their health all for an extra activity after school that they are too busy for.\n\nLike the students who are busy, there are many students that can not participate in an extracurricular activity after school because they are already participating in other activities outside of school. Many students participate in sports, where they are in a club or league and they have to make it to practice or compete in tournaments after school. Other students go to academies for tutoring so they can get extra help in school, or to enhance their learning and advance in their studies. Some students also participate in different programs offered by the community, such as Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Girls and Boys Club, music programs, environmental programs,etc. Typically these programs have meetings almost everyday which members of these clubs have to attend. In many cases students are in more than one of these activities after school that take up almost all their time, and therefore they cannot commit to any more after school activities.\n\nNot only would staying after school for an extracurricular activity affect the students, but it would also affect the school as well as the school's budget due to the fact that the school will need to spend more money to fund all of the activities. The more sports and activities the school offers and needs to add to fit everyone in at least one activity, the more the school will have to spend on adding activities as well as any equipment needed for those activities. Not to mentions with all these activities we need experienced teachers and coaches to assess with all the students and run the activities. With teachers having to stay after school they would have to get paid for those extra hours they have worked. You also have to take into consideration transportation. How are the students going to get home after school? Many parents are still busy working and might not have time to pick their child up, others might not even have a car. Yes, you can get enough buses to transport everyone back home, but more after school buses means spending more money on drivers and buses. With all this money being spent for after school there won't be enough money to spend and fund activities for the actual school day, which in my opinion more important than after school.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the principal that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because some students are busy and don't have time, others participate in other activities outside of school, and it would cost the school more money to fund activities. The principal needs to take into consideration these reasonings and consider the viewpoints and opinions of students, staff, and administrators to change their decision on making everyone stay after school, and instead change their proposal so it can fit everyone's needs.",

    Essay: "Should students be forced to take an extracurricular activity? I don't take they should for many reasons. Taking extracurricular activities can increase work and responsibility, take time away from more important areas, or even cause stress. A student should only take an extracurricular activity if they know that they'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can negatively affect the student in many ways.\n\nTaking an extracurricular activity means more work, and considering the amount of work students already have, it can be overwhelming. Many students won't be able to complete all their assignments because of the extra activity. This can lead to lower grades and worst performance in other classes. Not only will students have more work, they will also have to manage their time in order to be able to consistently participate or show up for that activity.\n\nYou might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong, but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. When students take extracurricular activities, they take away from their free time in order to put it in their schedule. Students use their free time to do their homework, relax from work, or spend with their family. This is pretty important for a student, considering that this may stress them out. This leads into our final reason.\n\nThe increased amount of work and responsibility, combined with managing time efficiently, can be enough to overwhelm student to the point where they get stressed. Students might not be able to keep up with all the work they get from their extracurricular activity plus all their other classes. As stated before, this can lower grades, and force students to take time away from those classes just to focus on their extracurricular activity. Stress is very serious problem already, and it can be beneficial not to force a student to participate in an activity that they don't want to do.\n\nIn conclusion, taking an extracurricular activity can have negative affects. It starts with unnecessary work, which leads to taking time away from other things, which finally leads to stress. Many students already do extracurricular activities, mainly because they enjoy it. But some students need time to focus on other things they might find more important, which isn't a bad thing. Students shouldn't be forced to join an activity, but they should always have the option to.",

I dont think that the principal can force kids to take an extracurricular activity, that just adds to their schedule. Adding another class or activity can make kids not want to go to school. I think that the principal's decision is bad because, Most kids already have activities that take up the whole day. If the person is bad at sports and art for the yearbook they shouldnt have to do it. If they don't like the activities then they shouldn't be forced to go.\n\nCertain kids have chosen a lot of classes for the school year that take up the whole day. Or just have too much work or after school things to add another thing to do. For example majority of kids take honor role, or advanced classes. Secondly some people just have trouble with their classes, and adding another extracurricular activity can mess up their schedule or make it harder for them. Lastly most kids wouldn't even have time to do an extra class, along with their other classes. So how would they fit it in their schedule?\n\nSome kids find some activities hard to do. Then they couldnt be able to add and extracurricular activity to their schedule. For instance sports, their is that one group of kids that are either nonathletic or just bad in general. Secondly a lot of kids are just bad at art and cant figure out how to properly paint or draw. Finally if forced to do an activity that can be hard for them, can make going to school not fun. If they cant do the activity, and find it hard, that would just make the whole school year harder for them.\n\nWhat if the kids do not like the activities? Then what would they do? If the kids do not like any of the activities then they wouldn't want to go to any of them. For instance if the person finds the activity boring they wouldn't want to go to it, and try to find a way out. Next if some kids hate sports or art, then they would be stuck in a class that they hate or don't know what to do all year long. Lastly maybe the person is just is bad at it, then they would just not like it, and hate it every time they had to go to the class.\n\nI dont agree because most kids do not have time for it, or they could just be bad at the activity and shouldn't be forced to go to it. If people dont like the extracurricular activities then they shouldnt be forced to go. So then the principals decision is not called for, and not necessary. If they add another activity to the day it would just stress out people, and everyone would just dislike school. What if you do not want to do it? Do you even have enough time?

    Essay: "Our school principle is trying to decide whether he should make every student participate in a extracurricular activity, well we can't let that happen, here s why. School is all about learning, and having fun well how can a student have fun in school when their principle is making them do something they don't want to do. Schools all about respecting others, yourself, and property. making somebody do something they don't like. or want is not respecting them at all. Maybe that person doesn't want to do this activity, because they don't have many friends in it, or don't know a lot of people.\n\nthis reason is pretty obvious about why this school should not make this rule, students would get less work/homework time. especially a activity involving daily meetings like sports, and school plays those require practice everyday until later times like 6 for most people. A person may not want to do these activity also like track, football, soccer, and field hockey, because they may think they're not good enough at it, or may even think think they're not a good type of person for this sport. If that happens then that person would feel less about themselves, and wouldn't enjoy it. I'm sure the principle doesn't want that to happen, so why put this rule here?\n\nIt's not just the students that are telling you \"no\" to this rule. Even the parents don't like it. I'm sure every parent should want everything good for their kids, and would do anything to make them happy. well if the kids aren't happy then i'm sure the parents aren't happy either. using this rule to make a student do a extra curricular activity would create more stress on the parent too. The parents would have to be the one's to pick up their kids, and drop them off to something. Like a school play they have rehearsal almost every day. Well the parent would have to be able to pick them up from that, because clearly some of the students aren't even allowed to drive yet.\n\nSo obviously this rule wouldn't help the school, it would make things worse. Students might think school is fun if they can make their own decisions about extra curricular courses which may include band, sports, chorus, strings, school play, or clubs. This rule would make no sense, and many people would not enjoy it. Some people may even go to another school. These are only one of many good choices as to why the school shouldn't have this extra curricular rule, but these reasons that you sound pretty good, and are really good reasons.",

    Essay: "Why Students Should do a Extra Curricular Activity\n\nHave you ever been stressed and need something to clear your mind? That is why students should be required to do at least one extra curricular activity. Extra curricular activities is a great opportunity that every kid should be required to do because it lets you take your mind of of school and do something that you enjoy with your friends.\n\nExtra curricular activities are a great way to meet new people and practice life skills. I moved to a school this year and I new very few people, but then I joined a extra curricular activity and I met a lot of people. This also means that people from a grade can still hang out with someone from a different grade level. Meeting people gives you great life skills because you learn how to greet people and you learn how to be more social and less shy. This means that people meet a lot of new people and they learn a lot about each other. You also learn their points of view. You learn a lot of different perspectives on how to fix certain problems that our would is facing. With all of those points of views, you can learn the best ways to fix the problems. Some people may say that you can do that outside of an extra curricular activity, but that is wrong because if you go to the grocery store you would not stop every one that is going down the isle and talk to them for 30 minutes. If you were a part of an extra curricular activity, you would have the chance to talk longer because you are with them after school for a long time.\n\nExtra curricular activities are also a great way to do something that you enjoy. I joined a extra curricular activity and I am always exited to go there after school and have fun. I love doing it and I would not be able to do it at home. This means that I have a lot of fun doing what I love with new friends that I can hang out with. It also lets you not stress over school and think about something happy and exiting. Some people may say that anything you do at the school you can do at home, but that is not true because some people that go to the public schools can not afford it and even If you did, you would still need to bring people to your house to play it. If you did bring people over to do that it would be the same thing as having it at you school, but worse because it is less convenient and the school pays for the equipment. If you did it at your house you would have to pay. Some parents can not even pick their kids up until a little later so it gives them something fun to do. That is why it is a great way to do something that you enjoy.\n\nExtra curricular activities should also be enforced because it lets people try new things that they may not be able to do at home. It is always good to try new things because you do not know if you like it. You may be really good at it, but you never know until you try. If you hate that extra curricular activity than their are a lot more and I am sure that you will find some that you really love and enjoy. This means that you find something you love and can connect to other people that love that activity as well. Some people may say that you can connect with people that do not do an extra curricular activity, but that is not true because it would be very hard to ask a lot of people what they love to do outside of school. If you do an extra curricular activity, it would be a lot easier to connect and you may end up being great friends at school and maybe even in the future. It is a lot easier to make connections and get to know each other if you spend a lot of time together.\n\nStudents should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities. Extra curricular activities lets kids try new things that they may love. Extra curricular activities also lets you meet new people. Students should defiantly be forced to participate in extra curricular activities. Extra curricular activities lets you take your mind of off school and it lets you hang out with friends.",

    Essay: "The school has decided that everyone must participate in an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be almost anything. It is a wide range of activities, from being on a sports team to drawing objects in the classroom. Therefore, I think students should participate in an extracurricular activity.\n\nFirstly, students who don't know what they enjoy now may find something they will enjoy in the future. Being a teenager is when you find out what you are defined by. Are you a sports person? Do you like geography? Do you like computers? An extracurricular activity, like a computer club, would be where one decides if they like computers. This can help them decide what to do with their future, as the person found out if they want to continue with computer science, or if they think computer science is not their thing.\n\nSecond, this can help students decide what to do later in life. If one were in a geography club and enjoyed it, then they will likely be interested in the field of geography. They will likely study geography in college and get a job in that field. It can also decide what hobbies the students may enjoy as adults. They can find people who have the same hobby or interest, and meet some new people.\n\nAn extracurricular activity also looks better on a college application. Nowadays, colleges and universities look into what you do after school. Do you do extracurricular activities or do you just do school? They would be looking for what extracurricular activities you did in middle or high school. If you did some activity after school, you will have a slightly higher chance of making it into a university or college. They will think, \"Wow, Generic_Name did a lot of extracurricular activities. He was on the student council, in the geography and maps club, and into theater. That looks great!\", if you did activities after school.\n\nIn the end, students should be required to do an extracurricular activity. They can decide what they may enjoy in the future. This leads to what they may want to major in while in university, and what career path they want a job in. Universities also look at what you did after school. If you did something after school, it would look better on your application. This is why students should do an extracurricular activity.",

Extracurricular activities shape peoples lives, which is why I will be explaining why everybody should try at least one activity.\n\nFirstly, extracurricular activities allow us to learn new things which we can use later on in our lives. These activities spark new hobbies and interests which shed some joy on life. Their are a variety of activities around the world which lead to a vast amount of things people can learn including, a language, a new sport, or a musical instrument.

Extracurricular activities show we can handle multiple things at once, which allows employers to know you can handle the work they give you.

Many students participate in activities outside of school, which can cause their schedule to be pretty tight, and that's not even counting homework. Some may barely have enough time to transition between school and any other activity they may have. So if someone made it mandatory for students to join a club or team, they would have to drop another activity, which they might feel really passionate about.\n\nSchools tend to offer many activities, but they don't offer all of them. As a result, there will be students who just aren't interested in any of them. Many may feel it's best not to waste their time on something they won't enjoy. So making students participate in an activity may cause them to not feel motivated in whatever they're doing, which can bring the whole team or group down. If a student is forced into an activity they don't enjoy, they wont want to do much with the group/team.\n\nIf schools force students to join a team or club, they might feel like their free will has been stripped away from them. Many students today can get upset really quickly. Students may want to rebel and skip the meetings/practices. They may even get angry and try to shut the whole idea down, or rant on social media. Forcing students to do extracurricular activities can cause them to get even more homework, which can really effect their mental health, depending on the situation.\n\nOverall, forcing students to do extracurricular actives is a bad idea because they wont have enough time, may not want to do any of the activities, or even get angry. Schools should stay the way they are, and only offer the activities and not force them. Even if it may seem like a good idea to make extracurriculars mandatory at first, it wont take long for it to backfire.",

    Essay: "Oh my god\", said Generic_Name. \"Im too stressed from all the homework and tests, I can't do these extracurricular activities\". Me too, I said. This is too much work for us. \"How am I supposed to study for my test, If I have to do these activities\", Said Generic_Name. This is causing too much stress and anxiety among students, I said. \"Look at all of classmates, they all look so tired from all these activities\". I agree Its just too much for these students to handle all at once. This is also causing less effort on tests and other stuff. Which can also lead too worse grades and a bad mood among the students. \"My parents are gonna be mad at me now because of my grades\"! I agreed my grades aren't looking the best too. We should tell the principal about this. Students shouldn't participate in any extracurricular activities because it causes too much stress and anxiety, worse grades, and from all the stress causes a bad mood.\n\nFirst, extra activities are causing too much stress and anxiety for students. Stress is becoming a huge problem in schools. For example my friend Generic_Name had stress from all these activities and now he won't even talk to anyone. Anxiety is also becoming a huge problem in schools. Another example is my brother had so activities to do after school it gave him anxiety and stress that his grades became terrible. Stress can eventually lead to depression which isn't good for anyone. For example my friend will had depression form school and the stress now he has to go to therapy. Overall extra activities cause these issues and aren't good for everyone.\n\nNext, From activities students grades are getting worse. Grades are a huge priority for students. For instance my cousin had so many activities to do his parents got mad because of his low grades in school. Low grades will impact your future. Another example my sister had low grades because she had to time to fix them had to stay after school. Low grades will make you have a bad appearance. Last example is my classmate Generic_Name had very low grades form his extra activities that no one wanted to be friends with him. In the end extra activities result in low grades for students.\n\nLast, the stress form activities will make you more frustrated and have a bad mood. Being frustrated would lower your effort and your grades. My classmate Generic_Name was so stressed and frustrated she didn't want to do anything in school. Having a bad mood would make you lose friends and get into fights easily. Next example my brother Generic_Name was so mad and stressed he didn't want to talk to anyone and he ended up losing a lot of friends. Too much frustration might lead to depression. Last example my cousin Generic_Name was frustrated from these activities he almost had depression. At the end being stressed and being frustrated is not good for the student.\n\n\"Im so happy\", said Generic_Name. I can't believe the principal said yes I said. \"Now we don't have to be worried about our grades\", said Generic_Name. \"No more being stressed about your grades\"! I agreed now we have much more time to study and learn. Extra activities cause too much stress and anxiety among students. We don't have to be worried about these activities anymore.",

    Essay: "Did you know that it is now mandatory to join an extracurricular? We already have so much to do in the little time we have after school, now we have to spend more time on a extracurricular. Students should not be forced to join an extracurricular because most students are to busy and dont have the time, others may not like the extracurriculars offered at the school,or may not be able to join because they dont want to stay in the school environment for longer than they have to.\n\nLots of students will not have the time to join an extracurricular and may have to quit other activities. Older students may have jobs to go to and then spend the rest of their time studying for school. Studying for school alone already takes up so much time for a successful students day. If they have to join an extracurricular than they will be under too much stress since the lack of free time and will have an even tighter schedule. A study at Harvard shown that 76% of students are under so much stress and 34% will develop negative effects such as depression, anxiety, or tiredness and it will effect their grade. Other students that have more time on their hands, most likely already are in clubs outside of school that involve the community, such as Girl/Boy Scouts, religious groups, environment groups, or private sports teams. If students will forced into extracurricular groups there is a chance that they will have to quit one of their activities to make time for the extracurricular activity.\n\nIf the students will forced into extracurricular groups there will be students that dont find any activity fun or amusing. The students were a part of outside school groups but had to quit because of time management, will probably not find interest in groups the school has to offer because they were not like other groups. Some students will probably find these groups a waste of time. Students at other schools will be able to join more outside school clubs specifically for them, while students here will be forced to join some club they will not find interesting and probably useless. Yes, there will be students that do not mind this new rule, but others will not get the same fun experience, instead they may end up disliking the principle and school.\n\nSome students may not want to join an extracurricular because they dont want to be in the school environment than longer than they have to. More introverted students would not want to join an extracurricular because they are tried and want to go back home were they can spend their time freely and independently. It would be good to have lots of student participation and school spirit, however it should be at will and not something mandatory of students to do if they dont feel comfortable. Eventually students will find it very irritating that they have to be in extracurricular and will try to find an excuse or way to quit. Forcing students to join an extracurricular will not give out a positive effect on the school and its reputation. Its better to have student that feel passionate about an extracurricular than students that dont want to be there and just want the school day to end.\n\nStudents should not be forced to join extracurricular because they will not get a positive school experience from it. Joining an extracurricular will get more school spirit and students may learn new thing, however it should not be mandatory and nobody will get anything positive from force. We must tell our principle that this new rule is outrageous and should be changed, instead have more school assemblies or let students speak their mind at school more. If the school just pushes ans pushes this new pressure on us it will end with students feeling more stressed, more irritated at the school, and feel like they are more trapped. I do not agree with this decision and as a student I can tell that this will not have a positive effect on me or my peers.",

    Essay: "The students should participate in a extracurricular activity because they would become more social and make new friends. If a student that is anti-social has to go to an extracurricular activity they get to talk to more people and make more friends. Students will spend less time on electronics all day and spend more time with friends. Students will also have more fun and more time to hangout with their friends if they don't have time any other day. I agree with the principal because everyone will be participating from something at school like sports or school council, and students would become more interactive with people while making new friends.\n\nEveryone will be participating from something at school like sports, school council, and academic help. All the people that play sports will play sports with friends and having fun. Students that need help on a subject that they are struggling on can go to their teachers for help on the subject. The students from the school council can think of more ideas on how to help the school and make it better. Whatever activity that the students are doing will have them spend more time with their friends at school. Students can also do their homework at school and if they need help they can just go to their teacher, or interact more with other people\n\nStudents will become more interactive because they get to spend more time with other people at school. They will have more time to hang out and have fun with their friends. They're going to spend less time on electronics and interact more in real life with more people. When they make new friends from there extracurricular activity they will become more interactive and make even more friends. They're going to become more social and interact with more people because of the extracurricular activity. Making friends will make the students more interactive with each other and they will talk more.\n\nAfter all the points that I have included I still agree with the principal because students will become more interactive and every student will be participating from something at school. The students will also make new friends and become more social. Students will either have fun or learn something or do even both during their activity.",

    Essay: "It's 9pm, you haven't finished your homework. You would've finished your homework, if you had the choice to go straight home. However, the extra curricular you have to participate in, took too much time. That's the view of a student, if they would have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Students would have no time to play their Xbox, and have no time to finish that 8 paragraph essay, if they had to participate in a extracurricular activitiy. I don't agree that students should be forced to take one extracurricular activity, because it makes students do something they don't like, makes students have no time for homework, and does not allow students to go home and have time to breath.\n\nExtracurricular activities, are for people who want to be in that activity, or feel interested in it. If student's aren't interested in that activity, then why should they be forced to do it? How would you feel if you had to be on the basketball team but you don't even like basketball?\n\nExtracurricular activities would also make students stay up at 10pm to finish their homework. They would make students more overwhelmed with homework, because the extracurricular activitiy would take too much of their time. Lastly, if students had to take a extracurricular activitie, students wouldn't get a break from school. Students want to get out of stressful school, and go home, but the extracurricular activitie abolishes that opportunity.\n\nIn conclusion, if the principal forced students to do extracurricular activities, it would make students more stressed out then they should be. If students don't like the activity they have to do, why do they have to take that activity? The poor students wouldn't have time to breath, and go home. Students relaxing time would be school time, so which one do you choose? Forcing students to live under school, or allow students to have their own life after school, with no consequences.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities can be fun, but not particularly when students are being forced to participate. Making students participate in something more than school can be very stressful. A lot of students enjoy playing sports or being in a yearbook club, but when everyone is forced to participate in something it loses that fun element. Some reasons why making students participate in extracurricular activities are, they could be doing other sports, they could have homework to do, or they can't fit it in their busy schedule.\n\nStudents may be filling their time with playing sports, and not have enough time to get participate in another activity.\n\nA lot of students play sports, for their school or a rec team, and having more to pile onto their schedule is stressful. Sports are hard enough as it is, and to add to that also still having to participate in an extra activity can mess up your flow. Having to balance not only one extra thing outside of school, but two, can be very stressful. Too much stress can cause you to possibly mess up on your team, and get kicked off that team.\n\nStressing doesn't help you, it does the exact opposite. Stressing about that after school activity you have to participate in doesn't help you when you get home and have to do homework. Homework is already hard enough not being able to focus, but with this new activity you have to do, it'll be harder. Having harder homework due to stress can cause you to get bad grades, and could lead to you failing that class. Most likely when you get home from practice, or another activity, you're tired and don't feel like sitting down and doing homework. But not doing your homework, can cause you to fail that class, which possibly means you get kicked off the sports team, and having to do better in school.\n\nSome children don't do any extra activities because their schedule is busy and they can't fit it in. Some students don't have any activity that interests them, and others just like to stay focused on schoolwork. The students who already do something extra, might not be able to do anything else. Nowadays kids want to have good grades, so they can go to their dream school. Already doing something and then having to do another activity on top of homework, won't help you get into your dream school.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that for the students sake, there shouldn't be a rule implying that you have to do any extracurricular activities, if they want the students grades to be high. Having to deal with the stress levels is going to cause the students overall grades to be low. Either having to already deal with sports, homework, or not having enough time in your day to do anything else, I think that the students should have a choice if they want to do anything else. I think letting the students have a choice would be wise because then if they mess up their grades it's not the schools fault.",

    Essay: "I agree with the principal that every student should participate in an extracuricular activity becuase, students should have more oppurtunities to broaden their minds and be open to new experiences. Especially, experiences that are beyond what basic school curriculum touches on. Students are also able to meet others that share common interests through extracurricular activities.\n\nForemost, extrcurricular activites are usually very positive environments where students can enjoy themselves without the pressure of school and other issues. For students that may have family problems, these activities may be their escape where they can indulge into what they enjoy doing. If students spend their time in a healthy, fun environment, they're much more likely to be overall happier people and probably perfom better in school.\n\nAnother reason why extracurricular activites should be an essential for students is that usually, whether the activty is a sport or some type of club, the school curriculum probably won't cover that topic as much because it has it's own standards it needs to follow. So, in turn, students should participate in activities that interest them because these activities will encourage them to think more deeply, widen their minds, and create new experiences for themselves that they would not get a chance to experience if they never did anything outside of school.\n\nMany students that may be more on the introverted side could also thrive in extracuricular activities since they will have the chance to meet other students that share common interests as them or else, they wouldn't have chosen the same activity. When students already enjoy what they're doing with their free time it's only more beneficial if they have the chance to express their feelings about it with other people that unerstand what they're talking about since they also participate in that activity.\n\nLastly, very many children in our generation are going to be familiar to a world constantly on their electronics. Although you can't change the modernization of civilization, students should take this time while they're still young and have more time for themselves to join extracurricular activites for the sole purpose of learning more of what interests them. Taking what they have learned in these activites will definetly help them in some way shape or form in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, I do believe that extracuricular activities should be part of students' day to day life because the experiences they're getting, they probably will not recieve anywhere else. Activites are a wonderful way for students to spend their time and possibly help them in real life situations when they grow up. Through the helpful and friendly environment, students will work to achieve the fullest potential in their activities.",

    Essay: "Extracirricular activites, they are fun. However, they end up being less enjoyable when you're forced into it. I don't believe that forcing students to participate in something they despise, or are otherwise uninterested in, is a clever idea. The main reasons behind this statement are that some students may have responsibilities outside of school, the quality and enjoyment for other members will be lessened or the overall product will suffer, and the students' grades could drop substancially.\n\nFirstly, some students have requirements outside of school. If students have to give up free time for a club they didn't want to do, their other responsibilities will end up rushed and messy. Homework, a job, music lessons, horse back riding lessons, tutoring and many more, are examples of responsibilities and interests that may need to be dropped in worst case scenario, and given less attention in best case scenario. Very few students will manage to juggle all of that, so ultimately, something will slip or be dropped.\n\nNext, the quality of the final product or overall enjoyment could be made much less by having people in the club who don't care and don't want to be there. For the yearbook committee, if you have people that don't want to do anything, the people who actually put forth effort will feel more stressed or pressured, and as a result, the final product won't be as good. In clubs like Chess club, people might not try because they don't care. They just signed up for it because they had to. Once again, having people who don't care about the club in a place where you came to enjoy yourself and be around likeminded individuals can be extremely disheartening. Being forced into something that you hate doing will also cause you to not put forth as much effort as would be required normally.\n\nFinally, a student's grades could slip dramatically. This happens for several reasons, they no longer care, they're having a hard time with the material, or they simply don't have time. If you require students to participate in an extracirricular activity they could spend time that they really need for studying, doing something that they don't want to do in the first place. A few problems come as the result of this, if it's highschool, maybe they'd have a harder time getting into collage. Their parents will most likely be upset with them as a result of slipping grades, which can cause tension between them, and result in personal stress seeping into school life. Not to mention, if they start to fight and argue with their parents all the time, and then feel like a failure in their afterschool activity as well as with their grades, that level of stress could lead them to depression, self harm, and even suicidal ideations.\n\nIn conclusion, causing students to potentially drop out of activites they enjoy, lowering club enjoyment for people who actually care, and causing stress that could possibly lead to mental issues or even death, is too many cons to risk implementing this change, and the change should be taken back immidiately. If you are a principal reading this and wondering if you should implement the policy, I truly hope that you think about the potential consequences of your action, before you see any of these risks take effect.",

    Essay: "Have you ever felt like you don't know anyone or don' t really have a hobby? Extracurricular activities can change that. Many people have found their passion and have continued on and have become very successful because of a club or activity they were in as a student. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the opportunity to make new friends, discover new interests and cure their after school boredom.\n\nFirstly, getting students involved in an extracurricular activity will help them to make new friends and meet new people. This can help students make friends with a similar interests. For example, one of the most beloved country music duos of all time, Brooks and Dunn, met through extracurricular activities. In 6th grade, the two joined a club called FFA and fell in love with it. Their FFA chapter had a bus for the members when they went on trips. The old, rusty bus had no radio. A couple close friends of the boys had saw them sing in church before and suggested they sing on the trips because of the broken radio in the bus. The boys agreed and sang all sorts of country songs for the members as they traveled. The boys had such a passion for singing what was on the radio that they figured they would produce songs for the radio. Now, they are both millionaires and travel to sing all across the world.\n\nIn addition to making new friends, extracurricular activities sprout interest in other hobbies. In 1988, a mother signed her child up for music club because she was working late and didn' t want her daughter at home by herself. Little did she know, her daughter would be one of the most famous singers in history. Her daughter was the worldwide phenomenon, Taylor Swift. Taylor was a shy kid. Though she had a passion for music, she was to scared to sing in front of people. While being in music club, Taylor gained enough confidence to sing in church. While singing in church, a record label producer was there and signed her to his label. She is now producing music and make millions of dollars.\n\nLastly, extracurricular activities give students something to do when they get home, after school. Some students come home and immediately turn on the TV or play video games, instead of exercising or doing their homework. If it wasn't for a policy at J.K Rowling' s school would would not have the many great books we have today. Her freshman year of high school she entered book club. She gained a love and passion for science fiction books and decided to start writing them. Many of her books have been turned into movies and she is now one of the most successful authors of all time.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities are very beneficial to our students in many ways. They can help our students be successful in our future careers.\n\nI believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the wonderful opportunities like making new friends, discovering new interests and giving kids something to do after school. These can help students in many ways and help us develop a successful future generation.",

Kids like to play games a lot now a days so I think after school activities wold be perfect so they wont ruin there brain.\n\nfirst reason I think people Should do after school activities is because it helps kids parents out and it help the children out because they wont be distracted or bothered with games or getting in trouble. A lot of kids just sit in the house and play videos all and all its doing is ruining peoples brain its no point of sitting on a games for hours and its not helping you out in the long run. Games are making most kids who love sports and have a talent at sports sitting in the house and at junk food all day and not take baths every day. This is just the beginning why kids should do after school activities.\n\nSecond reason kids should do after school activities is because they can help kids prepare for future jobs and future sports they wanna play they might not be better than playing a game all day or hanging with your friends all day but its worth a shot. Not everyone thinks staying after school is cool or fun but its okay to be different from your peers or friends its all ways to try some new.

They can also help you be more responsible. More students should do more extracurricular activities to have more opportunities and have a chance to try things they have never done before.\n\nBeing social and having friends is a big part of middle school and high school.

    Essay: "Having extracurricular activities is bad for students because it consumes time, makes students more tired and frustrated, wastes money.\n\nIf schools were to require extra activities, their reputation would decrease from the story behind it. The shocking truth behind having school activities may surprise you.\n\nPicture it, you're on your favorite sports team and you have a big game this afternoon and you can't wait much longer to go. Then, it suddenly hits you! You realize that you have an extracurricular school activity, all you do is just hope your team does well and win while you're at the activity. That's the case for most people. The main problem is that it's time consuming, especially for after-school activities. Students usually have to balance a lot with school with all of the homework and projects. School activities don't help with that at all. In fact, it even does the exact opposite. A lot of excuses at school are about how busy they are and why they couldn't complete their homework. With school activities, the grades will drop for sure from all of the uncompleted homework.\n\nAfter a long day of school, wouldn't you already be tired enough? It's very important for children to get a good rest or break. A lot of people get tired during the school day, so a school activity will surely not help it. When people are tired, they don't have interest in anything, and a school activity would make it worse, causing boredom. The lack of interest one has will most likely make their parents go up in flames from the money they wasted on it.\n\nMost activities are boring according to most students, so if the school would try to do something more entertaining, it would require more money. More money will cause bigger projects on the school which is just a waste of time. Money isn't only just effecting the school, but students as well. The price of activities are expensive, and will most likely just go to a waste. Sometimes students attempt to skip the activities to avoid all of the borringness which wastes their money a whole ton, and parents are not going to be happy about that.\n\nOverall, students should not be required to do extracurricular activities from tall the effects that can happen on them. Not doing activities can save them from a lot, and it's very important we keep that way. I'm sure nobody enjoys failing grades, just from doing these activities. If the school doesn't' require extracirricular activities it can keep pushing it's way forward by raising the reputation of it.",

    Essay: "The principal has made a decision saying all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I do not agree with this decision. The principal should not be able to decide what students must do after school. For example, many students have things they must do after school and if the principal requires students to do extracurricular activities after school, they might not be able to complete what they need to do. So, I do not think the principals decision to require students to do extracurricular activities is the right decision because students may have homework they need to complete, they may have chores to do at home, or they may have a job such as babysitting or dog walking.\n\nEvery student has at least one teacher that gives them homework. Some students have multiple teachers that give them homework. Either way, you need to complete what your teacher assigns you. If students are required to do an extracurricular activity, they might not have time to complete all their homework. This may cause students to get behind in there classes and when the time for a test comes they might not be prepared because of the lack of practice. If students start failing there classes and getting behind in work, they may never catch up or have a extremely difficult time catching up. If students care about school they would stress about being behind or failing a certain class. They wouldn't have time to hang out with friends or have a social life because they would just be sitting at home studying or trying to catch up in school.\n\nA lot of kids have chores to do. These chores may include: washing the dishes, doing the laundry, taking out the trash, or cleaning the house. Some kids have one chore to complete, some kids have multiple. Whatever the chore may be, kids should always be completing the task they are required to do. If students are required to do extracurricular activities they might not have enough time to complete their chores. If students have multiple chores to do, it might take them a couple hours to complete. If students get home later then they would normally, they would have less time to complete the task at hand. If students don't have enough time to complete these chores they might not be done correctly or they may have to stay up late doing them. When students have to stay up late they might be tired, or not focused the next day at school. If students are not focused they wouldn't be able to complete their work or learn very efficiently. So as you can see, not having time to do chores could lead to many bad outcomes.\n\nMoney is something that many kids would like to have more of. Some kids have a job such as dog walking or babysitting. Some kids make money for their own benefit, some kids make money to help with their college tuition. Not all people are born into a wealthy family. Many families struggle financially and their child working after school and making money may make a difference and help out his or her family a lot. Either way, kids need time to do their job. If students have to take time out of there day to do a extracurricular activity, they might not have time to do their job. If a student has a job such as babysitting, they have to be available when the parent needs a babysitter. If a student isn't available when the parent needs them, he may seem like an irresponsible child, and may never get another chance to babysit and make money. So as you can see, kids need enough time to do their job regardless of why they are making money.\n\nHaving all the time after school to complete homework, chores, and maybe even making a little money, is something every student would like. Not being required to do an extracurricular activity benefits students in many ways. No student would have to stress about not having enough time to do anything. Students would also have a lot more free time to do what they enjoy, such as hanging out with friends or watching movies. Also, parents wouldn't have to stress about their kid failing classes or not getting their chores complete. These are all reasons the principals decision to require students to do an extracurricular activity is the wrong decision. Therefore, I do not agree with the principals decision to require students to do extracurricular activities because students may have homework they need to complete, chores to do at home, or they may have a job such as babysitting or dog walking.",

    Essay: "I disagree with this decision because some people might not want to participate in these extracurricular activities. Some people rather go home and do other things because they might not enjoy any of these activities and they rather do other things. Also I think that these activities will get you exhausted because you also got other stuff to worry about outside of school. Then you got the most important thing witch is school work. So in this SA i'm going to be giving you reasons why I disagree with this decision.\n\nSchool work is a big deal, and a lot of people take it really serious so those people that take it really serious might think these activities will interfere with school work like studying all day or doing homework. Also some people got a certain schedule with school work like studying for a certain amount of time or doing homework for a certain amount of time, so I think these activities can interfere with peoples school schedule. Some people also hire tutors to help them after school so if those people with tutors had to do these activities they wouldnt be able to get the help they need and that can really affect them in school. Even for sports you got to practice to be good and if your to busy trying to practice you wont have that much time of school work.\n\nSo i think students should just focus on one thing which is school, and if your just focused on that one thing it would be better because you wouldnt have to worry about trying to practice and get school work done at the same time.\n\nThere are also people do are not into any of that kinda stuff, they rather just go home and do other stuff like play video games or go shopping. So if they had to do those activities they wouldnt have time to do what they want to do after school because of the activities. I also think that people should do what they want, like if they wanted to play video games after school or go shopping they should be able to do that instead of activities that they dont enjoy. Theres also no point of doing those activities either if you dont enjoy doing them, because then your just wasting your time when u could be doing stuff that u actually enjoy. Also people got stuff to do after school like chores, you wouldn't be able to do any of your chores because of the activities in the way. People also like hanging out with their friends after school and do stuff thats fun like play games outside or play video games together. Friends also like to hang out, and sometimes they cant hang out in school so they hang out when they get out of school. So I think these activities would interfere with peoples plans and friendships because if your doing these activities you really wouldnt have time to hang out with your friends.\n\nI also think it is kinda bad for your health because some people get exhausted and stressed out because they got a lot going on like sports, responsibilities like chores, and school and its kinda gonna be hard for you to get all of that stuff done in one day. But if you do get it done then your most likely gonna be really exhausted, and with that type of schedule it might make you go to bed really late and thats not good for your health because you still got got to wake up for school early in the morning. Sometimes you might even have a big test the next day and you might end up failing it because you didnt have a lot of time to study because of your schedule. You also got sports to worry about, you have to practice on your own and practice with your team so you can get better. Sometimes you might even have to travel far for your games and that takes up a lot of your time. Even tho its schools activities i think the best time to do any type of activities is summer time because then nobody has to worry about school work or sports.\n\nSo I think the principal should find another time to do the activities, maybe the weekends or the summer because I dont think students should be forced to do these activities because some of them might not like the idea and not just that but people still got a lot of other stuff they got to worry about so I dont think thats the right time to do the activities. So those are all my reasons why I disagree with the principle.",

    Essay: "Picture this you walk into school one day to an announcement from your principal saying that extracurricular activities will be made mandatory. Your'e appalled, but I'm here to convince you its not so terrible and may actually be beneficial for you and your community. Extracurriculars can keep kids out of trouble, get them into better colleges, help the community, and allow them to meet new people and try new things.\n\nGetting invested in an extracurricular activity is a great way to steer you away from a bad path. You may not have the time to do these things if all your time is being taken up by extracurriculars. It might also make you not want to do drugs or alcohol as they could affect your performance in one of these activities such as sports or a club that requires mental skills.\n\nExtracurricular activities can greatly improve the chances of you getting in the college you want. Getting into a good college can effect your job therefor the entire rest of your life, so starting some extracurriculars can be very important not just for college but onward into your career.. It has often been shown that students with lower grades but high numbers of extracurriculars have higher acceptance rates than their counterparts with higher grades but lower amounts of extracurriculars. Colleges also like to see students who help their school communities. A great way of helping your school's community is through extracurricular activities as they do of cost you anything and are easy to enroll into.\n\nMany extra curricular activities can help your school or local community. One example of a way to help your school's community is the yearbook committee as it helps out with creating the yearbook for that year in turn helping your school's community. The same could be said with your local community and an extracurricular that helps feed the homeless or donates to charities. Even though there are many ways to help your community extracurricular activities are a free way that requires little to no effort to become a member of one of them.\n\nExtracurricular activities can help you meet new people and try new things. You can meet people who have similar interests to you. Meeting new people can benefit students social skills. When constantly put into a scenario in which you are using a skill that you're bad at just like anything else practice makes perfect and that applies for socializing as well. For instance if you do a baseball club you will find people who probably play baseball making it much easier to find new friends. You may also want to do something that interests you but you have never tried it before. Who knows it may become your new favorite hobby or a future career path you could opt to take.\n\nWhile your principal may not actually be making extracurricular activities mandatory I would highly encourage everyone reading this to go out and take at least one. They could keep you out of trouble, get you into a good college, help your community, and help you meet new people. So go out and sign up for something and who knows maybe you'll love it.",

    Essay: "What would happen if your principal made a new rule where you have to go to an after school activity let me tell you what I think. On a personal scale I don't go to many after school activities. Once school is over I like to just get on the bus, go home and be done with school for the rest of the day. If the principle made a new rule where everybody had to do an after school activity I would strongly disagree. The reasons for this would be that some kids such as myself are tired of school and don't want to hang around. Another reason may be that they may have a sibling in a nearby elementary school that gets home later than them, but no parents are home so they have to be. The last reason is nothing may really stick out to some people.\n\nSomeday you just have had a long extra boring day and want to be done with it. If you do, I would agree that most after school activities are fun ways to waste time and keep you at school. I don't think that they should be enforced to go to them because people aren't always in the mood and just want to get home to relax, do there homework, and watch the Simpsons or play video games. Kids should'nt be force to do thing they don't like, even though that's exactly what school is. Kids need time to relax and do something on there own time and after school activities are not that.\n\nIf you have a younger sibling and both your parents work then you know what it's like. Having to go home right after school to make sure that they get there safe and then watching them till your parents get home. I feel that lots of kids have this problem or situation I should say. These are the type of people who don't have the time needed to g to any sort or type of after school activities. My question for the principal would be what would he do with these kids make them come and do them over the weekend have the parents hire a expensive babysitter. I'll tell you what he'll do absolutely nothing. He can't barge his way into a family plan like that just because he wants kids to stay at school longer. Thats a stupid reason, to change a families whole system over something so small like that. If I was ever a kid in a situation like this I still would not go, Because their family system family is more important than a principals wish to waste kids's time.\n\nThe last reason I disagree with this is what if a kid who has all the time in the world has an older sibling or a guardian of some sort at home for a younger sibling. They look over all of the choices and stare just stare at them all because theres nothing there that fits there personality, then what do they do? I'll tell you what they'll do they don't go to any of the after school activities because thee nothing that they like what's the point it'll just seem like school but longer. I know what people would say \"oh, but they may just find a hidden talent they never knew they had\". No, Ive gone to a variety of after school activities and not ne new thing I've tried I stuck with, shocker. What percentage of kids actually find a \"hidden talent\" probably like 26%. The point I'm trying to make here is that even if nothing sticks out you can still go and try to find that \" hidden talent\" but to me that's just a bunch of baloney.\n\nIn the long run an in many people an after school activity is a chance to spread your wings and grow, but to me they suck I hate them. If your principal ever makes a rule like this where you have to go to any after school activity then start a petition get fifth teen pages worth of signatures show it to him. Tell him why you did what you did show him whos the real boss is by over throwing him, destroying the school and getting rid of that stupid new rule. I just really hate after school activities and all they don't have to offer.",

    Essay: "I agree with the deision of the principal. I think that the students should do something that benefits them or the school. Things like playing a team sport can help in many ways. For example you get exposed to new people from your school you may have never talked to, and even kids from schools you dont even go to. And if the kid becomes very good at the sport they are playing then they can get recognized by colleges.\n\nIf the kid were to join the student council they get experience on being a leader for a group of people, they would have to make decisions for themselves and others, and get the experience they need to help them succeed in the real world. These are all important skils that I think each person sould have some experience with.\n\nIf the kid wanted to work on the yearbook they would learn about photography. This gives the kid a chance to go around the school and talk to some of the teachers, and students. They get to take pictures and dont have to sit in their classrooms for as long as their classmates. They get to see their friends, and learn about the art of photgraphy which can open doors for jobs in the future.\n\nI think these activities arent just to make it so the student has something to do with tht hour or hour and a half of their day. I think these activities are extra chances given to us to help prepar for the future. And give us the skills needed to succeed, like working with others, and being a leader. These skills may not be offered agian in the future so I would suggest taking advantage of what you have been given. But these activities arent just done to help make your future a little brighter. Than done to help make the youth of the person playing these sports, oo on the council more enjoyable for them. To help them have fun and spend time with the people they enjoy. This can create memorys that peoplle want to keep because of the way they make a person feel. So choose wisely when picking the activities, make sure its oone that you know you will enjoy.",

    Essay: "Students being required to join clubs at school is unfair and shouldn't be aloud. I think that having clubs for students to join and have the opportunity too is great and not at lot of kids around the world have that opportunity. But having students, especially teenagers required to join clubs could even make them resent school. It takes time out of every ones day, the students, teachers, and parents. Students being required to take clubs affects everyone.\n\nParents of these children will have to move around their work schedule to make the time to drive their kids to and from their clubs, and that isn't really fair. And what if the clubs cost money and students can't participate, what would happen then? Schools alone already have clubs to join but maybe some of the clubs don't appeal to students but they're forced to join one anyway, again thats not fair. Students also have a life outside of school, they may already do a sport, homework, work, or chores they need to do at home. Students have a life outside of school and shouldn't be forced to spare their own time.\n\nThere are a few reasons why it can be good though too. Schools could make money from the clubs and have more opportunities to help with their school. Some of the club's schools could help students in the future, then if students see themselves playing a sport in the future they can get a head start with the club. This could be a general idea for most clubs open to students. Joining a club could also help students be more social and meet people who have the same interests in them. If the school decides too, they could open clubs that could help them in the future for example, they could open a club that teaches students how to pay bills or taxes.\n\nI think if students wanted to join a club they should, just as long as they want to and their not forced or required to. From my perspective as a student, if we were required to join a club it should be during school time not our own. Students have other things they also need to do in their life besides school. I think clubs are a great idea and do help you make friends and meet new people. If you choose the right club it could be an amazing thing for you. Clubs can be helpful for students sometimes, but again forcing them isn't the way to go.\n\nBeing required to take a club has its ups and downs. Having students participate in clubs could cause money and social problems. But it could give students opportunities and help them in the future. This should be a students choice, not the schools. If the school wants to make students take clubs on their own time, they need to check with parents too first. In conclusion, I think clubs are a great idea for students just as long as its their choice and they get to choose the club they want to be in.",

    Essay: "Life is all about exploring your strengths and weaknesses. Since the principal has decided for everyone to participate in an extracurricular activity, I have thought about the positives and negatives about this decision. I agree with the principal that students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it can help students be more confident in themselves, it can teach students a good work ethic, and it can show students how to better manage the personal time.\n\nTo begin with, students should be in an extracurricular activity so they can learn to be more confident in themselves. Some students, new or that have been at the school, can have a hard time searching for someone who they can relate with. Also, many student are shy and have a hard time going up to someone and have a conversation with them. With participating in an after school program, they can have a easier time socializing with someone. This can build their confidence to talk to people outside of the activity and make new in different ways. To bring my thoughts together, students can build new relationship and build up more confidence in themselves to do more.\n\nMy next point is, being in an after school program is helpful to teach students to have a good work ethic. A lot students have trouble being and staying on task. With joining an extracurricular activity they can learn ways and strategies to better handle their school work. Being in a program can also help them because it is hopefully something they enjoy participating in, so they will be more motivated to work harder and find way to get better. To sum it up, students will work more diligently and want to be better to create a better work ethic for themselves by doing something they love.\n\nFinally, being in an extracurricular activity is helpful to students because it shows them how to better manage they own personal time. Every student, including me, has had times where they had a hard time trying to fit everything in at once. This can be a struggle throughout someones whole life. This is why students should have an after school activity to do, so they can learn how to manage their time from an early age. Being able to use your time is something that can takes you through life. To learn that skill from middle school can help you through high school and beyond. To conclude, student will know how to take care of their time and use it more efficiently from being apart of an extracurricular activity.\n\nTo make the big picture, students should be apart of an extracurricular activity because it can teach students how to manage their time, make students have a better work ethic, and help students to build up their confidence. Being in an after school activity should not be mandatory in the first place. It has countless benefits to it, so being in one should be one of the first things that comes to mind early in your life.",

    Essay: "\n\nyour principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree or disagree with this decision .\" I agree with this decision in the following areas of extra size, helping the school or teachers, and getting extra help. However, their in these activities so students can learn and have fun.\n\nThe first reason why all the students should participate in school activities is extra size from playing sports. However, when students play sports their running, throwing, hitting, and kicking. For example, playing baseball, football, soccer, these are ways of getting extra size,it is good for you. Therefore, its not only about extra size its about having fun and hanging with friends during the activities. Sport games get intense when playing with friends, students and others go hard core.\n\nAnother reason why students should participate in the activities is so they can Help the school or teachers means grade papers, plant flowers, help janitors, tutor others, and work on year book. Those are things that are helpful, The principal would love for the students to participate in a helping activity so all the staff or teachers don't have to do it by them self the students can help. Therefore, students should join helping activities so their grades can get in on time because their helping teachers grade papers and also the students would have a clean school.\n\nThe third and final, students should participate in after school extracurricular activities because they can get extra help on class work that the students struggle with. However, say a student doses not get whats going on in a class they can ask a teacher for after school pass and stay after. Therefore, this is a very helpful way to help students with their classes or assignments. For example, when i need help i ask the teacher for a lunch pass or after school pass and then she has more time to explain vs in a regular time period class she has to help others too with their work.\n\nTo come to the conclusion the principal has made the right choice to make all students come to different types of activities,sport activities, helping staff or teachers, extra help, there in these activities so students can learn and have fun. I agree with this decision in the following areas of extra size, helping the school or teachers, and getting extra help.",

    Essay: "Have your parents ever forced you to do a sport? You usually end up not having fun. If you're doing activities against your will, why would you want to bring that to school? Extra curricular activities shouldn't be enforced because it interferes with the parents' schedule, it takes away the students' factor of choice, and it prevents teachers from going home at their typical time.\n\nTo start off, enforcing after school activities isn't a great idea because it can interfere with parents' schedules. For example, parents might not be able to pick up their kids late, possibly due to the fact that they need someone to help out with their younger children. If kids are held after school, the parents will need to rearrange their schedule in order to be there for their kids. In addition, this policy could prevent the parents from being able to pick their kids up. depending on how late the extracurricular activities run, parents could be busy with other things, such as grocery shopping, by the time their kid gets out of school. Also, some parents depend on public transportation. If there isn't a conveniently scheduled bus, the child won't have a way to get home. These scenarios demonstrate how enforcing clubs, sports, or groups can intervene with parents' schedules.\n\nSecondly, having extracurricular activities after school as a priority isn't a good idea because it takes away the student's factor of choice. Adding on, children won't be as independent as they would have been, which will effect them later in life. If they don't build their individuality now, then they could possibly have trouble with it in years to come. In addition, students could feel controlled. If these policies are made, kids could feel like they don't have a say in what goes on in their space of education. Also, children will have to schedule their outside life around after school. They might be put in a position where they have to let go of activities they're passionate in, simply to not get in trouble at school. These three examples show why extracurricular policies will take away a child's choice.\n\nLastly, making extracurricular activities a necessity isn't an great decision because it forces teachers to stay later. To start, teachers have a life after school, and staying later than normal could interfere on that. Also, educators might have to complete chores, such as buying groceries, before a certain time each day. Having them stay late could throw off their whole routine. Lastly, many teachers have kids of their own. Depending on their age(s), they will get dismissed from school at different times. This is why necasary extracurricular activities will affect a teacher's schedule.\n\nAs shown in these paragraphs, enforcing extracurricular activities can affect the parents' everyday plan, prevent kids from making their own choices, and interfere with teachers' after school life. Holding back students affects more than just the kids. It affects everyone involved, and more. With these explanations, hopefully you won't be forced to play a sport or join a group again.",

    Essay: "The principal has proposed the idea that all students should participate in 1 or more extra-curricular activity. Participating in 1 or more extra curricular helps students manage time, try new things, and pursue future careers. This would help students as they get older and help build good habits.\n\nExtra-curricular activities help students manage time. On top of homework, the students now have other things to focus and concentrate on. Students now have practice, private lessons, training, or research to do because of their new activity. This will help students to use their time more wisely and to have priorities. Time management is a good useful skill that many adults struggle with, so learning it in school would be a huge benefit to the student.\n\nThe new plan will also help inspire students to try new things. There are many kinds of extra-curricular and students would try things they have never done before. The students might find a new hobby or something they want to pursue professionally. The plan will force students out of their comfort zone and will help students to try different things. For these reasons, students joining activities will try new things and can be used as a skill in the future.\n\nExtra-curricular activities help students pursue dreams and possible careers. Students have hobbies and decide if they like it to the point that they want to pursue it further. Extra-curricular are the way that they can pursue their hobbies. Extra-curricular are easy ways for students to use skills, whether its sports, science, math, engineering, or art. As they use these skills, they hone their talent so that they can use it in the future. Students can try anything and the new plan was a nudge for students to do just that.\n\nThe new extra-curricular program will help students manage time, try new things, and pursue dreams and goals. The new program will help create new habits as well as letting students explore what they enjoy. This new plan focuses on students using their time wisely and productively and that is why the principals decision is the right one.",

    Essay: "I agree with kids having to do one extracurricular activity,because it gets a lot more students involved in the community. It can also lead to kids living a healthy lifestyle. There could be a potential basketball player that does not know what he is capable of and he could find it through sports. When they work in the yearbook they can find someone who is new to the school and make them feel welcomed. They can find things they never knew that they liked. This can lead to a better school and community.\n\nWhen a student is forced to do something first they don't like it but then it can lead to many different things in the future. For example, you don't know if you like something until you try it. It is the same way with sports. What if there is a kid that plays basketball for fun but he does not want to try out. Now he can try out and if he really likes it he can furthermore better his skills at it. What if because he had to do the bare minimum of one activity he gets many scholarships in high school and goes to the NBA. Just because of that one activity.\n\nStudents have a tuff time fitting in sometimes and it can help by doing extracurricular activities. For example, both students both like taking pictures but they don't think anything of it. They both join the yearbook program which takes pictures of students and faculty.

    Essay: "Success is not shown for just doing one thing, it's shown for doing multiple things.\" -Taylor Swift once said. To further more illustrate, Students love playing sports or playing with the chess club at school. Students get to have fun out of school while still being on school grounds. For this reason, Students should be able to complete one extracurricular activity because it can lead to a new friendship, students have lots of fun, and it keeps you active.\n\nTo begin with, Completing one activity could lead to new friendship. For example, My friend had just made the soccer team and had no clue who any of his teammates were. There was another student who had made the team who wasn't familiar with his teammates, so my friend and him became best friends. Another example is, When doing the yearbook the two girls fought to see who could get the best pictures so they can be announced best photographer, when one of the girl's trampled over a crowd of football players and broke her camera. The other girl stopped what she was doing to come help her, yet knowing she was always mean to her and showed no respect. Because of this, Friendship can occur when you least expect it in tough times. There is always someone out there that just wants to be your friend. New friends lead to more fun.\n\nSecondly, Students have most fun when they can be themselves. To illustrate, When playing your favorite sport, or doing your after school activity. You get to run, play, talk, and be free. All things you only can do every once in a while in school. Most of all you can be your self. To further show, Signing up to do Chess club, Art club, and Robotics are all fun and interesting things to do after school. One robotics team got to go kings dominion because there tournament was so close. As a result, Having fun is the most precious things you can have while being a student. You can be free with knowing theres no limits to having fun and being active.\n\nFinally, Being active while being a student is healthy. To show, Scientist have found that 3/4 of the student population is not being active. Students have not been productive after school hours, so the school boards have gotten together, and decided to have after school activities to keep students healthy and productive after school. Additionally, Students can choose there activity to complete or try out for a sport. This way it's better to keep the students more engaged with the school, yet keep them active. Therefor, keeping students in a chair for six hours is not always gonna keep the students energetic for the whole entire day.\n\nIn conclusion,\"Don't expect someones success to come to you, follow your own path to success\" -Nike. To further explain, Students can take what class they like. Most students take classes there friends take, but never understood why they took that class when there not good at it. Same as an extracurricular activity. Students can take what ever activity they want for their reasons. Students should agree with having to take one extracurricular class because, it leads to new friendships, students have lots of fun, and it keeps them active. Instead of students being bored all day. They can take one activity of their choosing, while having fun, and being social with other kids.",

Well I for one agree with the principal's decision (that every student should take at least one extracurricular activity).This is because of my satisfactory experience with soccer for the school varsity team; soccer as an extracurricular activity for me has been beneficial in ways such as providing me and teaching me principles/essential fundamentals that are used in real life scenarios (such as collaboration, and team-work),it is a productive break from school, and soccer has kept me in good shape and, physically in a healthy condition because of practice, and other things required to play the sport. So because I took soccer and it has helped me with those aspects in characteristic traits,being a productive break, and keeping me healthy, everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity and abide by the principals decision.\n\nOne reason to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer and support my position is because it guides students into learning traits like collaboration,team work, and communication (components used in soccer), and they carry out to a students daily life. For example before I took soccer as an extracurricular activity I didn't know how to work with people and that lead to me doing bad in group assignments; we had one for science where we worked on a environmental poster I did not know when to share Idea's,take leadership, or surprisingly how to ask for help! However, when I took soccer we worked on those fundamentals (in training you learn how to pass, how to ask for the ball, and how to get support from your teammates,etc). Those ideals carried on to my personal life and I noticed I started having better coordination with my peers in the science project (also just groups in general). Therefore all students should take at least one extracurricular activity so they learn the vital skills such as the ones I learned in soccer which improves coordination,communication,collaboration, and many more; these skills carry onto daily life for a student and make real life scenarios easier to deal with.\n\nAnother way soccer has benefited me and proves every student should take an extracurricular activity is because they act as productive breaks from school. Studies have shown students spend about 2 hours on their phone daily, we can all infer these 2 hours were spent on their free time because phones aren't allowed to be used in school. This fact is accurate for me because before I took soccer, I spent most of my time for recreation on my phone; it acted as a very unproductive break and didn't benefit me in any way (all I did was scroll through social media), but that all changed when I emerged my self into soccer. Those hours I spent on my phone were all replaced with productive training and it was more enjoyable than scrolling through Instagram; I also found my self less guilty and soccer provided me benefits way more superior then just staying at home and doing nothing with my time of leisure (such as the benefits listed in this essay, healthiness,a guide of skills,etc). Ultimately, students should be required to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer because of how they act as productive breaks from the useless addictions of teens such as phones,video games, and many more, and they provide more benefits then those leisurely activities.\n\nFinally, the last reason to support the principals decision is because extracurricular activities like soccer or regarding sports, and activities that get adolescents moving, make them physically more healthy and make exercise fun for students. My personal problem used to be weight ;before I took soccer I was 5'10 and 160 pounds I found exercise UN-enjoyable, and was on my way to face the huge problem of\n\n\"American Obesity\". Since I loved the sport so much I naturally lost 30 lb; since soccer requires a lot of cardiovascular training such as running. I also found my self doing other exercises to help my self get better at the sport such as swimming,yoga, and much more! It is a known fact that people who are more fit tend to look after them selves, and move around much more than the \"average Joe.\" Therefore, extracurricular activities such as soccer are important and one should be taken by at least every student because they provide a healthy amount of exercise (that is enjoyable), in a students daily life, and can solve problem such as being over-weight.\n\nIn conclusion I support the principals decision to require extracurricular activities for every student. Because of my experience with taking soccer has provided me traits relevant to real life scenarios such as team work,collaboration and many more other traits important for real life, It acted as a productive recreational activity while substituting for my phone usage, and at last it has made me a healthier student, and stopped me to my path to obesity. So whether its soccer,football,media communications for the school,or any other activity I cannot stress enough the importance of extracurricular activities, and I definitely agree with the principals decision for the requirement. The fact extracurricular activities are proven to boost student performance in subjects is more than enough of a reason to partake on an activity, don't you think?",

    Essay: "Dear Reader\n\nI would say yes to having an extracurricular activity in school cause it could be healthy, could get you to quit being lazy, and might teach you a valuable lesson for the future. The reason why I may think this could be a benefit to your life is because it helped me alot. You should try it at some point and see how you like it.\n\nPeople ask all the time how is this healthy. I think this is healthy because in some of the activities you are getting exercise. Exercise is helping people lose weight everyday. If you think about it can also help your body for lots of things. Dont put your body in to much pain though.\n\nIt might help people with their lazyness although they still might reject sports. It could get them up out of bed to talk with some new really good freinds. It might honestly do a lot of things like they actually have fun. It would definietly get some kids off the video games. Like my Brother for example. What do you think about how this can also get kids off other things?\n\nI know some of these things has definitly tought me some valuable lessons for the future. I mean you could change this world.\n\nWith these lessons in your head, it could change your family if you share, or teach the lessons to them. Have you ever learned a valuable lesson in life from a extracurricular activities?\n\nThese are my reasons for why I would have kids in school have the extracurricular activities for their health, lazyness, and last but not least, the lessons they could learn.",

    Essay: "Sure extracurricular activities are fun for some students, but if you try to make a kid who is already stressed out with school work and add more to their load it could make some students break down! When and if your principal or teacher brings up the situation they are probably only thinking about the benefits, and not the down sides. Some students would be just fine with this because they are already in one of those activities or sports, but for someone who are not, it will probably cause them to worry, (which we don't need that). Therefore I disagree that all students should be required at least one extracurricular activity because most teachers give homework, there would be no time to take care of pets or do chores, and it would just create more stress to add to student's everyday lives.\n\nFirst of all, most teachers give homework to their students every night. If students also have activities in the afternoon there are so many bad things that could come from that. One thing that could happen is students rush through their work and don't do it the way it should be done. It would be just like telling a bunch of high school students,\" here you have twenty minutes to right a two page essay\". Another reason could be if students have a lot of homework and stay up late at night to get it done they will come to school the next day tired, or even be late for school in general. The last way this can affect kids is if they do not get their homework done they can start to fail their classes. For these reasons I feel it would be unfair to require students to have these activities!\n\nSecondly, I know that there is a huge amount of people and kids that have chores when they get home from work or, in this case, school. If kids have to go to their extra activities they will either end up not doing their chores or rushing through them and not getting them done well. Also research has shown that there are more families in the United States today that have pets than there are that don't. If kids have these extracurricular activities then when are they going to find the time to take care of their pets. These are just a few more reasons why I disagree with this decision.\n\nLastly, I know I mentioned it before but I will say it again, if students are required to do even just one extra activity it will just add more unneeded stress to their plate! Students already have enough stress in their lives that have to do with their lives at home, their grades, and drama at school. Also, if this were to really happen there would be a lot of kids that would feel insecure, or feel like they aren't good enough to do certain activities! I know that if this happened at my school I would be one of those students. There you have it, just one more great reason why we should not let this happen.\n\nIn conclusion, students should not be required to do an extracurricular activity because, students have homework, they have chores and pets to take care of, and they don't need the extra stress that will come with these activities. Kids should have the freedom to do as they please, (most of the time, anyway), and they should not have to do anything they don't want to do! If this is happening where you live and you don't agree, feel free to use some of this info to persuade your principal or teacher to not let activities continue to be a requirement!",

    Essay: "Many students engage in school activities. The athletes play sports after school, the drama kids join plays, and book clubs meet up after school to discuss their book. I think that students should participate in an extracurricular activity. Students participating in an extracurricular activity is a phenomenal idea because it is a good way for the student to take a break from school work, the student is doing something they enjoy, and their activity could help the student later on in life.\n\nFirstly, an extracurricular activity is a good way for the student to take a break from school work. School work can be very stressful and time consuming to a student. The student is receiving school work every day throughout the year, and most of the time their teacher gives them homework right after they are done with their school work. The student could use their extracurricular activity as a way to take a break from their school work. I, being a student myself, do not enjoy school work, so I joined a book club and go to meetings every Saturday.\n\nSecondly, the student can do something that they enjoy for an extracurricular activity. A lot of students in this generation get very bored easily, especially if what they are doing is something that they do not enjoy. Many students that I know think that school work is very boring and they hate doing their homework. If the student joins or engages in an extracurricular activity at school, they can do something that they enjoy doing. While they are doing the activity, they can meet other people that enjoys it too. For example, I enjoy singing and acting and I have been doing those things since I was four years old. Now that I am older and I enjoy it even more, I joined an advanced singing group, I take a drama class, and I got into the school play.\n\nLastly, the students extracurricular activity could help them with many things later on in their life. Many athletes play sports because they like sports, but some sports can get the athlete a scholarship to college, if the student wants to attend college, and can probably give them many opportunities while they are in college. Their activity can be on their record and look very good to colleges and the student would have a better chance of getting into the college that they want to go to.\n\nThe students activity could also help with certain skills that they would need for the students occupation. For example, when I grow up I want to be a singer. Being in an advanced singing group helps me learn how to do certain techniques that a singer would have to know.\n\nIn conclusion, taking a break from school, the student doing something they enjoy, and a good help for the students future are reasons why I think students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are phenomenal for students and very helpful for students as well.",

    Essay: "Although some might argue that extracurricular activities are useless or have no purpose, they can prove to be quite the opposite. I agree that all students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches time management skills and encourages students to pursue hobbies.\n\nTime management skills are vital to succeed in school and work environments, especially later on in life. Balancing time between school and hobbies is a great way to teach these skills early on. Once students reach a higher level of school, like college, they need to know how to balance time between hobbies, going out with friends, having fun, studying, and getting their homework done. If they can't manage time, they might devote too much time towards homework and studying and lose motivation from overworking without breaks. A loss of motivation could then lead to dropping out of college. On the other hand, if they put too much time towards having fun, their grades could plummet from not completing homework, and they would then risk being removed from their college due to a low GPA. In either case, the final result would be the student losing their chance at earning a college degree. Additionally, students who don't participate in extracurricular activities will be used to having all of their time to do work, and won't have learned proper time management skills. Without these skills, it's nearly impossible to move forward in life. Cultivating these skills before reaching college and high school could be the difference between earning or losing a college degree.\n\nSecondly, if students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would encourage them to pursue hobbies and talents. Without a rule requiring students participate in activities, they might have had no reason to try new things in the past. With a rule, however, students would have a reason to try the hobby they had always thought about but never put into action. If they don't like what they try, it's easy to move on and choose something new. For students who already have a hobby, this would simply give them a reason to continue to practice and improve in it. Students might find that they have a talent for something, or it could even become a lifelong passion. Cultivating talents at a younger age allows more time to practice and improve them before you need to use them. If your hobby is soccer, for example, then starting young would give you years to develop soccer skills, practice, and play games before you are being reviewed for a college soccer scholarship. Whether it's trying something new or continuing to improve in something, having a hobby can expose talent or develop skills that you can use later in life.\n\nOverall, students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to manage their time and encourages them to pursue hobbies. Time management skills are extremely important, and developing these skills at a younger age would benefit students greatly. It's important to try new things as well, because you might find that you love what you tried or have a talent for it. If you never try new things, then you'll never know if you would have liked them or not. Your hobbies and time management skills are two things that will follow you through life, and there's no better time to learn and practice them than now.",

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities are great ways to learn and develop skills. When you take one, you might think \"Hey, these are so great! Everyone should take one!\" But that really isn't the case for everyone. Most people have differing time schedules from one another, Some people have to cook dinner for their families or do a wide variety of chores once they get home, or they have plans with their family and friends. to make them take a extracurricular activity may push their chores and/ or responsibilities further into the night. Speaking about responsibilities, what about homework?\n\nHomework, middleschoolers and highschoolers are smothered with it every day, every week, every year. Homework, depending on your academic intelligence, may take a while, it may make them stay up late on a school day. Students usually stay up late at night doing homework, and making them do a extracurricular activity during the school year may make them stay up later due to not having that time after they leave school to do their homework, they may end up being more fatigued, they may not turn in their homework, and they may not be able to do their share of the project making people look badly upon them and making their grades suffer, When you have to stay up late at night, you usually are more tired, less aware, and your grades may drop.\n\nWhen you are smothered with homework, you usually stay up at night, sluggishly going through the homework so you can finally go to sleep, in FCPS, at the beginning of the year, the teachers reported that homework usually takes 2 to 4 hours. The students go home at 2:22, but they usually get home by 2:50, or 3 during unlucky circumstances. What if we added about 2 hours to that? they get home by 4 in the afternoon, they now have to do their homework. That may take them about 3 and a half hours and by now, its 7:30, the plans they had, down the drain, now they have eat dinner and go to bed because they have to wake up at 5 or 6 in the morning to catch a bus that comes at 6:30. Their weekdays just practically consist of school and homework. they will get not free time until the weekend, and that isn't guaranteed because some teachers will assign homework during the weekends! According to a study, when students have no free time and their time just consists of homework, that will lead up to more stress, and stress leads up to anxiety, and anxiety leads up to depression.\n\nIf anything, we should make extracurricular activities optional because of these questions, \"Do they have the time?\"\n\n\"Will they be able to keep up?\" \"Will they be able to do this without getting too stressed out?\" \"Do they have too much homework?\". Extracurricular activities should be optional because students should choose what they want to do or they don't want to do, they are freethinking.",

    Essay: "Hello i'm Generic_Name and i'm here to talk about an idea i've heard that just sounds crazy. Do you ever want to go home after a long day at school and want to relax, eat, or even nap? Well with this idea of requiring all students to do an after school activity completely kills the relaxing dream. I believe these three reasons should give you an idea on why we should not be required to do an extracurricular activity. First after a long day at school we are tired, students also might be independent or antisocial, finally some kids are not healthy enough to be doing after school activities. These are all things the principal should take to account before implementing this idea.\n\nFirst reason I believe we should be allowed to choose if we do an activity after school is that we the students are very tired in the regard that we wake up extremely early and must get ready to go to school. Another example of being tired is after waking up for school we proceed to work for 7hrs and learn. The final piece of evidence is that we through out the school day we do not get time to relax and take a breather to process all this information we took in for the day. so after all this going through our day we definitely need a break to relax. I dont know about you but I definitely need a nap after such a day. These are just some examples on why students would be tired and not want to do extracurricular activities.\n\nThe second reason we should be offered a choice to do after school activities is that lots of teens in this day and age are independent or antisocial. Some kids would prefer to work alone and just be by themselves. I know when I work alone I plug my headphones in and crank the volume to my music and jam along while I work or play. Another preference for students is that being in the comfort of your home and knowing your alone and can say whatever you want makes them feel comfortable and helps them focus on working. The final reason that some kids prefer to be independent is that you dont have to worry someone else is smarter or better than you. you can just know that you are the only person you have to worry about and being alone helps with that. In my personal life I know some people judge and that would slow me down and i would focus on there comment. So being independent is another reason I would dislike the after school idea.\n\nThe third and final reason I disagree with this decision is that, some teens are in health matters and are not healthy enough to do things after school. If a child has a mental barrier or a setback that can stop them from performing like other students. I know about some kids that have speech impediments so if they were to play on a sports team it would be extremely challenging because communication is important. A lot of teens in America are also overweight and are not cut out for playing sports or being on a team. Finally some kids are injured and are healing with a cast or a neck brace, witch stops them from participating in sports or writing if they cannot use there dominant hand. I had an infection in my finger not long ago and I take piano so when i tried to play I was stopped by the injury and it was holding me down.\n\nSo in conclusion to all these reasons, being tired after a long day at school, having health issues or injures, and having a preference of being alone, I still believe that we should be offered the choice and power to choose if we would like to participate in an extracurricular activity. Just think about how nice it would be to get to relax after the long stressful day at at school. Besides teachers or adults dont want to have to deal with kids after they did for a whole day right? So I hope that this idea is just an idea and we should think about the challenges kids face and keep things the way they are. I love being able to go home crack open a water bottle have a apple and watch YouTube. Wouldnt teachers like the same to just skip the after school stress?",

    Essay: "POV (Point Of View): Talking to a group of students in hopes of convincing them to join extracurricular activities and giving them a little bit of insight on the benefits of them.\n\nIt's a common and widely spread opinion to think that school is dreadful. Some students wake up with no other goal than trying to get through their day as quickly as possible. It is true that the concept of school itself can be very over-whelming, especially when everyday feels like a repeat of yesterday. I believe that there are a few ways to make students look forward to going to school, and that is extracurricular activities. Even if you don't want to participate simply because you don't want to involve yourself at all in anything school related, it's still important that you do a minimum of one extracurricular activities. If you think about it, all students, like yourselves, are required to attend school everyday regardless, so why not try making your own personal stay a little more enjoyable?\n\nThere's a variety of activities to choose from. If some students are not the sporty type, there are plenty of non physically-active activities still available. These activities are usually non-school related unless you choose it to be. Not only are you given the opportunity to choose what activity you think suits you best, but these activities give you time to yourself everyday to distract your brain from obtaining knowledge constantly and instead putting your mind at ease for a while whilst still being somewhat productive. Some of these activities may already be ones that you do normally as hobbies such as drawing, acting, playing an instrument and/or sport.\n\nDepending on what activity you choose, you may get the chance to improve your skills in things you may be struggling in such as Math, writing, English, etc. If you're lucky, you may find an activity that will inspire and guide any passions you have. The great thing about being able to choose what you want to sign up for as an extracurricular activity is that chances are, you'll most likely be able to find something you're interested in or perhaps find out about talents/skills you weren't aware you ever had! Some of the singers and/or actresses/actors that you see today are only here because their talents were discovered as little children in places such as schools. Maybe participating in one activity will help you unlock a new passion for something as well.\n\nMany schools offer clubs or activities that some may find boring or useless but still significant for your knowledge. Clubs such as Self Defense Club is one that will teach you the manners and logistics on how to defend and protect yourself in certain situations. There have even been times where knowing these life-saving tips have spared someones life. You never know what people are capable of, especially being surrounded with many people you don't know personally in school. One of the most important benefits of signing up for an activity is friendship. If you sign up, everyone else will want to too and that increases the probability of you meeting someone who's interested in the same hobbies as you. Numerous activities available for sign-up in schools are beneficial and fun and could help you shape your future, so thinking twice would be a wise decision!\n\nIt's safe to say that extracurricular activities aren't hurting anyone. If anything, they bring people together and help you familiarize yourself with what catches your eye and what doesn't. If you're someone that's scared to exit your comfort zone just remember; Comfort zones are your quota, they are a comfortable and familiar place, but nothing ever grows there.",

    Essay: "Do you ever come home from school and go straight to the TV or your phone? I can say that sometimes I do. I know that sometimes we come home from a hard day at school and all that you want to do is get your mind off of it and play video games or watch TV. What if there was another option? Allowing students to have a extracurricular activities outside of school may just help. It could help you get your mind of whatever happened at school that day. I believe that students should be able to participate in a extra activity after school, because then it gives them something to do instead of being on their phone, it gets them interacting with others, and they could potentially find a new hobby.\n\nStudents should participate in an extra activity after school, because it will give them something to do instead of being on their phone. Getting kids off of their phones and convincing them to do something else can be hard. Getting off of our phones is a good thing, because we can be more active in many ways. Students and teens are on our phones way too much in their free time. Us students have way too much free time at home. Most of us use our valuable free time on a device. Being on a device is not helping our health and our social activity in any way, shape or form. Getting us students to get off of our devices would benefit us in many ways. When we are at home, teens tend to audomadicly go on a device. We don't realize how much we are on our screens and not focused on anything else. Having these after school activities, it will hopefully get kids off of their screens and focus on whats going on around them. From my own thoughts, I believe that students should have after school activities because then we will be able to focus on what is happening around them and not on their screens, because whatever is on our screens, we can always go back and look at it later.\n\nTeens should have an after school activity, because it gets you interacting with others. Students who take the time to be around and get to know others, probably have a higher relationship status than the ones who don't participate in other activities outside of school. Some kids and teens have a hard time interacting and making friends with others. Having these after school activities, it will get them interacting with others and making new friends. Even if students have friends, they can invite them to whatever club that they are doing and maybe they will join with you and make new friends too. If you know someone who doesnt have many friends, but you think that they will enjoy something new like this, you should invite them and show them around. Don't be afraid to talk to new people and try new things. Everyone should be included and have lots of fun.\n\nFrom my examples, I can strongly believe that there should be after school activities, for everyone and not just some students.\n\nSometimes, trying something new might be better for you an you may even find a new hobby. Trying new things is always good. You may even enjoy it a lot. I know that when I started playing volleyball I wasnt to sure about it. In fact, my friend made me do it. We went to the volleyball lesson and when we got there, I was a little intimidated. I never thought that coming back from that lesson , that I would still be playing. After the lesson was over, I ran to my mom and gave her a big hug. I told my mom that I wanted to keep coming to these clinics and to come with my friend Hailey again. My mom was in big shock because we all new that I wasnt big on trying new things. The point is, I wouldnt be where I am today if I didnt try something outside of my comfort zone. By trying something new, I found my new favorite hobby and I play it almost everyday now. The point that I was trying to get across of that would be that trying new things could lead to something that you love and want to do again. What is the worst that can happen when you try something new? Not much. You have to go into something thinking that everything happens for a reason and that everything will turn our great and that you will have fun. From my own experiences, I can say that everything happens for a reason and never hesitate to try something new.\n\nI believe that students should have an after school extracurricular activity, because of the reasons being, it gives you something to do in your extra free time, you will interact with others and make new friends, and you will find a new hobby that you may really enjoy. Dont be afraid to try new things, and to do them with new people. Always remember that if you don't like something, that you dont have to keep on doing it. But that does not mean to not try something new, and to enjoy it in the moment.",

Then these students would just bottle up their thoughts and emotions about the extra activities, and some of the quiet kids may become sad because they think that no one wants to even consider their ideas for something different. No principal would want their students to feel sad,right. I just think that those students should be allowed to speak to a teacher or someone else in charge and not in public in front of a bunch of people, because then they wont say anything but it should be done some where private.\n\nFurthermore us as students don't like it when new rules just randomly appear to our knowledge. Just ask us if we would like to do things like extra activities, don't just come up to us and say \"these are the new rules now follow them\".

    Essay: "Do you really believe that all kids should do an extracurricular activity after school? Well, I do and so does the principal at my school. Also, an extracurricular activity dosen't always have to be a sport. It can be working on the yearbook, joining different clubs, or it could be a sport. I agree with this decision because it gets children more active, helps them communicate with other students, and just to do something instead of being at home.\n\nFirstly, the decision makes children more active by doing things to keep them moving. There are different activities in the sports catergory to keep children moving and active. The activites consist of cheer,soccer, baseball, softball. tennis, etc. There are also inside activites such as volleyball, swim team, and basketball. Those were some examples of activites you could do to get kids active.\n\nFurthermore, this decision helps children communiate with other students. Normally, children are shy when they meet other kids, but joining different activites throughout the years wouldnt be so hard to talk to other students. Kids often don't talk when joining new activites beacuse of the lack of communication or the lack of knowing the other students. I know this from experience. Joining extracurricular activites will help with communication around the school.\n\nLastly, students should just want to do something instead of being at home. I wouldn't like to be at home all day knowing I could be at home all day knowing I could be doing something fun at school. Most kids like to stay home and be bored, but little do they know, they could be in different types of activites after school. I also do activites after school, because i don't wan't to be at home doing nothing. Students doesn't like to stay at home anyway.\n\nThe decision of making all kids do activites is agreeable. They should be more active, communicate with more students, and should want to do something instead of being home. I believe that if all students at my school do extracurricular activites that the school would be a little but more fun. The students at the school would be more into ging to school.",

We should not be forced to have an extracurricular activity because it prevents choice, gives more stress, and it has the potential to make students stop trying to learn and quitting.\n\nWhen it comes to me, I think everyone should have freedom of choice or opinion. No one should be limited to either of them. Forcing students to have an extracurricular activity is directly violating the freedom of choice that I always believe in. Let's say for instance a student does not want to take a sport or a activity because he/she always goes to a friends house after school for homework or that they just don't want to do it. Well now, he/she is denied of that choice because he/she is forced to take a sport or a job in the school. Just from forcing to play a sport or having to something for the school, all kinds of situations could erupt that aren't good at all. The right to have a choice is very important and we shouldn't be denied of that. That's why we should not be forced to have an extracurricular activity.\n\nYou might not think it but no one wants to have stress. Not even people that say they want to have stress. Some students have a very tight schedule and can't add anything else to it. Their day is filled to the brim with things to do and it is stressful enough already. Giving that, imagine how stressful they would get when the principal said that they had to do an extracurricular activity and they had no choice. It would be like a death sentence to them. I got a lot of stress too back then, and it was not pretty. Worrying and being desperate are not things I would want other students or me to experience. Having to have an activity to do for school is a breeze for some students; to others though, it could be quite the opposite. Forcing students to have an extracurricular activity has a negative effect instead of a positive one on students.\n\nQuitting is not an option\n\n-unknown.\n\nWell, it could be now for Generic_School. Students are like houses. Let's say each wall for the student is like a thing in their life.\n\nAmount of fun, learning, homework, stress, etc. You have to put an equal amount of material and size into it. You can't add too much to one side or too small to the other. If so, the house would break down and in other words, the student will also break down. Let's now say a student named Generic_Name was on the brink of collapsing for his house. He was managing well enough to keep it intact and he didn't have time for an activity. Now that the principal of the student forces all students to take an extracurricular activity, what do you think would happen to his house? I would know. His house would break down; Therefore, Generic_Name could not handle it anymore and gave up. Like I said before, no teacher or principal would want their student to quit so forcing to have an extracurricular activity on students would not end up well at all.\n\nI believe that everyone should have a right to choose what they want.\n\nIn school and everywhere. Giving up though, should not be a choice. Whether its having to play a sport for school, working on a job, whatever it is. We should not be forced to have an extracurricular activity because it prevents choice, gives more stress, and it has the potential to make students stop trying to learn and give up. A little thing, like needing to participate in a school activity, could and can have a big impact on us people.",

    Essay: "Generic_Name\n\nGeneric_Name\n\nEnglish Honors 8 3.11.2020\n\nDear Principal,\n\nI have heard that there is a new rule being put into place making it so that everyone is required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, clubs or sports or a musical instrument, etc, but what happens if students cannot make it to the activity? What will happen when there are things or important issues that come up causing them to miss the extracurricular? I disagree with putting this rule into action because there are many reasons it isn't helping all students and here are some of my thoughts on why I think it shouldn't be a rule.\n\nSome of the students families in school might be struggling with financial issues or aren't as financially inclined at the time being and might have a hard time keeping up. Making parents spend the money to pay for the extracurricular activity rather than paying for more important stuff isn't something we should be promoting or making a requirement.\n\nParents work. You work. Teachers work. Most adults work. With that being said, some parents can't take off work to take their children to the sport or club that they participate in because they don't have time and their work is important to help support the family. Along with parents not having time, students and kids can struggle with time and not being able to make it to the extracurricular. Homework and schoolwork can be a big deal to us. It affects the grade point average and then colleges and then your career as an adult. Although, that might seem far fetched but that's how others think and that's how some plan. Students might need tutoring and help and having to participate in an activity can take away that time.\n\nI do sports and play instruments. I always have, but it's been a choice for me to participate in each of them. I once did four, but that was too much for me so I stopped one. Having the option to stop or not do an activity is something every one of us needs. People like doing new things and trying them out but to others it frightens them. Thats how it is with requiring the participation in an extracurricular activity. Some like doing things and getting out and trying different things but others find it a struggle and unnecessary to do. While I see that you are trying to help and think that this is the right option and should be something necessary I think that other families can find it is a hassle and that making kids participate in extracurricular shouldn't be required but more encouraged as a choice that is fun and new. I hope you take this into consideration.\n\nBest,\n\nGeneric_Name",

    Essay: "You've probably heard the saying, \"Try new things.\" You may be tired of hearing it, but it's actually a good thing to do. Being in extracurricular activities is a way to try new things that you might not have known you like. I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you can explore something you haven't before, you can make friends, and you might find that it's something you enjoy.\n\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity allows you to explore different options that you haven't before. Trying new things is a good way to see what you like and dislike. You could realize that you love to play sports through extracurricular activities. You could also gain experience. Having experience in different fields can be helpful for academic and life purposes. Participating in an extracurricular activity might be helpful for the future. It could help with getting a job and it could end up being your career path. Getting the opportunity to explore new things is a reason you should participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nMaking friends is also a bonus when you are in an activity. You can find people with similar interests as you. Starting conversations with others is easier if you're in the same activity as them. You could have fun while participating with others. Doing things with other people can make you enjoy the activity more. Participating is also an opportunity for you to meet new people you wouldn't have known if you weren't in an extracurricular activity. You could make long lasting friendships you wouldn't have made if you didn't participate. Being in an extracurricular activity is a fun way to make new friends.\n\nThe downside is that you would be forced to be in an activity. If you are forced to do something, it can make the activity less fun. However, you could find that the activity is something you really like to do. You can find out new things about yourself or find a new hobby. Extracurricular activities are outlets for you to find new things that you enjoy.\n\nI think that students should participate in an extracurricular activity. You get to explore different things, you can make new friends, and you could find that the activity you're in is something you like to do. Even though you would be forced to participate, extracurricular activities are something everyone can enjoy.",

    Essay: "I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it is an excellent way to find interests in leisure time, improve people's social and health lives, and it has an important role in serving the community and academic success.\n\nFirst of all, many students, especially teenagers, spend a vast amount of time on social medias and cellular devices. It may lead to negative consequences such as lack of self-control and self-management, imperfect grades, and even cyberbullying. Before students become mature enough to handle their own situations, adults should be the supervisors and help them get on the right track. Sometimes it is acceptable to force people to on a certain task for their own benefits. Therefore, extracurricular activities is a great option when it comes to after school life. Students may seek their true interests through these experiences and even more, find the purpose of their lives. For instance, a student who participates in a the student council may find a big interest in politics or management; another student who works on the yearbook might seek a great favor in arts and photography. Moreover, there is a possibility that some people can target what they want to major in for the future.\n\nAdditionally, extracurricular activities may contribute to students' health and social lives by creating opportunities such as teamwork and group projects. Besides focusing on school grades, students should also pay attention on developing relationships and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, all of these are going to be helpful for having great experiences in the society. Many students crave for a sense of belonging and they often find unexpected gains in extracurricular activities such as friendship or a healthy life style. For example, playing sports can exercise your body and strengthen your muscles, when people get older, it can even prevent typical diseases for a longer life span. Also, sport teams often develop communication and teamwork skills, through these activities, students are able to make new friends by talking about topics that they are interested in, and these relationships can also be a source of strength when people come into challenges and difficulties in life. It is a positive way for students to be physically and mentally prepared for the future.\n\nFurthermore, extracurricular activities is a nice way to contribute to the school and it can even be beneficial to academic success. School provides an educational environment for students and students can participate in activities such as school board or the announcements and news program to serve back to the school. In a way, it has the same meaning and purpose as community service, it advocates for serving others and offers many experience that are helpful to the society. On the other hand, participating in extracurricular activities may serve as a great advantage in high school or college applications, every school looks forward to accepting students who are willing to spend effort on things that they are interested in, and at the same time know the importance of serving back to the community.\n\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities have many benefits for students' academic and after school lives such as finding one's personal interests, adding more values to one's social and health life, and lastly, serving the community while being grateful for nice things in the world. With all these advantages, I think it would be a beneficial decision to suggest students to engage in extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "Students have an increased chance of getting into to trouble if they aren't occupied by something good. For example, an extracurricular activity.\n\nFor example sports or clubs provided at the school. Extracurricular activities are not just for fun but for learning,experience and building the confidence of one another.\n\nExperiences are a crucial part of life. That's what you use to build yourself in the future. For example when I was in kindergarten, we were playing with blocks . I had a blue red and purple castle. It was built so high , it almost reached the ceiling. When my teacher called for snack time, I got up and we all traveled to the cafeteria like a school of fish. While I was munching on my goldfish and sipping on my apple juice, Generic_Name had snuck back to the classroom and knocked down all the kids castles and went back to the cafeteria. When we got back to the classroom we were horrified. Everybodies blocks that were once formed into beautiful castles, were now sad little piles of colors. When the teacher had saw what happened she looked at Generic_Name and said \" Where were you during lunch?\" He burst into tears and explained why he did it. \" I didn't mean to I was just so angry because my castle wouldn't stay up so II'm knocked ours down. I'm so sorry you guys ,\" Afterwards he got sent to the principals and didn't come back until tomorrow. From that experience, I learned that just because you can't make it doesn't mean you have to stop others, just ask for help.\n\nIn extracurricular activities you have the chance to learn from others. For example the first extracurricular activity I took was dance. I had a lot of fun in that class. I learned new techniques from the older kids and I now am able to pass those steps to the younger ones when I get older. On the first day however, I was nervous. I thought they wouldn't like me . I thought they'd judge me. To my surprise, when we did dances I was always shy because we are all here to do the same thing dance freely, so I quickly gained my confidence an started getting to work going \"Full-out\" which leads me to my next point.\n\nPeople are always lowering other's self esteem because of how low theirs is. They think that if someone's is higher then theirs, they are going to be targeted. That's not always true . For example when I first started going to extracurricular activities, I didn't know anybody. I walked in the library with books in my hand and a nervous look on my face . I sat ow at a table alone when a girl and her friend walked over . They asked if they could sit there and I said sure. We got along quite well I made them laugh they made me laugh and we had a fun time so we got each others phone numbers and started talking all the time. Since then, I have met some amazing new friends that will always be there for me when need them .\n\nI believe that it is most important for my principal to make it mandatory that every student participate in atleast one extracurricular activity. The experience is amazing an your confidence and friendships will increase which can lead you to a great school year.",

    Essay: "So our principal has made a new rule that everyone must do an extracurricular activity. This is debated by people. Do these extracurricular activities benefit kids?\n\nI agree with my prinicipal. This is a great idea, a healthy way of school for students. The students get to meet new people and possibly make new friends, and if they join a club or a team with their friends they can play with them. For sports they get to work together as a team and do their best. For clubs they can solve issues or help out the school with things like the yearbook club and student council. These clubs and sports teams are very fun with friends and meeting new people and making friends is even better!\n\nThis also gives something for students to do. Instead of going home and immedietly playing video games or waiting for the weekend this gives students an opportunity to do something after school instead of going home and getting bored. This also makes students more social and talkative. By having to work with new people and building relationships with people and this is where you make new friends! By having good social skills and being able to be coached or cabable of working with others helps you get known as a fun person to play or work with in clubs. Also if you are good at it it's even better!\n\nThis can also help the school. With clubs this can help the school get things done like the yearbook and the student council can make decisions on what to move forward with. Sports can help raise money for the school with fundraisers, and their success might help too. This also helps the school improve by solving problems like fixing broken items or getting jerrseys etc. When the school doesn't have many problems than everyone is ok and nobody is unhappy with the school\n\nHaving after school activities is good. This helps kids and helps the school. Kids get tthe opportunity to make friends, play fun sports and help the school. This benefits lots of people and will make people happy.",

    Essay: "If the principle decided on if everyone had to do an activity school would be not in good shape including that there is many reasons why this shouldn't happen. People who are in school has a higher chance of not liking school than liking it. Students have more pressure doing extra activities it is just like adding more school to school. There's more reasons for which this idea is unreliable.\n\nThere has been studies proven on which students don't like the facts on which school starts at 7:30 am in middle school which students have to wake up about at 6:00 for the bus so people have been thinking to start school somewhere near 10:00 or 9:00 which that also is aggravating of an idea because that would cause school to end at like 5:00. Some students do like school then they will volunteer for these activities there for students shouldn't be forced to do these activities. Doing sports takes time from doing homework which benefits your actual education. School is roughly about 6 hours and 45 minutes on which this goes for more than half the year and estimated students get 2 and a half months break.\n\nThere is no time to do any activities in school so that means the activities are after school. as proven this will basically add more time to school since everyone has an activity after school. The fact that most students don't like school it should mean that the principal won't give them extra work for things they may not like even though they can choose their activity, maybe all of their favorite activities are taken so they have to find an activity they don't like. this constructs the purpose on behalf that students should not be forced to do activities.",

By having students participate in activities, you are helping students become more aware to choices out there and develop more interests.\n\nAlso, courage levels are important to the choices of your students.

Students should have the right to choose what they want and what they dont want,because it would not be fair. For example,The students needed stay after school for an activity but they couldn't go. The extracurricular activity's are great sometimes because you have more time to hang out with your friends and stuff,but when they dont let you then thats when students get mad. I would not join an activity because when i get home i dont have time to do all my stuff at home. Students get annoyed when teacher tell them to do something they dont want to.\n\nAll the schools from Generic_City have good and bad rules. They dont let you do what you want to do even sometimes you get in trouble for not going to your activities. Students often dont have time to be doing activities or they dont have much important to them. Also they can be scared to go because their scared to get bulled by someone. Their are many reasons why students should not participate in activities. If a student picks a sport like soccer they can get hurt in many ways and in some other sports. People get bored when their just sitting their listening to the teacher. They also can get distracted easily and then they get in trouble for talking. The teachers can also be to much they get mad if your chewing gum in class and then they be like \"IM GOING TO GIVE YOU A REFFERL FOR CHEWING GUM.\"\n\nThe teachers can make some other fun activity's so the students can enjoy there time with there friends. Some students can be lazy to even think about doing activities. I mean a lot of people out there can have different ideas some dont think the same like others do. The county should make more activities that are excited so students can go and learn more stuff so they can understand that maybe activities can not be that bad. Students may look like their distracted but maybe their not,maybe its because they dont know how to do something in the activity. Thats why I wouldn't agree to this decision that the principal made.",

    Essay: "In most schools, students are staying after school doing after school activities. But, sometimes students aren't able to do any after school activities. Some of the reasons could be that the student may already do something after school or, the students may not be able to do the extracurricular activities physically or mentally. Another reason is the student simply just does not have the time to do any after school activities.\n\nOne reason, could be that students may not have the time to do any after school activities because they may already do something after school. For instance, they may have to help around with chores or they may have to babysit etc. There are a lot of things a student have if they can't do any after school activities. Like, he or she may have to do a project, do missing work or have to do homework. Most likely, they just physically or mentally can't do any extracurricular activities.\n\nOne reason, could be that a student could have therapy or a regime that they have to keep up after school. Most likely, they could be disabled physically or mentally that make them unable to stay after school for any activity. Also, sometimes student just simply can not stay after school for any activity.\n\nAnother reason could be they just cant stay after school. For instance, this could be due because of transportation reasons like, he or she are getting picked up by there parents or sibling or guardian who ever and it could be that after the person who picked up the student have to work or where ever that is important.\n\nI know that having an after school could be fun and healthy for the student but sometimes its just could not be possible for the student.\n\nEven though, some students may not be able to do any after school activities. There are still a lot of other students that can do extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "I believe all students should have a hobby. Whether it is football, photography, or chess club, extracurricular activities have many positive impacts on students. It adds positvity to the environment kids go to five days a week. I support my principal's decision. I know in my heart that Generic_School will improve drastically by this decision. I agree in having required extracurricular activities because it allows students to be active in their school community, it helps students to find new activities that they will enjoy, and it encourages friendship with students who have similar interests.\n\nTo begin, having all students participate in activities doubles, and even triples the amount of support in our school community. Clubs or sports with lesser students will have many helping hands thanks to the extracurricular requirement. Clubs such as school beautification, girl power, and art will have enough members to paint more positive murals. We would be able to have our own lacrosse and field hockey teams instead of having to put students on the Generic_School junior varsity teams. More members also means more students can help collect donations or start fundraisers for the program that they are in. The money would help to fund trips and supplies.\n\nSecondly, it lets students find an extracurricular that they enjoy. With activities being a requirement, students can explore different things that they have never done before. For instance, maybe a student has never been apart school extracurricular before. This gives them an array of options. They decide to join the soccer team. They will either enjoy the sport or they will not. If they enjoy playing soccer, that is wonderful! They will be happily supported by the other teammates. If they don't have fun it is not a bad thing. Maybe they will try student council, cheer-leading, or the international language club. Finding out that they don't like doing a certain activity encourages putting an effort in finding a new one, while finding out they do like a certain activity will inspire them to participate in that activity on a daily basis.\n\nLastly, it introduces students who have similar interests. Sometimes students have trouble making friends in their everyday classes. Maybe they are the only kid in language arts who is obsessed with animals. This causes the student to feel alone. Then, they join the animal lovers club. It's like a whole new world for them. They get to interact with other people who love animals as much as they do. The student is immediately introduced and accepted by the other club members. They even become friends with a group of student who loves the same animal as they do. Extracurricular activities will bring together so many students, and it might even be able to end cliques and a majority of bullying.\n\nTo conclude, Mr. Generic_Name's decision make extracurriculars a school wide requirement was quite wise. I cannot wait to see how much the school will gradually improve. It may take weeks or months, but I know our school will benefit from it in the end. Hopefully all the activities won't be completely filled before I myself can join! In the end,I am glad we decided to enact the extracurricular requirement because it helps the school community, it allows students to explore different activities, and it promotes friendship between students with similar interests.",

Anybody can find a club that fits their personality, and at the end of the day makes them a better person. These activities might even lead you to new friends, and a new passion that you would possible want to pursue latter in your life. That is why I agree with the principal, students should participate in an extracurricular.\n\nIf you are in middle school and love sports, but can't play yet, you can manage the sport of your choice. Managing is a great way for middle school athletes to get involved. You can meet the coaches, hangout with the team, help set up different drills, and participate in the sport you love. You also get to interact with many people who share the same interest as you. On game days you can ride the bus with the team and even help with games! Managing is a way for you to get to know the coaches,and the game to a better understanding while having fun, and once you are in high school you will know some of your teammates already. Other sport activities are optional to, like training . You can work with some of the high school coaches and get designed training for that specific sport. These are only a few of many great activities for teens to do.\n\nTheater is a huge way to interact with your school. If you decide to so theater you can make skits, and even big plays. theater is an amazing way to interact with people. you can be whoever you want to be, and as loud as you can be. Middle school theaters put on plays like Harry Potter, Cinderella, Cat in the Hat, and some original plays. If you want to be in a play you have to audition . When rehearsals begin you stay after school every day with the cast. Being in theater is awesome, you get to hang out with your friends and make an awesome play for the school to see. Theater is a great way to work with your community. You do projects with your friends on making signs to put around the area so people know what play is going to be preformed. The cast is not the only people working on the play. If you dont enjoy being on stage you can be on the stage crew. stage crew is very crucial to theaters. If you like to work with tech you can work with the lights and sound. If you like art you can paint the set, and if you dont like any of those you can be somebody who folds brochures and makes fliers, or a bouncer,somebody who opens doors and make sure the play runs smoothly.\n\nI have just listed some activities that are really popular. Any activities are good activities though. Instead of going home you could enjoy the thrill of sports, or the relaxation of painting. It is good to get one activity in per year. The extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and relaxing to students. All activities are given to us so we get a break and get to have fun with whatever we are doing. Not all of them are classes, in fact most of them are different categories of activities so everyone finds on that fits their personality. The principal has a good reason to make students do these activities. Although you might not be thrilled about staying after school, at the end of whatever you are doing you will be happy you did.\n\nAlthough you might think extracurricular activities are boring. You will most likely find on you enjoy. These activities are important to get involved in. There are hundreds of activities you can get involved in. One activity is all it takes to find your passion,weather it is sports, art, or theater. Participating in one extracurricular is a great thing for all students to do. Instead of sitting down and doing nothing or going home and doing homework for hours you can take a break from all the stress and relax with your friends. Not all schools have the money or opportunities to make any of these extracurricular's happen, so why not at least do one.",

Some students might not want to join any school activity not even if you try to convinced then to.\n\nSome students donÃÂ´t have a ride to pick them up if they participate in a school activity. They couldnÃÂ´t get picked up because, either their parents are at work or doing something very important. So you have to call one of your family members and hope one of them could pick you up. I had to call one of my family members to pick me up because, my mom and dad couldnÃÂ´t pick me up, I was so scared that no one was going to pick me up, but thank god that my aunt came an picked me up. Somtimes you might have to ask one of your friends parents or their older sibling that can drive to take you home.\n\nSome students have little brothers and sisters they have to look after because, their parents have to go to work or their parents have to go do something real quick. For example your parents could go grocery shopping, go on a date and more. Your parents might not want to hire a babysitter to watch your little siblings because, they not trust the person with their kids, so they tell you to watch them. Most likely your parents have to work all week so your mom, or dad just ask you to watch your younger siblings.\n\nSome people have family issues that they have to deal with. For example if one of the family issues was, my parents are all ways are arguing everyday and you have little siblings, wouldnÃÂ´t you go home and protect them and calm them down if they are scared? I would go home and do that if i had young siblings. Some students could have worser issues then that because, their parents could be getting a divorce, one of their parents could be getting abuse or someone could have died in their family and more.\n\nSo that is most of my resends that I disagree about all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school.

    Essay: "The principal has decided that all students should participate in at least one school activity. For example they can participate in sports, SCA member, or even gaming club. Me myself agreed with this decision because we all need to stay active in some type of sport or school activity if not we are not going to be involved in things. Also if you dont like any of the activities talk to your principal about adding some other things that you like.\n\nStudents should try out sports say if you have been practicing basketball or football and you think your good enough to make the team just try out and see if you'll make it. Also as well if you dont play sports but you try out for a team you might just like and get real good at that sport. We even have a better idea say if you can dance or cheer you might can talk to your principal about being your school mascot you might can get some fans,or have a cheer leading team for the sports. Try to talk to your principal about having a concession stand to sell snacks to the players and people who come watch the game. If you are good at keeping record you can be the person who keeps track of the fouls, timeouts, and keeping track of the numbers scored.\n\nThe SCA is when host the school dances or fundraisers. They do school dances by getting it all planed like getting a DJ, food, games, buses. Also they do fundraisers because this is how they get money for school equipment like new PE equipment and better technology so we can have better computers. But the school dances help with these things to. This is why we need all the school dances and fundraisers.\n\nThe gaming club is not a sport but it's competitive thing. The gaming club is for people who does not like to play outside don't like getting hurt. You can compete against people in battle games or sport games.

    Essay: "Extracurricular activities have been around for decades, they've been proven to help students socialize, and keep students active. In my opinion, it is best for every student to be able to experience after school activities in order to find what hobbies they have; or even later on in their life, find out what career they might want to pursue.\n\nAs technology advances, and the times change, the amount of activities readily available for students to participate in, will increase. Today many of those after school, or even in school activities can vary from, sports (football, baseball, soccer, basketball, table tennis), art and photography clubs, councils, donation groups. There are a huge assortment of fantastic groups, clubs, teams, you can choose from, typically they do not require a fee, or any payment upon joining. A great example of an extracurricular activity is, JROTC. JROTC is a program that teaches highschoolers, and sometimes middleschoolers about what you will learn, and what you'll do in the military based on it's respective branch. Not only does it teach the process of basic training, and what's to come, you will learn discipline, respect, honesty, and to be physically ready to get through basic training. Sports can teach you teamwork, and being a good sport, while promoting good health. Creative arts could help students relax, and bring out their artsy side that they didn't know they had, or cannot bring out at home.\n\nI believe it is more important to take part in extracurricular activities if your school doesn't have recess or gym. Back in elementary school, recess was the major part of the day that you would be excited for. That 45 minutes or hour was the peak of the day where you could get your excitement out, talk and play with your buddies, or just relax and nap. Me and many others were quite disappointed when we got to middle school, that recess had been replaced with gym or study hall. Then I remember learning about clubs and after school fun that I could do. For me, this was even better than recess, you had a lot more options than you would with just a playground, maybe a basketball court. Depending on what they school provided, it seemed I had the power of choice. This time around I could chose if I even wanted to stay after school. Staying after school, you can chat, play, with your friends, I think this is a wonderful outlet for people who may be having troubles at home, maybe they don't have friends and they want to find someone to hangout with. School can be the best place, or the worst place for people in need.\n\nIn many ways after school activities are good, however they have their cons. For some, their parents force them into after school activates, regardless if they would like to or not. I believe you should throw yourself into some things and see how you like them, but if a student really does not want to be there, then they should have an alternative to be able to chill instead of forcing them to do an activity they don't want to do. Again, it's for the benefit of the student, not the parents or the school. Bullying could also stand a problem in after school activities, but the truth is, bullying and foul people contaminant every where you will go, even adults in the real world. Bullying, just like world hunger is something that cannot be fixed, we do not live in a perfect utopia, the likes of such are impossible as there will always be bad people. There are though, many things we can do to prevent this from being common in extracurricular activities. You should stray from separating kids, as that can make it easier to gang up on a single group of people, or one person alone. Promoting good sportsmanship and including everyone can keep it on the level side to make sure everyone is having fun.\n\nOverall, after school activities are a great idea if you maybe want to get your mind off things, take a break from what might be slowing you down and beating you up in life. The only way to beat depression is to get up out of your hole, do something to ease your mind, and never get bored. Maybe you just wanna have fun with your friends, and talk, play, plan, with them because you live a great distance from each other. If you want to prepare for the real world, and get ready for what it will mean to serve your country, be apart of your community, contribute to the work force, there are many options that schools provide for you. No matter who you are, where you come from, it doesn't matter, everyone is welcome to participate in extracurricular activities.",

    Essay: "Fun is subjective. Everyone sees fun a different way. For instance, someone might see fun as throwing a ball back and forth with a friend, while someone else finds fun in instant gratification in online video games. Others, on the contrary, find fun in discovering new and innovative ways of counting prime numbers and memorizing absurd amounts of digits of pi. These people also frequently get the short side of the stick when it comes to decisions majorly accepted as fun. This consists of extracurricular activities such as sports and inter murals. Although this is a particularly opinionated based subject, it is also one worth mentioning. I believe that students should not be obliged to take part in extracurricular activities because students are overwhelmed with considerably more important subjects such as mathematics and English, students have a lack of free time as it is, and most people would rather do extracurricular activities at home rather than at school.\n\nPeople are overwhelmed during school with other things besides extracurricular activities. For instance, most students find themselves dumbfounded when trying to reflect on what the teacher has said in the past hour of not being able to focus. This is most likely due to sleep deprivation or stress. One plausible explanation to explain why a student might not get enough sleep at night is because he or she spent too much time studying or doing homework when he or she should have been sleeping. This is a problem not only because of the lack of energy during integral class time, but also because it causes stress. When students suddenly realize that there is an upcoming test the next morning or there is a massive project due the very next day that they have not even taken a crack at, stress is typically a resulting factor. Even if the student does get to sleep early, he or she may not be able to fall asleep or stay asleep the whole night because of the stress caused by the assignment or assignments due. This will only get built upon when adding even one mandatory extracurricular activity. This is a crucial problem occurring to students, but when asked, they are not willing to admit it to authority figures or even their parents. Therefore, students should not be obliged to participate in extracurricular activities because they might already be overwhelmed with seemingly more important subjects.\n\nStudents do not get enough free time as it is. Hypothetically speaking, after coming home from a long day at school, a student might want to play for a bit before getting started on his or her arduous homework. From a brief look at the clock, the student realizes that there is no time to play and decides to start on his or her homework while he or she still can. Because the homework that was given to he or she was too much to handle, he or she still did not manage to finish his or her homework even though he or she did set aside play time. While this is no anecdote, a lot of real students go through this, myself included. This, along with the additional extracurricular activity that is probable to give even more homework, proves that students are already incapable of completing homework assignments because they do not get enough free time to do so. Therefore, adding the mandatory extracurricular activities will only drag down the amount of free time students have to have fun and play.\n\nI may not be the perfect candidate to speak on everyone's behalf, however, I think that most people would rather do extracurricular activities such as sports at home rather than at school. This is probably because no matter how hard they try, the school never executes their plans correctly. Also, if and when someone does do it at home by his or her self, he or she would normally have a lot more fun and feel a lot more accomplished with the activities because there are no limits when it comes to creativity and imagination. Therefore, I encourage imagination by not wanting to have one or more mandatory extracurricular activity at school because the students will probably not like it if the activities were set up by the school.\n\nTo conclude, I do not think that each and every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students grow easily overwhelmed and stressed out over other subjects such as mathematics, students have a lack of free time as it is, and most people who would like to do extracurricular activities would probably like to do them at home by themselves. This is, however, a particularly subjective subject, nonetheless it is worth the mention. I hereby encourage students to be creative and resourceful by doing extracurricular activities as they please!",

All students have something that at least like to do or are good at and could even get better at.\n\nIf you were to do a sport for your extracurricular activity there are tons and tons of reasons why that is a good thing to do. For instance if you did a sport then that will keep you in shape. Another reason is that you can make a lot of new friends that you could become best friends with. If you are anti social doing a sport could help you with that, you could socialize with more people. However if you become very good at the sport that you do you maybe even get a scholarship for going to college witch is very very good. It could also teach you how to become a good teammate and learn how to support people that you try to succeed with. Also It can help block out all the the negative things in your life.\n\nYou could become a Leader at your school. You could do that by joining the school council. If you became apart of the school council that means you could make changes in the school that you and the students think that you could benefit from and you would still be doing a extracurricular activity. If you were to become A school leader you could help kids find what they are good at and what they enjoy to do in there free time. You could also help the kids with to much that they have to do with school and other things such as sports, school ext... that need help with time management if they needed help with it.\n\nExtracurricular activities could also help with stress. It could help you by talking to your friends in the same club or sport that you do to get stuff off your mind, to help you relive or reduce stress. If you dont have many friends and you are stress about it this could help you find friends that have the same interests as you. If you are doing a extracurricular that you enjoy doing that could help relive stress, because you are doing what you love to do. Also helps you get the stuff off your mind that you struggle with.\n\nIn conclusion those are some of the reasons why I think that students should do a extracurricular activity. There are many more reasons why this is good for students. There are reasons why this can be a bad thing but there arn't as many reasons and I think that the good overrules the bad.

    Essay: "So your principal is making your whole school do an extracurricular activity. You haven't chosen which activity that you want to do. So then your principal chooses for you and you really hate the activity that your principal gave you. How would you feel if your principal gave you an activity that you didn't like? Would you just go with it or would you try to get out of the activity?\n\nI agree with the principal because I feel that it is important that kids do extracurricular activity for school. Most kids don't do sports or a extracurricular activity after school because they are to lazy to actually do something active. The average kid after school and when they get home will start watching videos on their phone or they will get right on video games. Extracurricular activities could help students make new friends or the activity could be a learning experience. Say you just moved to a new school and your new school is making you do a extracurricular activity. The extracurricular activity could be a good way for you to make a friend at your new school. Some people might not like doing the extracurricular activity that they choose because they think it is a waste of time, but in the long run they might actually enjoy doing the activity after a while. The activity that the student has chose may not be fun at first but they might start to like it overtime. Extracurricular activities may be more fun for others but overall your getting out of your house and being active and not being a couch potato.\n\nSome extracurricular activity maybe more interesting then others like you might have robotics club and your friend has homework club. They both have different benefits like robotics you get to build things like robots, moving vehicles, and stuff out of legos that you can program. Benefit of homework club is that if you need help with a certain part of your homework someone at school could help you. When you get home you don't have any homework so if you like playing video games you are able to play video games when you home without having to worry about having homework that is due tomorrow. Some students when they get home from school don't do anything, but with the extracurricular program that your school is doing. The students will have something else to do after school instead of just hanging out at home doing nothing. With extracurricular activities going on you have more time to hangout with your friends, but when you are at home the only way for you to communicate with your friends is through Facetime, a phone call, or through text. People that do after school clubs have a better chance of actually trying something new then someone who doesn't do after school extracurricular activity because when you do after school activity or club you are trying something new that you might not have ever tried before. Say you join robotics you are trying something new and trying new things will then make you want to try other new things like other clubs or activities.\n\nSome people might already be busy or doing other activities outside of school. So they might not have time for a school extracurricular activity because they maybe doing a sport and then when they get home they have to do homework then by the time all that stuff is done they have to eat dinner, shower, then go to bed. So a school extracurricular activity maybe to much stuff for that one person to do. What if a student doesn't have a ride home or their parents won't be there in time to pick up the student. The student will just be at school even longer if there parent isn't able to pick then up in time.\n\nSome student may not have time for school after activities because they might have other activities that are more important then school activities. People that have activities might not have them everyday so they could go to the after school activities the days they don't have there sports practice going on or other clubs that aren't related to school.\n\nEven if you have a sport going on you could still try to find time to at least do the extracurricular activity once a week, but if you want to do an after school activity and your sport that great but the principal shouldn't be in charge of what you do after school because the principal is only in charge of you in till that last bell rings for dismissal.\n\nThe principal made it where everyone has to do at least one extracurricular activity. Most the students like that the principal did that but some students are mad that the principal is doing that because some students don't want to be at school any longer then they already have to and some students like having free time after school. Having to do extracurricular activity can be boring for some, but fun for some people. I feel like the extracurricular activity after school would be a good idea for schools to do. So they have more active students instead of having a student that just don't want to do anything and just want to go home and watching videos and be a couch potato. The program would be a good thing for student but not all student like to active and I feel that if they don't dont want to do the extracurricular activity then I think they shouldn't because when a student doesn't want to the activity then they are just hurting them self by not being active and just being lazy. When a student doesn't want to do the active they are just failing them self because they are choosing to not participate in the activity but when you do participate in your activity that you choose you are being successful because when you start something you should always finish. Overall if you like the activity your doing or not don't complain about it just be happy that you get a chance to have a extracurricular activity. Some kids are unable to because they have to do other things. So be grateful that you get a chance to have a extracurricular activity provided at your school.",

    Essay: "Students should be in at least one or more extracurricular activities because they can meet new people and make new friends, find out they are actually really good at the thing they are doing, and they can learn new things about something that they never knew about; in this read you will see why it is good for students to participate in a activity and maybe this will persuade you to join one.\n\nHere is the first reason why students should join activities. Students can make new friends and meet new people if they are in an activity with a group. For example, when I started doing orchestra I made lots of new friends and I met people that I didn't even knew went to my school; also that were in some of my other classes. When I moved up to other orchestras I made more and more friends. I am really glad I joined, because then I wouldn't have met all those people and my friends. Also you might find someone who has the same interests as you do and you can maybe be try and be their friend.\n\nThe second reason why students should be in one or more activities. When students have joined a after school activity or just a during school activity or even an elective. Some students have said that the activities they are in became their new hobbies and they found out that they were actually good at it. If you join a activity and you really like it maybe you can make a career out of it. Isn't that how most famous sports players became so good at the sport and make lots of money. It's because they might have tried out the sport during school or even after. They figured out that they were really good at it. So they tried for leagues and other sport events and made it their career. So maybe if you join an activity you might be surprised and find out you are good at it.\n\nHere is the last reason why I think students should join one or more activities. When people have join and activity they might have learned about something that they never knew was a thing or maybe just something cool to do. For example when you join soccer you can learn lots of tricks and cool things you can do with the ball. Also when I joined orchestra I never knew how to do any cool hand positions and shift up on the strings. But throughout the years of me playing I learned mostly all the things to know. Also I learned about new people who played the same instrument as me. So join something, you can learn lots of new things.\n\nThroughout this whole essay you have read about why students should join a extracurricular activity. Examples like you can learn new things, meet new people and make new friends, and people found out that they were good at the activity. So the next time you see a flier posted up about an activity. Give it a try you might find out that you really like it and find out you are really good at the sport or whatever you choose to do.",

    Essay: "Abraham Lincoln once said, \" it's not about the days in your life, It's about the life in your days.\" Joining the after school program can make each day more exciting. In my past I have done many extra curricular activities such as, rugby, soccer, knitting, and many more, and It's the thing I look forward to most in the day! I think participating in the after school program is good, because you could meet new people and learn new skills.\n\none reason for joining is that you could meet new people. Meeting others is always fun, especially if that person shares the same interests as you. when I was in fifth grade I met one of my close friends in knitting, she shared the same interests as me and even taught me techniques when knitting.\n\nAnother reason is learning new skills. Improving and expanding on your skill set can help you try and learn new things you never thought you would do. When I was in fourth grade my friend signed me up to do rugby, I really didnt want to, but then I tried it out and learned how to play, and till this day rugby is my favorite sport.\n\nI agree that participating in after school can help you make friends and learn new things. I think Abraham Lincoln was right, by doing after school activities you are making your life more eventful. In all I think its is great to join an extra curricular activity.",

    Essay: "The principal has decided to have every student participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These activities can range from joining the sports team for a student's school too serving in student council. I agree with the new rule because extra curricular activities makes students have an identity about who they are as a person in school, it can make students have a good resume for a job they want to do or if they want to get into college, and it can help reduce stress in students from school, from school, family, friends, or anything else by doing the things they love.\n\nFirst, extra curricular activities makes students who they are in school and it gives them an identity. By having a student do an extra curricular activity may even show to other students and teachers about what they strive to do in the future. This is important because it shows teachers and others that a student has pride in what they want to do and that they want to be successful in school and in the future. Along with the academics, students can put their extra curricular activities on their resume which goes to the next point.\n\nExtra curricular activities makes a student's resume above average. By having a student put their extra curricular activities on their resume would make a complete, better resume than just putting what they chose for their core classes. For example, students will have to make a resume for a college they want to apply or if they want to get any sort of job. Having a more impressive resume with extra curricular activities would make the student or person more likely to get into that college or the job that they wanted. It can make the process less stressful which goes to the last and final point.\n\nExtra curricular activities can help reduce stress in a student from school or anywhere else they get stressed from. Extra curricular activities lets students take their mind off what stresses them out like school, family, or friends and makes them do the things they love. It may even help with academics because they are not so stressed and nervous about their classes. It can make students have more breathing room about school life and not feel like they have tons and tons of work to do.\n\nIn conclusion, extra curricular activities makes students have an identity about who they are in school, it can improve their resume for college or if they wanted to get a job, and lastly it can help students reduce stress by having them do the things they want to do and getting their mind off school work, tests, and their core academics. All these reasons can make a student more successful in school or in the future for when they get a job. No matter what grade a student is in school, they should do extra curricular activities. These are all the reasons for why students should do extra curricular activities.",

    Essay: "Do you enjoy sports? Do you enjoy other activities outside of school? I think that students should be required to join at least one extracurricular activity because the student could potentially have a better time at finding a career, it may help them with academics, and it can give the student something to do.\n\nOne reason is that it would help students pursue a career that they may want in the future. Maybe a student would like to go for a career that school doesn't teach. An example would be a photographer. If the student enjoys sports, they could join a sports team to get better at it and know more on that sport. If the student wants to do a profession that includes music or instruments, then an extracurricular class could help them achieve that.\n\nAnother reason why an extracurricular class might assist a student is that it could help the students with education. If a student is having a hard time in class, they may want to join an academic activity so that it could help them. It would give the student a better working habit and help them strengthen their memory. They could also use the activity for studying for a quiz or test.\n\nThe final reason is that it would give the students something to do and they may find it enjoyable. The activity can range from sports, to an instrument, and to an academic activity. Many students go home and they don't have anything to do, so they could join an activity. Many people say that students should be able to choose what they would like to do, but I believe that at least one extracurricular class would help students a lot.\n\nTherefore, students should join an extracurricular for educational help, gives the students something to do, and helps them with their career in the future. Extracurricular activities can benefit a child a lot. So I agree with my principle that all students must be in a extracurricular activity.",

    Essay: "Kids now a days want all the free time they can get, and during that free time they will do as they please whether it is playing games, reading books, watching TV, hanging out with friends, or just napping. Although the problem with that is those students are not getting outside of their houses, but requiring students to take an extracurricular activity can fix that. Having students take extracurricular activities can benefit them in many ways. For example it allows students to try out more activities to see whether they like it or not, it can give them practice for a future job, and many students already have an activity they do.\n\nSome students always did the same things not wanting to try anything new, but by forcing them to try something new they may find something new they like to do, and find others who like the same things. There was a story I heard from a guy, that when he was younger he talked about how he always hated how his mom would make him go out and try out many different activities from a wide range of chess to ballerina. During that time he learned that he loved math and so he wanted to become a math teacher. This story was not special though because there are many more out there like this one, but the main point of all of them is that sometimes stepping out of your bubble might a lot more fun than it looks. By having them participate in these activities it gives them that stories along with a new hobby to do. It may even inspire some and let them find out what their interested in.\n\nFrom the start a few students know what they want to do for a job like become a nurse, police officer, psychologist, journalist, or even a football player, and by having them go try out activities it can give them a chance to out one of those jobs and get some experience from them. For example students who want a career in sports could get to practice it with other people who feel the same way about it. Then from there they get to experience what it is like to be part of a sports team having to compete against other teams that are as or more competitive than them. Another example is for journalism the student can work in a school paper making editorials for it or editing them. They could also sign up for a program where they help out other students with their writing. Having experience is a good thing in many ways like it can help you with a future resume or get you a better job. At the end of the road, it might help more to have the extra practice because once you get into the real job your simple mistakes could cost you a job, and some people have already realized that.\n\nAt an early age parents started forcing their kids to start trying out different activities like sports, math, reading, music, and much more. Their intentions were for them to find something that they like to do, and once they found out what they loved to do they usually wanted to continue it. As a result of that some students have been doing extracurricular activities for quite a while, which makes it easier for them to complete their task. Having a student done with their task means they might feel better knowing that they did something they love and have complete some of their homework because of it. As a result of loving that activity their friends might want to try it out, and then possibly end up liking that activity too.\n\nIn the end having to participate in an extracurricular activity might be more beneficial than it sounds. It gives the students a chance to experience new things and learn more about themselves. While at the same time making new friends and having plenty of fun in the process. It also gives them practice for future jobs by helping improving their skills and just giving them a chance to practice those skills. Another benefit can be for students that already have extracurricular activities because they already know they have fun with it and can help others who do not know what to do for their activities. In conclusion extracurricular activities are very useful whether its to make get practice, find new hobbies, or just continue doing what they love most.",

        "Have you ever wondered where your best friendÂ was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.\n \n Signing up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve rackingÂ but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friendÂ was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.\n \n Theres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after schoolÂ activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.\n \n Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friendsÂ of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.\n \n My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.Â Â",

        "Our principle has recently stated to all the students of SCHOOL_NAME that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity. Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.\n \n Musical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.\n \n Musical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as wellÂ as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.\n \n Another great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.\n \n Finally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.\n \n I stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.Â  Â Â  Â",

        "Students should be able to choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or not for many reasons. Most students are busy and don't want added pressure on top of school work. While kids may want to do extraculliculars they may do out of school activities that can take up their time, or they might have a family to take care of. Many students also a lot of time for homework, which they won't get the time for in an extracurricular.\n \n A reason students student's may not want to do an extracurricular is because they might have out of school obligations. If a student was babysitting or tutoring someone, they wouldn't have time to do extraculliculars because they'd be busy doing another job. It would be unfair to force someone who has another job to do more work, which is why they should have the choice to do an extracurricular activity.\n \n Furthermore, some students could have a family to take care of when they get home. For example, if a student has a younger sibling that needs to be picked up from the bus stop, the student would have to help with that. If they were forced to do an extracurricular, they wouldn't have time to take care of their sibling.\n \n In addition, quite a few students would need more time to do homework, which an extracurricular would prevent them from doing. While some students can finish their homework quickly and have enough time for another activity, a student who takes a long time shouldn't be rushed into doing something else. If they need more time to do their homework, they shouldn't be dragged into doing an activity.\n \n In conclusion, students have out of school activities, family to take care of, and a lot of homework which can make it hard for them to focus on extracurricular activities on top of it. All in all, there are many reasons a student might not want to do an extracurricular. Because of this, a student should be able to have a choice to do another activity or not.",

        "Have you ever been interested in something such as a sport or maybe even science? Activities such as these are offered by schools. Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.\n \n Requiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social.Â Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Being social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.\n \n These activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often go home and sit down to do homework, watch tv, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can go outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also being healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities but there are also other benefits.\n \n Another benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students.Â When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.\n \n In conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",

        "Does sitting inside and doing nothing but homework and chores all day sound exciting? Or would you rather have an opportunity to do fun activities with other people, making friends and improving your health along the way? If the latter sounds like the more appealing option, than you should support our principal's decision to make taking an extracurricular program mandatory. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity is the perfect choice for our school. That is because it opens up new and unexpected opportunities, provides an outlet to make new friends, and helps improve your physical and mental well being.\n \n You should support the requirement of an extracurricular because it opens up fun and enjoyable activities that you might not have come across if not for this new policy. A very sporty kid might never know that he really enjoys being on the student council unless he tries it, and it is unlikely that he would try it any other way. The same thing works inversely, a book-smart kid could really have a great time playing basketball or football and never know it unless he tries it. The new opportunities can also help your in-school life by helping you learn about certain topics that you are struggling in or by providing service hours to contribute towards your required amount. The activity would also be a place to go every time you would rather not go home or if you just preferred to stay after school with your friends.\n \n The same way that this policy provides an outlet to new activities that you might not have found otherwise, it also paves the way to making you friends that you wouldn't have been friends with in any other situation. If you are a new addition to a certain group and you feel lost with how much more accustomed everyone else is to the group, you could make friends with an elder statesmen type of the group, in a mentor-apprentice kind of way. Many times, you could find people who are in the same situation that you are. If you got to know them and started working together with them, you could both benefit by learning how the group works. Overall, it would just be a fantastic way to gain friends, especially with people who are having a hard time getting to know new people.\n \n Another great way that this program is going to help is how it improves your physical and mental health. School can get very stressful at times, and the amount of homework, studying, test-taking, and other school things on top of the everyday teenage problems that you have can start to feel draining, like a heavy weight being pushed down on you. Extracurricular programsÂ relieve a lot of that stress by being a place where you can slow down a little bit and be more involved in things you actually enjoy being involved in. The physical activities, such as baseball or basketball, are a great place to get some exercise in to improve your physical life. A lot of students this age have it rough in that they might not have a lot of friends or people to talk to, so just a simple activity like the yearbook club could help relieve an immense amount of emotional weight off of that student by actually giving them someone to talk about their problems to.\n \n The intelligent choice by our principal to make at least one extracurricular program mandatory is an incredibly beneficial choice to all who are involved. It is a policy that gives people new chances to find something that they like doing, helps students make friends with people that they likely wouldn't have otherwise, and improves the physical and mental health of those students who need the improvement. If you are for the well-being of students and the developmental growth of the people who are the future of our nation, then you should be for this policy.Â",

        "Do you ever wish that you could have the chance to do a fun activity during or after school? Some schools are making students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can start new friendships, and in could be fun.\n \n Doing extracurricular activities can start new friendships. If you find someone with the same interest as you, then you two may become friends. It can be hard for people to meet new friends, but if you find someone with a similar interest then it could be easier to become friends with them. Secondly you guys could do activities together. If you two were to both to play an instrument, then you could practice together. Doing an extracurricular activity could give you topics to talk about with friends. If your at lunch one day and you run out of things to talk about, your extracurricular activity could be a good topic. If you miss out on an opportunity for an extracurricular activity, then you could be missing out on an amazing friendship\n \n Participating in extracurricular activities could be fun. first off there are field trips. Why wouldn't you want to skip a day of school and hang out with friends on a fun field trip? Also you get to do something you enjoy. It can give you a little extra time doing what you love. Lastly it can open up new opportunities. Things like band and orchestra may have festivals or auditions that you could do. Extracurricular activities can give you lots of chances to have fun, and enjoy school a little more.\n \n However, some people may say that students will lose interest. They say picking the wrong topic could lead to a year of being board. This could make students dislike the class or not want to go to it. Although, most students say that they enjoy their extracurricular activity, and even if its not their favorite class, they don't dread going to it. For example if a student liked science class more than yearbook, that doesn't mean that the student doesn't want to go to school. But if a student really didn't like the class, then they would know in the future not to pick it again. It would at the least give a student direction on if they would want to do that activity again. Even though people say that kids will lose interest in the activity they choose, students will always be able to get something out of it.\n \n Having to do an extracurricular activity could lead to new friendships and a year of fun. Being able to experience a extracurricular activity can be a great way to open yourself up to new things, and try different activities. You'll never know what you missed out on if you don't take an extracurricular activity.Â",

      essay:
        'Across the nation, nearly 98% of schools have offered extracurricular activities for their students, but less than half of that 98% have mandated participating in one. In many schools worldwide, extracurriculars have been known to both help and hurt students - they can lead to staying up late making up for lost time, or they can lead to winning awards and even scholarships. Overall, I believe that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities... and I think you might just agree.\n \n First of all, mandating that students participate in after schoolÂ activities could improve kids\' work ethic. In fact, a study titled ""Extracurriculars and Students"" by Professor James Wood at UVA proves this. Wood found that 65% of students who participated in extracurriculars said they enjoyed the additional challenges that were presented to them, and actually continued to work harder and challenge themselves not only in their education, but also in the workforce. This means that teens and kids who entered after schoolÂ clubs and sports teams worked harder and were able to learn how to overcome obstacles and challenges. This also goes to show how students that entered extracurricular activities did indeed improve their work ethic. In general, I think you\'l find that this is important because it shows how adolescents were able to benefit from after schoolÂ activities.\n \n Secondly, requiring students to join extracurricular activities could help students get into better colleges. Don\'t believe me? Well, a statement released by Harvard University said that 80% of colleges look for (and accept) students who participated in one or more extracurricular activities. To put it simply, after schoolÂ activities have been known to assist students in getting into better schools. This relates because it shows how kids and teens who entered after schoolÂ activities could manage getting into excellent colleges and create a better future for themselves. This matters due to how it shows that extracurriculars can broaden the horizon for students.\n \n But that\'s not all. It\'s actually been shown that clubs and teams could improve a students\' health. A professional from Johns Hopkins said in an interview, ""...Students who participated in activitiesÂ after schoolÂ were reported to have a better attitude, more motivation in and outside of school, and possessed an overall healthier lifestyle than their peers who did not join any extracurriculars."" In other words, adolescents who joined activitiesÂ after schoolÂ tended to be in better condition than those who decided not to participate in any clubs or join any sports teams. This displays how students have been able to thrive and even better themselves thanks to extracurriculars. Overall, I think you\'ll find this important because it shows how kids and teens can greatly benefit from after schoolÂ activities.\n \n However, some might argue that students should not be mandated to take part in extracurricular activities, and say that teens may already have a ""full plate"" and thus become stressed. A statistic from the Teens and Mental Health Welfare Society revealed that 48% of students who participated in after schoolÂ activities reported an increase in stress levels. To put it differently, close to half of the kids they talked to felt stressed due to their extracurriculars. This also demonstrates how a few students are actually pressured by their after school activities. Ultimately, extracurricular activities may stress students.\n \n While that might be true, there\'s no denying that after school activities can also teach kids to lessen their stress by learning to budget their time. In fact, I personally was able to learn how to budget my time between school, family, friends, and extracurriculars. While I didÂ have a lot on my plate at first, my extracurriculars like sports, newspaper, and a few of my other hobbies enabled me to learn how to equally set aside time to complete all of my tasks in a timely manner, and still have time to relax. To put it in an alternate way, my after school activities were able to teach me an important skill that I\'d be able to use for many years to come. You\'ll see that this shows that, truly, extracurriculars can teach students how to budget their time effectively. Ultimately, my extracurricular activities taught me an important life skill that could benefit me in many area of my life.\n \n In the end, I think that we should mandate participating in extracurriculars, as it could improve kids\' work ethic, assist students in getting into good colleges, and even keep them healthy. Imagine a school with no after school clubs or teams offered to students; kids would be bored, unhappy to go to school with no chance to socialize or get active, and, most importantly, no chance to broaden their horizon and truly reach their full potential.',

        "Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity such as a sport or a club. I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because it helps build friendships, raise your low grades, and allows you to experience new things.\n \n The first reason after school activities are beneficial is that they can build a strong and lasting friendship. I remember when I was in elementary school and my mom signed me up for afterÂ schoolÂ basketball. The first few days and even weeks I hated it. I had no friends there or even someone I had seen before. I was scared and shy. Most of the kids were way older than me and looked huge. Most days I sit on the sideline watching them, wishing I could be that good. Suddenly the tallest kid of them all walks up to me and asked if I would like to join them in a game. I was in shocked and happy at the same time. I told the boy I would love to join. every day after that for three years I played with them after school. Eventually me and that boy became best friends and didnt do anything without each other. We played basketball together, watched movies, played cops and robbers, and had sleepovers. Five years later we are still best friends.\n \n The second reason after school activities are beneficial is because they can help raise your grades and test scores. Studies show that students who participate in homework clubs and study clubs generally have higher test scores. This means the students who have higher grades can get into better colleges, and students in better colleges can get higher paying jobs. From just attending after school homework clubs students have already made a step towards their goals of getting a good high paying job to support their family.\n \n The third reason after school activites are beneficial is because they allow students to experience new things. At my middle school we have so many different clubs and activities that everyone can find something they enjoy. I wish I could experience every single club we have but that is just not possible. Before I joined the cooking club I could only use a microwave and toaster. The amazing teacher taught me how to bake and make really fancy dishes for family gatherings or holidays. Before this class my Mom and Grandma cooked for Christmas. Now that I am able to help it feels wonderful because it is more time that I can use to bond with my family and friends.\n \n In conclusion I agree that every student should participate in a after school activity because they are great places to build friendships, improve your grades, and experience new things.

        '""Good morning students, this is your morning announcements. This is your principle speaking. I would like to make an announcement that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity this year. Thank you for listening."" ""That sounds like a great idea. I can do track this year,"" I said. ""I can do drama club this year,"" said the girl that sat behind me. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.\n \n Making friends is something that everyone wants to do during the school year. While playing a sport, you can make good friends, and do the sport you really like. When I did track last year, I made many great friends. The friends you make in school, might have a chance to grow up to still being one of your best friends. Making new friends can help increase your social life and have someone to talk to. Studies show that people that have many friends, tend to live longer, and have a happier life. But people that have don\'t have any friends, shows that they don\'t live as long. Doing clubs can also have a chance to make many friends. By doing drama club, theater club, or a robotics club, new people that you meet might have the same interests as you, and the two can share things they like to do and do as a hobby. This creates bonds with other people and groups. These bonds can eventually create friendships.\n \n Doing sports in something people really like to do as a hobby. They can be physical sports or non-physical sports that they can participate in. People also like to be active in clubs such as the yearbook club, drama club, or even the robotics club. Extracurricular activities are supposed to be fun and active, so students can have fun. Competing in sports is something athletes enjoy because of the competition with the other teams, and to see who is the better team. Clubs also compete with other clubs, including the robotics club. They build their machine, and then they compete to see which school has the better machine. Being active in activities would be fun for all students because they involve students being active and having them do fun activities.\n \n By doing many activities may spark someones mind that they want to do what they want in the future. If a student does drama club or theater in school, they mightÂ try out for the activity in high school, or do a play as their career. If a student plays football in middle school, they might try out in high school and get a scholarship to play in college. Then, they can get drafted into the NFL as their career. It\'s a hard task, but anything you put your mind to, you can do it. If the student doe not want to play a sport, be in the yearbook club, or do drama, they can run for student council. This may have the student want to run for student council and win. Running for student council includes many things you would to in other activities, including competition, planning,and confidence. This may have the student be interested in politics. They could even run for an election when they grow up.\n \n In conclusion, I think it would be a great idea for the principal to have all student participate in extracurricular activities. In addition, I was on the track team for two years an I made many friends because of trying out. I also got to learn more about sports and I know many people would want to do these activities for a career. If the principal made us do at least one extracurricular activity this year, that would have students make new friends, be active in activities they like, and help get into a class or what to do to make this into a career.

        "The Principal is making all the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity and while some people may think that this is the greatest thing,and that they are going to love it,others may think that this was a huge mistake and that they won't do any good for them. I think that people need to try an extracurricular activity to get a feel for it. Sure some students may try out for a sports team or a team in general,but they are never finding out their true potential and will leave it in the dust. I think the Principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity because you can make friends,find something you didn't know you were good at till now,and make a living out of it.\n \n The principal should let everyone take a extra curricular activity is because you can make new friends. You can make new friends by talking to the people in your activity. You can find people and become friends by talking to them,becoming really close to them,and becoming friendly with them. You can also find people that you have in common. There's people that I have met that have the same likes,interests,and dislikes,and we became really great friends just by having a few things in common,so you guys should try finding someone and seeing if you have a lotÂ of things in common with him or her. You can also find your future best friend or your soon to be best friend. You can find a person,hit it off with them,and become best friends in the long run just because of that one extra curricular activity. In conclusion I think you can make new friends in a extra curricular activity by being friendly,finding people who have the same likes and dislikes as you,and find a best friend.\n \n Another reason the Principal should let students take one extra curricular activity because you might find something you didn't know you were good at. You can find something you didn't know you were good at because of the many options that schools have. Over fifty activities in schools around the world! From basketball,soccer,and football,form even cooking. Schools have something that might suit you. So if you don't like soccer or any sports,there's always cooking or Cosmetics. You can make teams and become popular and active. For sports such as soccer and softball,you can make the teams and get popular making a lotÂ of friends in the process. You can make money by trying out for a sport. Once you get into high school,you can earn credits and even a college application which saves a lot of money. I think we should take an extracurricular activity because they have many options,you can be active and popular,and you can make or save money.\n \n I think everyone should take at least one extra curricular activity because you can become know for the best basketball or best soccer player one day. Kobe Bryant and Micheal Jordan are perfect examples of people who started in basketball in probably high school as a extra curricular activity,to one of the Greatest players of all time. On the other Extra curricular activity come off as useless and leftÂ in the dust. People just take it for granted and just want the easy A.They don't try to discover their true potential and leave it in the dust. I think that an extra curricular activity is fun and may or may not get you famous,but on the other hand people just seem to abuse it's power.\n \n In conclusion I think that the principal should let all students take at least one extra curricular activity just because if how fun it is. Taking an extra curricular activity means that you can make new friends and best friends,do something that you didn't know you were good at till now and become popular and active,and be famous just like other famous people around the globe. But one the other hand people just seem to not care. In conclusion I think that the principle should let students take at least one extra curricular activity but not make it a rule so that other people will not feel uncomferable and forced to take an extra curricular activity.",

        "Imagine if you had to do an extracurricular activity at school with no say otherwise. Extracurricular activities are meant for a fun, optional, learning experience. Most schools offer activities for student interests. Students like the option of extracurricular activities because they can participate in their interests if they want to but it isn't mandatory like most other things in school. I disagree that students should be forced to do extracurricular activities because students should have the choice of what they want to do, most students are busy with other things outside of school, and students may not be interested in what their school offers.\n \n Students shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because they should have the choice of what they want to do. Schools offer activities so students can participate in things they want do, not have to do. Being forced to participate in things a student doesn't want to do can stress them out. Most things in school are mandatory so students like not feeling the pressure of being forced to do something. Making students participate in extracurricular activities can have benefits too. It would make them go out and do something and help them learn new skills. In the end multiple downsides outweighs a few benefits. While there may be benefits to forcing students to go and do something, in the end they should have their own choice of what they want to do or not do.\n \n Another reason why students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities is because most students are already busy with other things outside of school. Forcing more upon them would stress them out and make them dislike school. Students already dread each night they go home because of all their homework so making them have even more to do will over stressÂ them leading to depression and lack of effort. While it is good to challenge students to help them find their full potential, overworking them can lead to problems with their health and efforts during school. Extracurricular activities are supposed to make learning fun and help students learn new skills, not make them dread every day of school. Overworking students when they are already busy leads to anxiety and stress which is why extracurricular activities shouldn't be mandatory.\n \n The last reason why schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities is because some students may not be interested in what their school offers. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students discover what their interests are, not force them to do things they don't care for. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students know what they might be interested in doing in the future. If a student doesn't have interest in any of their schools options, they shouldn't be forced to do them. Some students may only have interests in things they can't do at their school. While some students might have interests that their school offers, not everyone does making it unfair for everyone to have to do an activity. If schools make students do things they don't want to, they will start questioning if their schools cares about their opinion or interests.\n \n In the end, students should have the choice of whether or not they want to do extracurricular activities since some are busy with other things and others aren't interested in what is offered. Overall, I have proved why I think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. Between being forced to do extracurricular activities and having a choice, having a choice is definitely the right answer. I chose that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they should be able to make their own choices, even if it isn't always the best answer.",

        "I agree because maybe it could lead to new friendships or relate ableÂ things or a thing with a teacher. For example I had to do an assignment similar to this and I told them all of my most productive activates I could think of and almost everyone was similar to my activities like they do the same activities as I do too. You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activitiesÂ or someone in school that is friends with their friends. If you disagreed with the principals decision you would just do the same routine all year until summer has came and then high school and then that will be the similar routine and then graduation and then you've decidedÂ to go to college and it's another same routine for how long you're gonna be there and then you get a job and it'll be another same routine until you retire and then you just go home and rest until you die, sure it would be similar if you agreed but sometimes you just gotta try what's new what's been going on or how's it going go out with your friends and then you guys get closer and you've decided you guys wanted to hang out and do whatever you want to do.

My reasons for my decision are students can become more successful,and they can prepare for what they want to be when they grow up.\n \n My first reason is, students can be more successful, and by that i mean better grades. nowadays kids grades drop really low because they are late to class,skip school,or don't pay attention, young teenagers miss a lot of information given by their teacher by not doing what they are supposed to.

        'Why Extracurricular Activites Should Be Enforced\n \n What are ways that can help create a stronger and better student? The principal of Generic_School, Generic_Name, had an idea that will only help benefit and strengthen the students which is by assigning every student in the school with the responsibility of having to preform and maintain an extracurricular activity.\n \n Allowing and giving the students a place where they can spark new interests and express themselves can have a tremendous boost to their mental health along with their self-esteem because of the environment they placed themselves in, and the fact that they can express themselves. A recent study done in Harvard, said, ""93% of students that participate in extracurricular activities are 86% happier with themselves and others because the students are given a chance to express themselves, and feel safe from expressing themselves"". A reason that proves why its better for students to have a strong and penetrable mindset is that students with stronger mindsets tend to do better in school. According to a professor from Yale, ""Students with a good mental health do better in school because the students worry less and have a more positive mindset"". Both of these studies prove how beneficial it can be to assign the responsibility to every student of having to maintain an extracurricular activity because in the long run the students will be happier both with themselves and others, and have a better education, along with a stronger mindset.\n \n Students having to preform extracurricular activities can create new friendships, and bonds with people. An example of this would be if a student named Generic_Name was really into football and equally talented to the amount of love he has for the sport. Generic_Name tried out for the football team and he made the team and now played first string wide receiver. Throughout Generic_Name\'sÂ football season he created a lot of close friendships with his teammates because of their strong roots of interest when relating to football. Another reason that supports the thesis of extracurricular activities creating friendships is from a study recently done in Northern Virginia, from the University of Marymount. According to a professor named Albert Finkilstein, ""more then two thirds of people with similar interests become friends because of the mutual interests both parties share"". Albert Finkilsteins research proves that the extracurricular activities can sprout new friendships among the student population of Generic_School. However, a very important effect that pieces together why is is so important for friendships to be made is that students with more friends have a stronger education. According to a study done in Callasbases Florida, ""nearly 80% of students that have friends and are able to ask questions, share emotions with, and lastly feel comfortable with have a stronger education because students can rely on their friends for help with homework because students feel more comfortable asking questions to friends when compared to teachers"". Another positive affect of creating friendships is that there will be a better High School experience for the student because of the friendships made and the trust that was formed. Overall, with creating friendships from the extracurricular activities comes a stronger education, more people to rely on, and overall a better high school experience because of the friendships made and the comfortability made from creating those friendships.\n \n Forcing students to have to be able to balance school work along with an extracurricular activity can be very helpful in the idea of making students have to learn how to maintain efficient time management skills along with being more productive. One reason as to why extracurricular activities can be beneficial and help teach how to be productive of time to students would be that the students can\'t risk to have bad grades because the school of Generic_School is a prestigious private school meaning that the school only accepts the students with the best grades and the students that are willing to work the hardest. According to Generic_School, ""90 % of all students in the school have straight A\'s"", and, "" Any student that doesn\'t have all straight A\'s than can only have at the most three B+ and then the rest straight A\'s"". From how strict the school is with their grades it seems that they are very productive and efficientÂ since they only expect 110% all the time. However, it is easy to slip up or possibly fall behind and the best way to keep the productiveness flowing and for the students to do their homework every nightÂ is to never stop being productive which is why having an extracurricular activity is very beneficial because it helps teach all of the students how to maintain productiveness and how to have good time management skills. An example of a student being productive with their time would be to go home and do their homework, and to then think ahead and piece the amount of projects that could be coming up and when to do them and then align the upcoming work with days that they are free to do the work so that the students don\'t overwork themselves and instead get their homework done when it needs to be done and then spacing out the upcoming projects on days that they are free. Overall, having extracurricular activities can help students expand on being more productive, being able to have good time management skills, and space things along with being able to maintain such things.\n \n The strengths and effects that can be created with the idea of students having to maintain and participate in extracurricular activitiesÂ are improving students mental health, students creating friendships with one-another, and lastly, the idea of students having to learn to balance extracurricular school activities with school work along with learning how to create more efficient time management skills and being more productive.Â',

Next, reason is students might not like the sports that are given to play, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not given that much attention to school, because they are so into the sport they are playing. So, i think students should have a choice to play a extracurricular sport.\n \n One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, that they don't have enough time to play a extracurricular activity. Students might have a job to do after school, like working, have to babysit there sister, and get somebody off the bus everyday, etc. Students don't have enough time to do an sport, and have responsibilities to do too. Therefore, Students have responsibilities to do that doesn't require doing an activity that can take time away from doing that.\n \n Next reason is students might not like the activity given to play. Someone might not appreciate or like the activity they have to play, because they don't know how to play or just to lazy to play it with others. Students nowadays like to choice what they want to play not what others want them to play; because they might not like the activity given to them. For example they might have got picked to play soccer, they never played soccer so they may not like to play; because they never played that exact activity. Therefore, they should play what they played or seen get played by them or others.\n \n Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school. They are so focused on that one activity that they forget about what is happening around them. Students give so much attention into something not that much important as school and there grades. There grades are dropping because they skip half of class just to do an activity, they never make it up because so into what happened during that activity time. Therefore, school should come first before any sport and everything else avoiding that school time.\n \n In conclusion, students should have a decision to what they want to do for there after schoolÂ activity. One reason is that students have responsibilities to do after school, for example chores, babysitting, and getting younger kids off the bus, etc. Another reason is students might not like that activity given to them, because they never played it before. Lastly, students are not paying enough attention in school, because they are so into that activity. To sum this up no i don't think every student should have to play an activity if they don't like or don't have enough time, or not paying attention in class.",

      essay:
        'Imagine every single student at your school is associated/participating in a sport, helping the yearbook committee, or even just serving on the student council because it could greatly impact the school by making it more organized and ""healthier"". Well thats exactly what my principle has decided to do. But not only can this change how there doing in school, it can also affect how they are struggling financially with all the fees they have to pay.\n \n Time plays an important role in this because a lot of students wont be able to fit an extra material into there daily schedules because there already jam packedÂ with other things they need to do throughout the day. This is also a little cruel for students because they would have to be occupied with numerous things at once and still remember to do other things. If the principles say that we must do an extracurricular activity, we wont have any time to do our own things. Students dont like to be stressed out and having to do lots of things at once. We already get tons of homework that some of us dont even finish because of the time we have isnt enough. So students might even stop turning in homework on time or even at all. Because focusing on other things has made it harder for them to keep up with school work. And then the student is blamed on for not doing it, but its not really there fault that they dont have enough time at home to finish everything. Students are getting the time taken away that they could use to do something that they enjoy like; spending time with there pets, relaxing, hanging out with friends etc. And that could affect how there school performance is going. Also they time they should be using as homework there turning in there free time because they dont have any other time for themselves.\n \n Money is also a problem in this situation because not everyone is going to have the necessary money needed to pay off the fees, or to get the materials needed for the activity they have chosen to do. But if the school offers to help pay the fees, then it would be a lot easier for those who need help financially. Im not saying they should pay the full price, but that they could help pay some of it, and the family getting helped does too;so that way they are both contributing. If money support isnt an option for them, then they just wont be able to participate and that should be blamed on the school not the family because its not their fault there struggling and cant afford to pay there children activities that the school says they ""must"" do. But whats the school going to do if they dont? suspend them? I think not.\n \n Most students wouldnt even want to participate in an extra curricular activity because they are already stressed out at home and have other things to deal with. Maybe the student is going through a rough time and doesnt want to be pressured into doing something extra thats just going to worsen there problem. So they shouldnt be forced to do something they dont want.\n \n Overall the schools shouldnt be doing this because its just a waste of time, money, and academic time. students already have a handful of things they need to keep up with for example: homework, they usually get it everyday with every class; that is already stressful enough. Religious activities like attending church or going to mutual, babysitting for friends or family, or even just spending time with friends,family and even pets. But with the school making us do other extracurricular activities, we wont have time do to what we enjoy and make us happy.Â',

        "I agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, no matter who they are. An extracurricular activity is an activity that enhances the knowledge of a particular subject. It goes beyond the standard curriculum that is taught in classes at school. This activity could be formal like an honors society, math league, or engineering program, or you could take a more active route and play football, track, or swim. The list could go on and on, ensuring that students can find an activity they're interested in participating in.\n \n Participating in at least one extracurricular could give you greater opportunities for the future. It could help you manifest your desired college. Colleges really like when a student is involved with an extracurricular and it makes sense why. It shows that you are willing to go deeper in your learning of a subject. This drive to push yourself can also reflect in your work ethic, benefiting your grades and mindset. If this behavior continues, it could help you in the future with any job you have and even get you, or help you find, your dream career.\n \n An extracurricular provides a fun environment. If you are truly doing what you are interested in, it should be enjoyable. They are also a great way to socialize and get out of the house. You can meet many new and great friends along the way. An Extracurricular can create a safe environment for students. Students feel like they belong somewhere and can be themselves alongside others that share the same passion as them.\n \n I positively agree that a student should be in at least one extracurricular. They don't even have to take up that much time. There are an amazing amount of opportunities and benefits that come from them that shouldn't be passed. It could just be something to do after school, or it could be what you love to do. An extracurricular is great for everybody.",

It shouldn't be up to the principal if they want to participate in them or not.\n \n There is just some people that can't participate in things like sports , if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then.

There is some people that barely get to spend time with their family because they're so busy so they don't have time for activitys.\n \n With sports being a extracurricular activity there is some people that can't afford is because it can be exspincve and some kids/families don't have the money for that. Theres some kids that would love to do things like sports , but don't have transpartion or money and some schools don't always have rides for students to get back and forth.\n \n Some students can't participate in things like that because they get in to much trouble *they only do it like that at some schools*\n \n I don't really see a point of having to do a extracrricular activity theres just no point. I don't think trying it once would hurt to see if you like it or not! If our principal made us do this i feel like it should be once a mouth because other people have other things to do and are busy , and i feel like the students should be able to pick what activity they want to do or not. And the teachers should put it in as a grade if they participate or not.\n \n End of teh story , i think theres no point in extracurricular activitys.",

        "I was in the hallways looking for an after school activity I couldn't find one that I liked or seemed interesting. The principal made it so that everyone has to do an extracurricular activity after school. I disagree with this decision.\n \n I disagree with this decicion because some people just don't get along with others and those activities require them to talk to people they may not like. Some people are shy and get nervous talking to people. Others are rude and don't like people in general, and people don't want to talk to them. Some people just can't make friends because they're funny looking. People like those anime kids probably can't make friends either because they stay hissing at people and having crushes on cartoon charaters. People can be depressed and not want to do anything after school just go home and lay in their bed the rest of the day.\n \n If someone has do to a sport because there is no other activities to do them they won't enjoy what they're doing. Even if they end up liking it they are doing it for fun not because they want to win everygame. Also is it's a sport you are making thwem spent their money on something you forced them to do. They could have used that money for something that they actually need like food or for paying their bills but no you want them to pay for a jersey, shoes, special socks and they didn't even want to do the sport in the first place. Their family could be really struggling to pay the rent and you want them to give you $100 for a jersey.\n \n Some people might not even enjoy being out doors or they might not be in the mood to be doing stuff like that they just want to go home to their dog or to their nice and comfertable bed but no you want them to spend more energy on after school stuff and teachers already complain about how some kids never do their work and thye dotn care what the excuse is. Someone could say \"\"Sorry I couldn't do my homework my grandpa died yesterday\"\" and the teacher would say \"\"that's tough you should have done before he died you had time then didn't you\"\" and with everyone doing after school activities there is no time for homework because you get home around six or seven then you eat because you must be starving then you take a shower and boom it's time to sleep and you got no homework done.\n \n I disagree with the decision to make everyone have an after school activity becuase not everyone has time or the personality to be hanging out with random people everyday after school. Some people might be depressed and others can't make friends. Not everyone has the money for supplies they need for their activity. That's why not everybody should be in an extracurricular activity.",

        "Did you ever have an extracurricular activity or also known as an after school activity in school? Some students after school participate in clubs or sports like the year book, student council, or football. Now some schools they may require you to participate in an after school activity, and others may not. Personally i am against it because many students work after school, many students have no interest in any, and many students who dont want to be there will be a distraction to those who do want to be there.\n \n First there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. If they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. They may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. If you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.\n \n Secondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. Maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. Now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. If they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.\n \n Lastly it could cause stress. School puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. Have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. Some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. Some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.\n \n In conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. Now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. Its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.",

Extracurricular activities will help make friends that have the same interests as you and thats one of the reasons i like them.\n \n You can join a club that is fun and you can get some school help from it as well. It can help you pass a class if you need some extra help in it. It can also be really fun like sports then you probably think they are fun and sometimes you can learn something from that sport. You can do their things like Lego club, reading club, and ext. E\n \n xtracuticular activities will help make friends and thats one of the reasons i like them.\n \n I think that having extracurricular clubs is good and i think that all schools should have it . It is good because most of the time kids get to choose their own club, they can make new friends, and they can be fun and they may help you out with school. I think that they willÂ help kids because kids will be lying around in their house doing nothing after school but when they work it can get there brains going. Â Â Â",

        "The principal just announced a new school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate in at least on after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims.\n \n First of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off.\n \n In this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great.\n \n Going off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere!\n \n In conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people.Â",

      essay:
        "You have so much to do! You have a pile of homework, youth group, errands, and, on top of that, you have to meet with a club that you don't want to be in. If you force someone to do things that they don't want to do, there can be a lot of negative effects. As a result, I don't think that participating in an extracurricular should be required because people who are forced to join something will probably not participate well, could get very stressed and overwhelmed with the extra load, and people who are not already in a club have multiple reasons to not join.\n \n First off, if you aren't able to find an extracurricular that you like, you could be forced to join one. Then, if you're forced to join a club that you do not like, that could hinder the group's progress and work. For example, if someone who doesn't know how to play lacrosse joins the lacrosse team, some people would be angry. Especially if the new person doesn't want to play and doesn't know how. They are most likely diving headfirst into the sport without learning the rules. That means they wouldn't know how to check correctly, wouldn't know defense or attack, and wouldn't know the rules for scoring. On top of that, them not wanting to do lacrosse would ruin the team dynamic. We had a player one year who did not want to play on the defense, so she played the position as bad as she could, making the people who were trying to play well angry, and ruining our teamwork. So, if people don't want to participate in a club or sport, they might ruin it for everyone else, and that wouldn't be beneficial.\n \n Next, having an extracurricular on top of everything that you already have to do, like homework or family, could make you stressed and exhausted. I know for me that having lacrosse practice, Odyssey of the Mind, and homework every single day makes me exhausted. I enjoy playing lacrosse, and I enjoy OM, but when I get home from lacrosse after an hour and a half, and having done OM before that, I have exceeded my limits of activity for the day. All that I want to do is take a shower and go to sleep. If I have to do my homework and spend more time working, I will most likely be very tired the next day. With that, other people might have little siblings that they have to take care of, and being in a club, going home and doing their homework, and after that, taking care of siblings, will give them a lot of stress to do everything fast, making them rush their homework to make sure that their sibling are cared for, or neglecting their siblings to do their homework well. Juggling multiple responsibilities can impact stress levels, productivity, and time management.\n \n Finally, people who are not in a club can have multiple reasons not to be in a club. You could choose not to be in a club because your parents can't pick you up afterwards, you have too much homework every night, you have siblings to take care of, etcetera. People who aren't participating in any extracurriculars just might not want the responisibility of remembering. Everyone has a reason, even if it's that it doesn't sound interesting.\n \n Joining an extracurricular should not be forced onto students. I think that if you force someone to do anything that they do not want to, they will not participate and that will come back around to you in negative ways.",

        "If my principle were to require every student to participate in an extra curricular activity, I would disagree. I choose to disagree because, some students might not have the time, parents or adults at home cant take or pick them up, money problems, students are needed at home and, they should be able to have the choice to participate in an extracurricular activity or not. I feel it is unfair to force all students to participate in an activity.\n \n Many students might not have the time to do an extracurricular activity. They could have a lot of homework they must do or, they could be busy doing other things. Parents might also not have the time to bring their kids to the activities and pick them up as well. Many parents work and they might even work until late. How would they be able to transport their kids to and from their activities? From my expirience, my parents are both really busy. My dad goes to work from early in the morning and doesn't get home until about 7PM. He's busy all day. Therefore, he wouldn't be able to to get my siblings or I from our activities. My mom also helps my dad at work, they're both really busy. She has to take my brother and I to our practices everyday then, pick us up. I myself am a busy person. I have practice 5 times a week and they're back to back. Sometimes I have to wait hours to eat and most nights I don't have enough time to do my homework. I go to sleep late and do it all over again the next day. You can't buy time or make it go by slower to get to and from those activities. It all doesn't fit into some peoples scheduals.\n \n Forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity isn't fair for a lot of reasons. Some students might not be interested in sports. Some might not be interested in being on the school council. Some might not be interested in working on the yearbook. Some just might not be interested in any of the activities that are provided. Everyone has different things they like or enjoy doing. Forcing students to do something they don't like, makes them feel uncomfortable or out of place, it isn't fair. It makes them miserable. Schools focus on including everyone but sometimes they don't include how a student feels.\n \n Money is also an issue. I know for a fact that participating in a sport isn't free. Nothing in this world is ever really free. We never know about a familys money situation but, it's important to keep in mind that some people struggle and that includes even providing food for their family. On top of that housing bills, other bills, insurance, taxes and savings is already a hassle for a family who is struggling. Adding activities that require a payment for an activity that a kid is forced to do is even more unfair and more trouble. It adds too much stress.\n \n In conclusion, forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity could be an inconvienance as well as unfair. Not a lot of good things come out of a situation like this. The negatives cancel out the positive.Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Everyone needs a break from something they tend to stress about so they can get there stuff together. Meaning, if you keep pushing yourself to do something your having a hard time on you should take a break and do something you that will calm you down to help you. My principal says that students should attend any type of extracurricular avtivities. Such as art, sports, yearbook, and many more. I agree with my principal with his thought of choice.\n \n Having fun classes can really help student when they start having a ruff time in school. Class is really stressful for me and others when they don't understand something at school. My happiness is soccer, art, and writing. Those 3 things help me so much. So when i'm strugling the only thing I think about is doing something I know that will keep my mind off of it and will start to calm me down. Art is one of the best class anyone can take. I say this because art, is litearlly art. You can do art out of anger, stress, sadness, and even happiness. Litearally out of anything. If your planning on doing a new sport in high school it can build your stress to even it to be better. I would have to wait all the way until i get home to play soccer, but in high school you will have a period so you can do that sport or activity. You should'nt be forced to keep doing your work without a break from being overwhelmed.\n \n The more you practice the better you get. I understand when people say the more you study in school the more you understand. Thats not just for school work. It's also for these fun activities. Say you have never done a sport before, but want to start. You can do that in school and then when you sign up for the sport you want to do you will already be really really good, because all the practice you have got. Also, most people in middle school want to do a sport in high school. If you participate in that specific sport the coaches will see that you are really intrested in doing it. You can even do soemthing you never thought you would do, like Yearbok. Yearbok is a fun activityt and you can do a lot. The more you do it the best you get. That can be you new enjoyable hobby. No one ever knows what you can't do.\n \n Although, students being allowed to do a fun class during learning hours can get them to lose the thought of there work. Students should focus on school work and schol work only. Especially for those who want a good career in the future. You can actually make a lot of money from art. Art is a easy activity you can do for your whole life, and it will also lead you to big things. The most important thing in my opinion is to do something that will get you somewhere ahead of life. Doing that will help you sucseed within your future. Anyting you enjoy doing as an activity can get you somehwere.\n \n Extracurricular activities should be a new thing students at Hayfield should attend, and many more schools. I think that is a really good idea to allow for us students. No one should be stressed about someting that they need in life, what do you think?",

        "Nearly over 78% of students participate in after school or extracurricular activities in the US as of today.\n \n While it is important for a young adolescent to become involved in some form of an extracurricular, to make something of the such mandatory is unneeded and inconvenientÂ for many. Taking part in a extra activities requires many resources which some people can't afford or simply don't have. For a student to become apart of something, it should be at their own free will and not because someone of higher status makes it not optional. With forcing these students into all of these different subjects and areas it can create issues with money for low income families, time consumption, student transportation, and student's overall mental health and happiness.\n \n With families who struggled with income or have budgetary issues, this new rules could be extremely challenging. For those who are on the free or reduced lunch plan, it's even more likely that they wont be able to place their child into an extracurricular due to costs. Activities such as sports, dance, theater, and clubs cost money, something many don't have much of. Whether it's to simply enroll your child in the sport, to pay for dance shoes, or to buy supplies it always comes down to some sort of price. Even if a family is not struggling with funding, many see it as unnecessaryÂ to spend money on something their child truly doesn't wish to participate in.\n \n It isn't uncommon for students who live in larger families with younger siblings to watch after the younger children. Many students who are apart of extracurricular often don't have this job nor need to be home earlier due to this reason. When students are forced to spend their free time at a practice or rehearsal, this creates conflict within the household dynamic. Without the children there to watch after their younger siblings or to perform everyday chores such as cleaning up after the house or tending to a farm if the student were to live in the more rural areas, it causes the family to have to search for daycare or hire an extra hand which is not only costly but also stressful.\n \n Not only is it time that is an issue, but transportation is also a main concern. Many parents or legal guardians travel and work for several hours, often getting home late. If children are at extracurricular while their parents work, this means there is no one who is available to pick them up or provide transportation to such activity or back home. While carpooling or busing may be an option in specific areas, this does not apply to students who do not have access to said buses or who live in extremely rural areas, further from the school or activity site.\n \n Joining an outside group or involving yourself in a social setting where one participates in a hobby may be healthy and is encouraged, but just because it is pushed for does not mean it should be mandatory. The decision to devote ones time, money, and effort to such a consuming thing should be a personal and willing choice. Forcing a student to become apart of the student counsel or to play a sport may seem like the healthy option and makes them involved in something, but sometimes this can be damaging to a student. If the child is unhappy with what they've been put into, and are forced to participate in this activity several times a week, it's bound to create some form of an issue with the student over time. It can cause depression or irritation, with one being forced into something that doesn't truly bring them joy which may both effect the students personal life and scholastic performance.\n \n Becoming apart of an extracurricular activity should be a free willing, and personal choice that fits for both students and their families. This should revolve around the students wishes and not those of someone who does not know each child's personal situation. Forcing one into something they did not choose for themselves has very few positive effects and is bound to do more harm than good for each individual and their families. Enlisting each and every child into activities outside of school causes too many conflicts with time, money, transportation, and a student's overall well being. Although it's encouraged to participate in an extracurricular, it should not be made mandatory for students.",

        "When going into middle school and high school, most students have the opportunity to pick extra curricular activitiesÂ such as sports, art, student council, and much more. These activitiesÂ give them a chance to incorporate their interested into their schedules. These classes are also often beneficial to the teenage mind while they are trying to grow and explore themselves. However, should extracurricular activities should be required? Without extra curricular activities, it is harder for teens to have the opportunity to be apart of their community. They also help teens branch out, be creative, and make new friends. Extracurricular activities gives students more independence and freedom to structure their own schedules, which can get pretty busy and full of school work! Some teens, however, don't see the benefit of extracurricular activities during middle school or high school and still need a little push to get involved. Students should be required to take an extracurricular activities because, it forces them to be an active citizen who is part of the community, it gives them anÂ opportunityÂ to takeÂ theirÂ mindÂ off of school, and it pushes them to go out of their comfort zone and try something new.\n \n Requiring teens to take an extra curricula activity will help them become more involved in their school and local community, which is an important part of their lives. The average school community is made mostly of the student, so their involvement in the school is vital, even more so then the teachers. Not only does extracurricular activities help in school involvement, but it gets teens a head start to be involved in their local communities too. For example, some high school cheer leadingÂ teams not only cheer at school sports events, but cheer at town or county events. Also, lots of school art classes have their students work displayed at local shows or even just around the school building. In addition to that, lots of musicalÂ groups preform at school concerts and go to state competitions. These are only a few of the options, but almost all extracurricular activities work to get their students involved in the community. By enforcing extracurricular activities you enforce an involved lifestyle at a young age which is a skill teens can carry with them for the rest of their lives.\n \n Not only do extracurricularÂ activities make students lives part of the community, but takes their minds of of their stressful school life. After a long day in school students are often forced to go home and do even more school work. Teens minds are consistently on school, grades, tests, and homework. School can create an unhealthy amount of stress, especial for teens who are still growing up. It is also easy to get sucked into over working and over worrying about grades and a good GPA. Having extracurricular activities normally gives them at least an hour of time to de-stress themselves every day. Not only do they get this time to distress, but also to put their energy into something they love! It is a huge change from sitting in a classroom trying to pay attention all day. Student need this time and this outlet do things that make them happy. Requiring extracurricular activitiesÂ will give all student the chance to de-stress and take their minds off school work, especially when it becomes unhealthily over whelming.\n \n Lastly, requiring teenagers to branch out and try something new threw extracurricular activities can introduce them to new opportunities and teach them a valuable life lesson. Teens often fear trying something new or coming out of their shells. These fear often come from the fear of not being accepted or the fear of failure. Unfortunately,Â while trying to figure out how to fit in, teens can take the wrong path and become a bully or put themselves in danger. Extracurricular activities teaches them how to try new thing in a safe way. Breaking the ice between groups of people can be very hard and is something that most teens fear they will fail at, but it becomes a lot easier when they all share common hobbies. Extracurricular groups are like built in friends, or at least a group of people that have shared interests. Learning how to try newÂ things, even tough it might seem scary is an important lesson that will helps teens for the rest of their lives. In conclusion, extra curricular activities will teach teens how to branch out and try new things, a skill that they will use even in adulthood.\n \n Teaching teens how to become part of their community, take their mind off of school, and try new things, are all benefits to requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities force kids to not only be involvedÂ at school, but locally in their town and city. They also let kids have a built in break from the stress that school brings. Finally, they teach kids the valuable life lesson ofÂ trying new things. Most teens are just trying to figure out who they are before beingÂ thrown into the life of adult hood. For many, however, they don't want to identify as the average teen who sits in a classroom all day. It is important to give students things like extracurricular activities so they can celebrate what makes them unique. Extracurricular activitiesÂ aren't just a club or a group of people, it is an outlet to be yourself.Â",

        '""Ughhhh,"" said Generic_Name, ""I am so bored, I wish I can do something fun right now!"" Generic_Name complained. Generic_Name had just gotten home from school and has nothing to do. Generic_Name goes downstairs and asks his mom about what activities are available for him to participate in. ""Mom! I want to participate in a school activity! What should I do?"" Generic_Name questioned, ""well honey, there is always an activity group you can join at school,"" Generic_Name\'s Mom replied. ""I feel so lonely, maybe I can meet new people if I join a club or sport, dont you think so Mom?"" Generic_Name said, ""I would like to join our school soccer team, I think that I would also meet new people there,"" Generic_Name said, ""sure honey, I think thats the best idea ever!"" Generic_Name\'s Mom encouraged. Students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.\n \n First, students would gain confidence in themselves. According to research, most students that participate in at leastÂ one school activity tend to be more self confident. For instance, my best friend, Generic_Name, that used to be my neighbor when I lived in Virginia, was very insecure about himself, and after he decided to join a school activity, he became very secure and confident about himself. Also, students that are self-confident tend to succeed more in life than those who are not. For example, Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft was very confident in himself, and that eventually led him to become one of the richest people living on planet Earth. Some may think that they do not need self confidence, but research says that everyone will eventually become miserable if not self-confident.\n \n Second, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities. According to this, the explanation is that students can easily find what they are interested in for future purposes. For example, in the 1900s, my old math teacher, Generic_Name, did not like the subject math at all, and once he joined an after school math club, he began to love math, and this is the reason of him becomingÂ a math teacher. Also, such a small addition to your life can help you be a more organized person, and being organized will get you many opportunities in life. For instance, My friend, Generic_Name, was very disorganized and could not get a job, and once he learned to be organized, he got many high paying job offers. According to research, some may be satisfied with themselves being disorganized, but almost all become regretful of the act of not being organized during their life.\n \n Third, students would not spend time alone. This means that students are not going to be alone, wasting their priceless time. For example, almost any elder you ask, will inform you that they wasted much of their time being alone from experience. Additionally, based off research, most people that spend time alone, usually are depressed and have a sad, gloomy personality. For instance, my old friend from Maryland, and was only 17, was a very depressed person after he stopped attending his high-school after school activities during 2012. Some groups may occupy a very depressing, and not attracting personality from genetics and think that it is permanent, but research informs that even such little additions to your life like school activities can greatly change that.\n \n Imagine, you have just made your high-school soccer team. You come home, and open your ajar door to your well organized room that has a very welcoming smell. You have many good friends from your amusing and attracting personality, and always have something fun to do. Your a great, wise person that everyone looks up to and you have a very open mind. You are getting offers for scholarships and many other mouth-watering opportunities. Overall, your life is great from such a little addition to it. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because students would gain confidence in themselves, students would expand themselves to many possible opportunities, and students would not spend time alone.',

        "Should the principal be allowed to force decisions on their students? While this may lead to some poor decisions, it would be better in the long run. \"\"Why?\"\" you say, you see 70% of kids don't do social or physical activities of any kind, and suffer as a result. There are also a lot of times where kid's are forced to do something new and then end up liking it. Something they never would have done they liked. Along with that, putting kid's through these programs could also give them valuable life skills. Overall, I do think that the principal, or whoever is managing the school, should be allowed to force these programs upon kids.\n \n My first point I'm going to list is that it get's them doing something. Like I said a lot of kids don't do anything by themselves, and around 2/3 of them have less than three friends. There is a whole outside world waiting for them. It is also noted that these kids more often than not have great talents, which are just waiting to shine. With a stronger school, getting them to go outside, and participate in activities such as clubs, school teams, and the student council would be easy and beneficial, and some of these benefits would be stronger and smarter kids, and more school funding for these programs.\n \n The second reason I think this should be done, is because of practical reasons. The goal of the school is to cram as much as they can into the student before the year's end. They could also set up after school activities straight after school to do this even better, along with this would help students who don't have parents or guardians at home. Whether this would be mandatory or not is one sided, it must be mandatory. Another practical reasons this should be done is that it would allow more time for the teacher and student to interact helping with the normal school day and settling any problems.\n \n One thing other people might say is that it would increase costs, and that the school shouldn't be messing with the student's childhood. Both of those accusations are wrong. Doing these has been shown in several studies to not be very expensive, and is literally just a step up from end of day clubs. The second point isn't true either, the school is a part of the student's childhood, and they should be embracing it. Younger generations haven't learned what and what not to do yet, and the school can help them decide.\n \n In the end, I do think that the principal should be able to force activities like these upon the students, to improve their live skills, and maybe provide a bit of fun. Of course, the United States is a republic, so it all depends on the parent's, but I do think they will agree with what I say, that children shouldn't be sitting in their bed all lazy, but be making important life choices.\n \n Now what do I think you think of this? Even if you are just a student, and not a parent of teacher who already knows all the benefits, it is for your personal future, and it will be better for you. Tell other people about this idea, and eventually it will be national education.",

        "The principle has decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I don't agree because, we already have enough to do at school. We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to. We already hate being in school.\n \n The first reason why is. We already have enough to do at school is because, we have to do 5 SOLS, 2 for English, 1 for math, 1 for civics and economics, and 1 for science. We already have to have 4 blocks a day. We just don't need anymore classes.\n \n The second reason is. We don't need to stay in school longer than we have to because, we already spend around 7 hours in school. Our second block is way to long. We don't have enough time to get to our next class when we have A lunch because the main set of stairs is blocked off.\n \n The last reason is. We already hate being in this school because, one of the light protectors in the gym is hanging down. The school pizza hasÂ a lotÂ of grease on it. There is a fight happening almost everyday.\n \n These are the reasons why the principle should not add an extracurricular activity.",

        'Generic_Name closes his eyes as the teacher thunders her way towards him. She finally arrivesÂ with a hungry smile and cruel eyes and says,""Generic_Name did you do your homework?"".""No i did not teacher because I had no time due to the outrageous rule that the principal made that made it mandatory that all students participate in one extracurricular activity."" Her eyes gleamed with anticipation as she gave Generic_Name an F and walked off to seek her next victim. The rule that dictates that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity is a mutiny and should be abolished at once because,students can use the extra time for more beneficial uses such as doing their homework or catching up on some sleep,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will notÂ benefit them.\n \n The first reason why the rule that states that you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be nullified is,that students can use the extra time for more productive purposes such as doing homework or catching up on some sleep. When i was younger I used to participate in writing club and when I would come back home I would be drained. I would have no energy to do anything so the majority of the time my assignments went incomplete and turned into zeros. One day the teachers started noticing the lack of turned in assignments and called my parents for a parent teacher conference. the teachers brought me and my parents to a table wearing serious expressions. The teacher said,""Your son has displayed superior thinking skills but the lack of turned in assignments astounds us."" My parents replied by saying,""Our son gets back everyday from writing club extremely tired and does not have the time or energy to do his homework."" they came to a conclusion to cancel writing club for me and then I started turning in my homework on time. 44 percent of homework is not completed due to lack of time. If you say that they can do their homework when they get home after the extracurricularÂ activity I would say that kids are not fully developed adults yet and dont have as much energy or stamina and cannot function after long periods of time.\n \n The second reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activity should be abolished is,that schools do not specialize in what club or sport that they offer and they will not teach it as well as the facilities that specialize in what they are offering. Its not the schools job to provide extra clubs they can offer clubs but they should not be able to force you to join a club. If a child wants to play a sport or endorse an activity, he can go to an outdoor club or facilityÂ that specializes in what the child wants to do. When i was eleven years old,I played on my school soccer team. The coach did not know how to play soccer and I hated it. I never got any better and I almost quit soccer then and there,but I went home one night and told my mom about it. She said,""You should try UCLA Soccer I read about it it\'s very interesting"". I tried it out the very following week it was amazing,I loved it and,I have been playing soccer ever since. If you say that the school clubs can also be good at teaching what they do I would tell you that a school club will never be as good at teaching a sport or activity than an actual facility that specializes at the given sport or activity.\n \n The third and final reason that the rule that states you must participate in an extracurricular activities must be abolished is,that if you force the kids to choose from a limited set of sports and clubs they might not like any of the activities that you are offering and because of that they will never practice what they are being taught and will never get better at what they are being taught. If a person does not like what they are being taught 98 percent of the people will not practice the subject or sport they do not like. If you dont practice what you are being taught you will never get better at what you are practicing and will never succeed at it. My cousin used to play karate and he hated it he would always pass the tests but he would never practice and as a black belt some of the blue belts that practiced were stronger than him. One day his mom asked him""Why arent you as good as some of the other students""? He replied by saying,""I dont enjoy karate like I used to and as a result,I don\'t practice anymore"".\n \n If you say that people at school can like the subject or sport they are being taught I would say that is the reason extracurricular activities should be offered but not forced.\n \n Generic_Name smiles at the teacher as she comes by ""Do you have your homework she asks""?""Yes ma am.""he replies with a grin. Ever since the rule that made extracurricular activities mandatory got abolished he has had time to finish all of his assignments and still had a little time for relaxation. I disagree with the principal\'s rule that every student has to participate in an extracurricular activity because students can use the time for more beneficial purposes,The school cannot teach what sport or club that they are offering better than a facility that specializes in what they are offering, Finally,kids will not develop a skill that they are not interested in and it will not be beneficial to force a kid to go do an activity that will notÂ benefit them.',

        "Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so why not satiate all three by participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wideÂ joy by solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!\n \n Firstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved by participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached by all participants makes the friend-finding process much more simple. ExracurricularsÂ alsoÂ provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel they don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel they do.Â Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability by building support systems has never been more important.\n \n Next, parents may find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school may not have to do that anymore, at least for a day or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new foundÂ friends to get home.\n \n Finally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!\n \n In SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.\n \n Extracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires joy in people is always a good option. Starting with extracurricular activities is a great option!",

Participating on one activity can also be entertainment , but some student thinks one activity is not enough for them. In my opinion, participating in one extracurricular activity is termenously and entertainment for students.\n \n Frist, participating in one extracurriclar activity can help students on their others subjects or doing their other school work. For example, if students particpates in more than one activity they can not focus on their other subject like math, doing thier homeworks and studing for thier tests. In addtion for students to focus or particpate on thier other subject is better for them to participate in one activity.\n \n Next, particpateing in one activity have a great impact on students. For example they can lrean new things and they can see how much distinguished are they on that activity. All activity are not easy some are diffcult and some of them are easy but we have to try our best.\n \n Furthermore, students should particpate in one extracurriclar activity because they can complete their work on time.

        "Extracurricular activities are very important in a students life. They develop communication skills, social skills, and among others, your ability to work well with other people. On the other hand, they should not be required for all students to participate in. Although all students could possibly find something they're interested in when it comes to after school activities, such as clubs or sports, not all students are capable of handling the responsibilities that come along with an extracurricular activity. Have you ever come to the conclusion that not every student can even maintain good grades at school? For some children, it's harder to balance school work and their everyday life alone, but if you add an extracurricular activity to their plate of responsibilities, it may be too much for them to handle. For a principal to make extracurricular activities a necessity at school, is not very considerate. As an adult you must realize that not every person, let alone children, can handle the same work load as others can.\n \n Even though research has shown that extracurricular activities can be very beneficial for people, as it pertains to their physical, and mental well-being, it can also be damaging if too much work is placed upon one person alone. Stress is a very common factor in a child's life, and the majority of it is from life at home, and the excessive amount of work received at school. But in comparison, some kids can handle the load, and like the responsibility given to them. Not all children are like that though, and that is what the principal fails to realize. Although the principal may not have come to light about the amount of stress that could potentially be put on the students, the gesture to make the activities a necessity was most likely at their best interest at heart.\n \n For the kids that work well under pressure, or have the capability to handle the challenges they face, the change in the schools priorities for the students probably won't affect them as much. Although only one extracurricular activity would be required, not all students could be able to wisely manage their time to fit the activity in their schedule. Also, maybe not all students would be able to find something they enjoy with the options given at their school. If someone were to make it a priority for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would be extremely recommended for the person to make the activity choices an exceptionally wide variety, so that it is more likely for students to find the things they enjoy to do. With the exception of making sure that there would be an activity to match each students interest, the idea would not be too bad. But in the same breath, that'd require some type of survey or application of some type, that every student must take in order to find out their interests, so that way making the activities wont be as difficult. Although keep in mind, that not every student may want to participate regardless of whether or not there is an activity they might enjoy.\n \n There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouseÂ some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, \"\"average\"\" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand. But the idea as a whole would potentially cause a lot of stress to the principal, considering that not every child will have the same perspective on the idea, nor will their parents.\n \n Yes, the motion being taken will have several benefits, and several stressful altercations, but at the end of the day everyone is different, and not everyone is going to have the same opinion when it comes to this situation. Even though the principal is only asking each student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it still may be too much to ask of some kids, considering their life outside of school, and what they find important in their lives as far as activities go. But maybe enforcing this act could open not only the students' eyes, but the parents as well, that trying new things isn't always such a bad idea, sometimes we just need a little push to get us started. But despite all the possible benefits of the idea, it still probably shouldn't necessarily be a requirement for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know how much stress someone deals with just by handling their personal life, one activity may not seem like much to you, but for some people one activity could be a handful. Forcing the students to participate in activities that they may not like, could possibly lead to a decrease in social skills, instead of an increase. Â Â Â Â",

        "Every school contains extracurricular activities, from sports to clubs to the student council. These after school activities were created to entertain those students who wanted to learn or have fun with others while in a safe and comfortable environment. Although most schools don't force participation, it would be extremely beneficial if they did as extracurricular activities teach how to cooperate with others, allow students to explore things out of their comfort zone and meet new people and shows the crucial importance of time management.\n \n Learning teamwork and cooperation with your peers is an important thing to learn all throughout middle and high school. Being on a sports team or in a competitive club can show students how to work with each other and communicate accordingly. For instance, when on a sports team like volleyball, teamwork is essential. Each member plays an important role but that role cannot be correctly executed unless the other members are assisting. The hitter depends on the setter to give a sturdyÂ and high set in order to spike the ball and score a point, and the setter relies on the defensive line to give a high and straight pass in order to provide a good set. Communication and cooperation with one another is vital and can overall teach the players many lessons and prepare them for the future.\n \n Furthermore, extracurricular activities can also allow students to get out of their comfort zone to learn new things and meet new people. Schools contain numerous different clubs, one for each different crowd a student might fall into. There might be a club for music, books, movies, the environment, writing, or science and math, etc. Making sure students must participate in one of these clubs or activities can give them the push they need to realize a hobby they might not have known they had or meet a new friend they would have never talked to outside of the club. When I was new to my school, I didn't know anyone to well but once I joined cooking club, I learned many new things while participating and met brand new students too.\n \n Although some might argue that they might not have time for this after schoolÂ activity because of homework or chores, this decision made by the school can give students the chance to work on their time management. Time management is one skill that is very hard to achieve but is used almost all throughout your life. Managing school work, with the extracurricular activity, and whatever else they might have at home can allow students to work on this skill and apply it to real life.\n \n The decision stating that all students must participate in extracurricular activities can overall help them when it comes to their future. Giving these students the opportunity to socialize with peers and enjoy themselves can benefit them in too many ways to count, educating them and further preparing them for what's to come after high school and even after college as well. The countless different clubs and teams can allows them to learn to cooperate with others, learn and meet new people and practice their time management skills.Â  Â Â Â Â",

I think this is a good idea or way for kids to express themselves. Here are some reasons why I agree with being apart of the activities.\n \n One thing you can do is work on the yearbook. You can also open up and help motivate others. Participating in something helps with many skills such as, communication and working with others. The yearbook could even have anonymous writers, if you want to say something and don't want everyone knowing who said it. Also taking photos of other activities around the school would even be great.\n \n Another extracurricular activity you could do is serving as student council. If you want to see changes in somethings you can step up and work as a council to make a difference. You could also get groups to hang up motivational quotes around the school. Sometimes, even having funds to raise money for the school would be a helpful idea.\n \n You can also play sports to participate in an activity. Playing sports gives you the time for you make new friends, do what you love, and even hang with your bestie. Finding a sport you like can be hard but giving it your all is the best you can do. You can even get scholarships to colleges. And being on a team is your best suport group, they are always there when you need them.\n \n In conclusion, I agree we should be in extracurricular activities.

        "Being a teenager can be one of the best times of your life. As a teenager, I myself have participated in many sports activities and extracurricular activities in my free time. Although I am lucky enough to have experienced being in a club and on a sports team, other students may not have that opportunity.\n \n I believe that schools should require extracurricular activities, one of the reasons being kids social skills. Being put into different clubs or sports teams can help teens make new friends and provide a larger circle of students they can interact with on a daily basis. Being in those activities can provide new experiences those kids never thought to try. This can spark new interests and lead to students doing bigger and better things in their lives, and also help them with choosing a career path.\n \n This generation of teenagers has become addicted to technology and social media. Kids ranging from high school all the way down to preschool use technology on a daily basis. If schools require students to participate in an extracurricular activity, It will pull students away from social media and lead to a more productive way in them spending their time. Too much screen time can take a toll on young people's mental health and I believe that in having required activities, kids of all ages can focus on sports rather than their social media status.\n \n If school were to make extracurricular activities required, they would probably have to provide them for free. Schools can't force the parents to pay for extra activities, nor can some parents afford to pay for those activities. If the school covered the cost of everything the school would get more respect, because it would be showing they didn't just care about grades and they care about your mental health as well. If extracurricular were required it would be good for the school to get to fill up their clubs. For example, they could have more students in the yearbook club, which would improve the quality of the work they put into the yearbook.\n \n In the end I believe that having required extracurricular activities would reallyÂ make the school environment a happy and healthier place for students, teachers, and parents.Â",

In my opinion ,I strongly disagree with the principals decision and I think students should have the option and freedom to choose whether they want to participate in school activities or not. So today I'm here to explain why this is a bad idea and hope you will agee with me as well.\n \n First of all,most students after school are busy, at least I know I am. When I'm done with school and go home I immediately get ready to go to the gym with my mom, I go to the gym at least 2 hours ,after that I go do my homework ,then prepare for my piano lessons at the community center ,and now adding an activity I'm forced to do my schedule gets pretty tight . Thats also a main reason why students dont go to school activities, they simply don't have enough time. But after the principals decision , students have to re-organize their schedules making them have less time to do the things they really want to do.\n \n Secondly , what if students don't like the activity they are forced to do. Yes, I know they are plenty of choices to choose from , but theres a chance students won't like any of them. It will make them feel pressured, stressful, and notÂ joyful about going there. The student may also rebel , leading to them acting bad around the students and making the activity simply unpleasant.\n \n Lastly , this school activities makes it feel like an extra hour of school. We already have enough homework and stress coming at us, so why should we get more? I get that the school is trying to make us be productive and help our school in a fun way with our friends , but whats the fun if we are getting forced to do them, also when students are getting forced to do an school activity it makes students feel like they have to do an extra class that doesn't even help our grades , nor does it count as a grade.\n \n In conclusion, this are some of the reasons I disagree with the principals decisions. I hope this could change your and the principals mind and take in considerate on students opinions as well.\n \n Students should choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and not be forced to.

Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.\n \n Seven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule.

While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.\n \n Plenty of studies have shown that this past generation of students have the the largest amount of stress scientist have seen in years. Whether that stress comes from bullying, home life, school work, mental health, or high expectations, stress is unsettling high in students of all ages. Middle school student worry about the transition to high school, and high schoolÂ studentsÂ worry about their transition to college. All students worry, even if those worries are irrational, they are still stressed. That is why adding an extracurricular could be too much to ask of students.\n \n Overall, extracurricular activitiesÂ being mandatory sounds wonderful and has many pros as well, but when people look closer they realize that it would end up as a train wreck. ExtracurricularÂ activities should stay optional for those students who have the time and the energy to do their absolute best.",

        "How many of us students want to be forced to do something? Probably not many. But, if it is for a good outcome, then maybe we should take into consideration that an extracurricular activity at school can be quite useful for the majority of us. If activities such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas are available, then many of our students would be intrigued with doing the activities that have been provided from our school principal and other faculty members. Since the decision has been made for all of the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity from the principal, then maybe the decision for bringing new activities along with it will also be approved as well.\n \n In the school that I am currently attending as of today, sports are an extremely big interest for quite a bit of students. Football, baseball, field hockey, and softball are just some of the sports that are mentioned from the different athletes that are streaming through the school's hallways every single day. Yes, there are already students doing sports anyways, but there are some students who have the perfect capabilities to do them, but they just do not put full effort into doing the sports. There are already plenty of different sport related activities through the schools, and it would be easy for these students to be included in doing the sport that they would be interested in, but all it takes is determination and full-on effort to make it happen.\n \n With the already large number of performing and visually artistic students in the building, there are many different opportunitiesÂ that newcomers may be able to do if they are just starting out. In the building we have a choral teacher, a drama teacher, and 2 art teachers, who are all extremelyÂ helpful, and are there for any questions that a curious student may have about the fine arts community and how to get interested. If more people get interested every year, then I am sure that making more activities that involve the community will be less of a challenge for the principal, and for others who are putting in to create ideas. If more students consider being in the fine arts community, then that would be a successful achievementÂ for the school itself and our work may be recognized by even more people outside of the school as well.\n \n In the day and age that we are all in as of right now, technology is at its finest point in time. With the addition of iPhone's, iPad's, Microsoft computers, and many more devices beyond that, we all have the ability to create different ideas and to make different extracurricular activities for all of the students who are interested in doing things with technology. As technology does grow every day, so should the amount of activitiesÂ that we can do with it as well. Many students are in fact somewhat involved with technology and if the opportunity came along for them to have an in-school interaction with it, then they would maybe have a new hobby or a new interest that could help them in their own lives.\n \n In conclusion, I do standby my principal's decision to have every student be involved in an extracurricular activity and I see why he is making it that way. If we add the activitiesÂ such as sports, performing and visual arts, and technologically focused ideas to the mix, then we will have a great lineup of the activities that the students can do. In the long run, these activitites may end up doing well for us all, and they could even put a great impression on our school.",

        "There could be a rule that states each student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I agree with it, and here's why. It allows students to stay occupied or active, It gives students the ability to socialize with friends in and out of school, it could introduce a student to an activity that they have no idea they like until they try it, or it might even give them an idea on what they might want to do for a job as an adult. I think that allowing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, can help a student grow as a person.\n \n I think participating in activities after school is a great idea for all students. I believe that extracurricular activities keeps students occupied or active. For example, sports offer students not only a source of exercise, but it also gives them a form of entertainment and a chance to meet new people with your same interests or have fun with the people you already know. After school activities don't only have to be sports though, there's a variety of options, like music, strategy activities, or art. These allow you to either do more of what you love, or maybe find something new. Also, it could allow them to make new friendships with others. By participating in something like this, can give the student an idea on what they might want to do for a living as an adult. As a student you might not know what to do for a living, but extracurricular activities can allow a student to find a hobby and give them a gist of what they might want to study later on. Finally, these after school activities allow students to practice skills that will help them throughout their life, like strategy, athleticism, and socialization.\n \n Overall, I think that having a rule that makes all students participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea because it keeps students active and participating in something, it allows you to socialize with ones you don't know and ones you do, it also gives you more options for a hobby, maybe you could find something that you are interested in to study later in life, it can give you a chance to find something new that you didn't know you liked before, and finally, it practices important skills that will help you throughout your entire life. Therefore, that is why I think that allowing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, can help a student grow as a person.",

        "Has your school ever made you join extracurricular activities? If not that's totally okay! My school wants students to really get their hands on learning and exploring new things. Personally I think that's a great idea, because students are not only helping their selvesÂ stay busy but helping out their school. Because sometimes our school needs a little pick me up I think in some spots it could use a little makeover and that's okay. Some extracurricular activities you could do are, joining a sport, helping out with yearbooks and redecorate things, or you could even paint or rebuild some things too!\n \n Joining a sport can take time away from doing homework or other things, but thats what being a student athlete is about! At some points it can be really rough and stressful but really it's preparing you for the stressful things in the future. You may not think joining a sport could help you or your school but in certain situations it really can. Some schools have put tons of money into sports like buying new equipment etc. So why not continue on of what people in the past have put money into. Joining sports can be a big deal but no matter what just think about how much you are helping out.\n \n Another thing you could do is help out with yearbooks. Sometimes it can be really stressful for teachers, so why not lend another helping hand and see where it takes you. I mean you never know, they may really like the way you helped out and may ask you to do other things! You never know what the future holds. Not only can you help out with yearbooks, you could also help outÂ by redecorating some things in your school. Just throw your opinion right in there! It could also turn into something you really enjoy and you could continue on with that. Then all you have left to do is say thank you to your principal.\n \n If you enjoy painting or building and you want to help out, let someone know and your school can definitely help find something you can do to help. One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking.\n \n In so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be. This is why i love doing extracurricular activities! Show what you can do and do it. I believe in you!",

        "I disagree with the decisionÂ that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.\n \n Here are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.\n \n However there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricularÂ activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.\n \n I think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.\n \n In conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.",

        "I agree with the principals decision that all students should participate in atleastÂ one extracurricular activity, it helps students learn new things, make new friends, and have a break from the daily stresses of school. In todaysÂ tough and rigorous education system, students of all ages come home stressed, worried, tired, and upset. The goal is not just to learn anymore but to succeed and ace every single exam. I believe that if everyone had a relaxing and enjoyable activity with no grades or stress, school would become a much more enjoyable place for students, and become a healthier environment for students to successfully thrive in.\n \n This decision will help in four aspects of the students health; academically, physically, socially, and mentally. Academically, like mentioned in the previous paragraph, is greatly improved. Students need a break from the constant testing and late night studying and hours of homework. Personally I know many, many students who are up late at night and up early in the morning, cramming for their many school projects. An activity for them once a week would greatly reduce their sky high stress levels and lead to a better education. For example, I personally know that when I'm extremely confused or worried with my school work, all it takes is ten minutes outside and I feel a lot more calmed down and ready to focus and tackle my homework. I strongly believe that adding this program will rise so many students grades up by a lot.\n \n The next aspect is how this is physically beneficial. Every day students are cooped up in their classrooms, in their uncomfortable chairs, straining their eyes. Once middle school begins you can say goodbye to recess, and when high school starts you begin ninety minute classes. The sitting around for hours on end just gets worse and worse as the workload increases. Those who choose to play sports can make sure to get in their healthy amount of excersize and stay fit and active. Those who do an art class or take pictures for the yearbook are still up, moving and stretching, this is crucial to a growing students health after sitting for seven hours. Students deserve the opportunity to get up and move around because many are sore and tight after sitting for so long. It may not be easy to realize but just giving them that hour of movement after school is so, so beneficial to their health.\n \n The last two aspects are mentally and socially. Mentally has been touched on already, the brain needs a new activity, a break from the constant learning, to explore new paths and try new things. Expand the boundaries of you mind in ways you don't in school. However another aspect of this is emotion. Happier, more social students can usually perform better because they have things to look forward to after school that keeps them positive throughout the day. Some students who are having trouble making friends, or are new to the area can now find a whole group of people to spend time with, and better yet all these people have the same interests as them. This can really benefit some lonely students. It can really make the difference for their grades too, when they become a lot more outgoing. I remember one year, a new girl moved to our school and was rather lonely, she joined the musical, got the lead, and by the end of the year had lots of supportive friends and fellow theatre enthusiasts cheering her on. It was great to see how being a part of something really helps you expand your friend groups and meet people you would have never spoken to if not for the activity. It goes to show how positivity and a better outlook help keep up your energy to really engage with your classes and teachers.\n \n In conclusion, it is crucial for a students proper development and overall educational experience that they are given a break from the demanding tasks of school to enjoy themselves. To give themselves some time to relax, and simply do what they enjoy while meeting new people, learning new things, becoming healthier, becoming happier, and more prepared to conquer the next day of school. I truly believe this decision will greatly benefit the overall health and well-being of all students.",

        "Imagine, one day you're at school, and you hear over the loudspeaker that all students in the building must report immediately to the Lecture Hall, for some new \"\"adjustments\"\". Although you are a bit surprised by this sudden announcement, you walk towards the Lecture Hall at a leisurely pace (as if you were anticipating something like this to happen). Once you're there, you sit in a chair and wait for all the other students to come rushing in like a stampede of wildebeests. After everything settles down, the principal picks up a mic from a lectern on the stage and starts a speech. In this speech, he talks about how the after schoolÂ clubs are experiencing a steep decline in the number of students that attend them. He presents the crowd with a solution to this problem, a solution that is greeted with some harsh criticism from the majority of the student body. He says that, in order to keep the after schoolÂ program alive, all students will be forced to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, and that all students who chose to not follow this new rule will be expelled. Bewildered by this, you yell out in protest of this new policy, but to no avail. For the principal has already left the stage, and now you have to be a part of one of those worthless, unnecessary, and boring after schoolÂ clubs. As you can see, it is detrimental, to both the students and the school as a whole,Â to force all of the students in a school into participation in an after schoolÂ activity. Due to a plethora of factors along with the one I just described, I wholeheartedly disagree with my principal on forcing every student in the school to attend an after schoolÂ club. If you don't believe me already(in regards with this issue at my school), then hopefully the following paragraphs will succeed in persuading you.\n \n First of all, making it mandatory for all students in a school to attend at leastÂ one club takes away some of their freedom with how they experience their lives. By this, I mean that, by forcing students to go to an after schoolÂ club, you are limiting their options for what they can do after school is over. This is due to the simple fact that, once the student chooses their club(s), the time that that club occupies can't really be used for anything else and takes up a big chunk of the student's schedule. To give context, allow me to give you an example. Lets say that Generic_Name, a seventh grader, decided to take\n \n Quiz Bowl as his extracurricular activity. Immediately all regular activities from 2:30- 5:30 are canceled. In addition to this, he now has to go to some weekend meetings, resulting in him not have time to hang out with his friends anymore, study for school, do all of his homework, or go to the gym. Instead, he now has to guess answers to random questions about the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and wait till about 6:00 PM to get picked up by his bus, and then dropped off at home at almost 7:00 PM, completely exhausted and burned out. As, you can hopefully see, having to do even just one after school activity can take a lot time out of a students life, and in extension a lot of freedom with their life.\n \n Second of all, with this new policy, transportation can become an incredibly detrimental issue for students that suddenly have to take at leastÂ one extracurricular activity. This is because there will always be some students in a school who can't take the bus and have parents that work too far away to be able to pick them up, making it nearly impossible for those students to get home safely, or on time. In addition to this, transportation can be a huge issue in the fact that, with\n \n ALL\n \n students having to take an after schoolÂ activity, on any given day, buses could have to leave behind some students because of a shortage of seats, leaving those who were left behind with no options to get back home. For example, let's say that all the students decide to participate in an extracurricular activity on the same day. With all of those students, it would be near impossible for them all to get a bus rideÂ home. And because of all the parents that have to work during the time that those students would get picked up, the school would be left with a large crowd of students that have no way of getting home on time.\n \n Finally, this policy will probably create a harmful school environment. By this, I mean that it would result in a multitude of considerably hard-to-deal-with problems. Such problems would be: an unmotivated student body, protesting from parents, and an unproductive student body. The lower school morale may stem from anger in students at the principal, and teachers that are exhausted from being overworked due to the fact that most of them will have to host at leastÂ one after schoolÂ club; the parents might complain due to the fact that they won't be able to interact with their children as much, and because they might not like the discontent in their children; and unproductivity would be caused by students burning out from the extra time that they have to spend in school. In addition to all of these problems, students might also try to not participate in extracurricular activitiesÂ resulting in extreme punishments(i. e expulsion).\n \n To wrap it all up, there are a lot of reasons as to why my principal's new policy on extracurricularÂ activities isn't very great. It limits a students freedom, it can't really function due to the lack of transportation that is needed for all of the students, and it creates a bad school environment. For these reasons, I think that the principal shouldn't have made this policy.",

They can discover new things about themselves that they didn't know, and because of a sport, club or activity that they joined it can be a life changer for them.\n \n If more students did activities outside school, that helps them be more social, talk more with other people and meet new people, have new friends and just haveÂ a better social life than they did before. If they do a sport like soccer, basketball, volleyball or any type sport, they will have to talk. They will have to talk with their team mates, tell them what he/she is thinking about to make the game even better and have new strategies for the game. Just like this also in any other activity. This little things about having to talk to people they don't really know will take them out of their comfort zone. At the beginning they might not like it because it's something they probably have never done before, and it probably be weird at the beginning but that's a good sign that they feel weird, because it means that little by little they are getting out of what they are used to do, and that makes them learn a whole new world that they didn't know about.\n \n Doing any activity outside school also work makes people more productive and active. It converts the that way by making them get up and move, to go somewhere for them to finish and accomplish that activity. Having a goal in their mind about to go and win that game, or finish sewing where they left of yesterday or last week, finish that one book they were brainstorming about what to write about for like a week and finish investigating what they say that day while he/she was in that cave. Things like that it what makes people be more active and productive. That way people be more active because they always have in their mind theirÂ goal to finish it, and it gives them a feeling of excitement and suspense about what will happen in the future or about what they are about to discoverÂ and will learn. Because they always have that goal in their mind, that one thing they want to finish and accomplish, it makes them be a better person. For teenagers is even better for them to feel that way. If they do they will not want to stay home all day doing nothing just eat, sleep and repeat, they will not want to, because they will want to know more. If they get out of the home and do more activities outsideÂ the house, it makes them become more healthy, stronger mentally and physicallyÂ and it makes he or she have a whole new point of view on how to see life, by just staying home and go out and do new things. He or she will also influence it's family and friends, just by doing that activity. And how he or she influence other people even without wanting to. Well, people will see the you or them have changed so they will want to try it or copy you, because they will also want to change for good.\n \n Like alwaysÂ everyone has a lot of stress as some point in their lives, and that can be harmful for humans. Also for mental and physical health because what you have in your mind your body will reflect it. Stress is one of the most commonÂ problems people have in their lives, it's something that does not go away easily and if you don't know how to control it, you can harm yourself, other people around you and people you love. That's why doing outside school/work actives may help you and other people a lot to deal with their stress. Because it mostly refreshes you mind about any thought you have, worry or feeling that has been going around in your head for a couple of days. It refreshes your mind a lot, because the activity that you are doing will distract you from any personal or just problems that you have, because you will mostly need to concentrate on the activity you are doing. If you don't have or do anything that can help you with that and don't know how to control it, you can lead yourself to make bad things, and that can get you to have even more stress and problems. Outside activities are helpful for your life over all, try it one day, maybe you will find it fun.Â Â",

        "It's the last play of the State Championship you have the ball at midfield your going as fast as you can go but you know your not fast enough to out maneuver the defender insight but, you sidestep and the defender goes flying past and you walk into the end zoneÂ untouched to win the game. You look up into the stands and you see your entire town chanting your name then, you look back down to the sideline and you see your team, your brothers coming towards you and they lift you up on their shoulders and in that moment you feel like your the king of the world. This is what goes through your head as you hear your principal inform the whole school that everyone has to participate in a extracurricular activity. IÂ agree that everyone should have to participate in a activity because there are so many good things that can come from them. Here are some reasons I suggestÂ that it is vital for someone to participateÂ in a extracurricular activity.\n \n Leadership is one of the most used traits people use it is vary important in your everyday life and in general it's a good character trait to have. First things first you need leadership skills in school let's say your put into a group with some people for a group project. Subsequently,Â no one is motivated to do any work so you take the reins and you jump right in and you start assigning people objectives to meet. With your leadership skills your group gets an A+ for the project all because you took charge. Another reason leadership is important is in sports if you play a position like me goalie, you always have to be controlling the defense or say your the quarterback of the football team you have to be able to communicate with the team and tell them the plays and control the offense. Most important of them all is when your an adult and you have to mange a small group of workers, you assign a worker project to complete by next week. That worker doesn't turn the project in on time and your boss gets mad at you because you were supposed to be managing it and making sure it is done on time.\n \n Having friends in Middle School and High School are important for every kid, teen, and even adults. New kids struggle every day tryingÂ to make friends with others and people have already been friends for 3 year now. A great way for people to make friends with people is through extracurricular activities. Because, the new person and the people in the club or sport share the same interests they have a way to talk to each other. When I first moved to Generic_School I had no clue who any of these people were but, when football season came around and I signed up my team became my second family I knew them like brothers and we stayed together for years.\n \n Some parents won't be happy with the change to their kids schedule but, that is expected when you are making kids do stuff that is new to them. But, when you look at major cities like New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan extracurricular actives are changing their cities for the better. It's keeping the kids off the streets and they are less likely to have been roped into gang related activities. Even kids mortality rate has dropped rapidly since cities have implementedÂ rules that make kids join sports teams or clubs. That shows that making kids do extracurricular activates has helped kids in bad areas stay safe and have a higher chance of making something of their lives.\n \n In this passage I have presented you with some reasons I agree that is vital for schools to implement the rule that all students have to participate in extracurricular activities. This rule will forever change schools in the up and coming years for the better. I suggestÂ that all schools should have this rule implemented for safety and to help their kids build social skills, leadership skills for them to use in their futures. This rule would show kids competitive environments because that's what it is like in the real world.Â  Â Â Â Â",

        "Extracurricular activities, which are activities you can participate in and enjoy the things you would want to do after school such as sports, writing, and any after school activities your school can offer for the students. You're able to choose when and which after school activities you want to go too, but should every student be obligated to participate in extracurricular activities. Why students shouldn't be obligated to take part of an extracurricular activity. After school activities are something you should enjoy and not something to be forced to do and here's why. Some students might have a lot of stuff going on while they aren't at school. Students might also not like participating in after school activities due to no interest in the activities. Possibly students could see extracurricular activities as more stressful than fun.\n \n A students' time after school could be very valuable and partaking in after school activities could always be very time consuming. Sure after school activities could be an hour or two but what if a student has other important things to do out of school. A student could be participating into other activities like sports and might not have time to do homework or study and on top of that being obligated to stay after school. A student might also have pets or siblings to take care of, which would be more important than an after school activity. An obligated extracurricular activity would just be time consuming and might not fit into a students' schedule. The school should understand that students also need time at home because seven hours of learning in school is as already as hard as it is, and then having to go to an after school activity wouldÂ just makeÂ the situation even worse.\n \n There could also be no after school activities a student might have interest in. Some students might have interests that the after school activities doesn't offer them. Even if it's just working on the school year book, an after school activity must be something a student should enjoy after school, not just being forced to do extra work. Just like anything you would want to do, you would participate and join it because you wanted to, and not because of obligation or force too. Just forcing a student to stay after school for something they don't want to do would just make the student dislike school even more. Students should enjoy doing what they want after school which might not even be an extracurricular activity.\n \n Stress would also partake in students having to be obligated to stay after school for extracurricular activities. After a long day at school students would just want to head home and relax from school. Worrying about having to stay after would just cause the student to be more stressed. What if a student didn't have a ride to get back home from after school activities or they were scared of being at school longer, then what would they do in that situation? In case these situations happen what should the solution be? Well since these issues could happen from obligation of partaking in an extracurricular activity, then the only solution should be that after school activities should not be obligated and only stay optional for the better.\n \n Why students shouldn't be forced to participate after school activities. There are many reasons why a student shouldn't be obligated to participate in after school activities and why it should stay optional. Staying after school could stress a student out due to obligation of staying at school for an hour or two more. A student can have other things they do outside of school that after school activitiesÂ can take time away from it. A student might even dislike the activities at the school and would not enjoy their time of staying after school which is the opposite of what after school activities are about. Staying after school is something that'sÂ optional and something you can enjoy doing. All concluded which is the reason why school activities shouldn't be a must.",

        'A few weeks ago, a priest said to me, ""Go the second mile."" That sentence really hit me. I asked myself if I was giving back to the world as much as the world gave me. I\'m sure you know that going the second mile means don\'t do the minimum, go above and beyond. I thought adding this short story would be important because sometimes kids just wanna do the minimum of going to school and then going home. I think that every kid should do at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you succeed with your academic life, do exercise, and have fun.\n \n First, I think that extracurricular activities can help you succeed with your academic life. For example, you can go to a math club if that is what you need help with. This demonstrates that doing extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject. For instance, you can get help from your teacher or coach on a subject that they might know more than you about. This shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to get more help on subjects you might need extra help with. Also, going to an extra class or activity can help you minimize your laziness by having not just to go there, but to complete the work you are given there too. My examples are all evidence of why extracurricular activities can help you do better on a subject.\n \n Second, extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise. For example, you can join a basketball team or soccer team. Joining any sports team would help you do exercise by playing with your teammates and practicing. For instance, you can join a math club, memory club, or any other type of academic club that can help you think and answer questions. This demonstrates that joining and academic club can help you exercise your brain by thinking and answering questions. Another way extracurricular activities can be a way to do exercise is by doing community service for your teachers. Doing community service like cleaning tables or organizing the library is a way to do exercise because you are constantly moving your arms and legs. In this paragraph I showed you how extracurricular activities can help you work your muscles and exercise your brain.\n \n Finally, extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun. For example, you can hang out with your friends. Hanging out with your friends and doing an activity together can not only strengthen your friendship but also can be an excellent way to have fun. For instance, going to a basketball club or a club you really like can be an amazing way to have fun. This is because you get to do an activity that you love not just by your self, but with other people that love it too. Another piece of evidence that shows that extracurricular activities can be a way to have fun is by meeting new people and making friends. Meeting new people and making friends is always fun if you let it be, so it demonstrates that extracurricular activities are a really good way to have fun. Every piece of evidence I wrote here are excellent examples of why extracurricular activities can bring you joy and happiness.\n \n In conclusion, I think that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can help you do better on a subject, help you work your muscles and brain, and bring you joy and happiness. Go try an extracurricular activity with your friends. In case you don\'t like the activities in your school, ask to make a new one. They are always worth the trouble. A very wise religious leader once told me, ""Go the second mile."" I found those words to be the greatest I have ever been told.',

        "Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.\n \n As we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This mayÂ also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.\n \n Our parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whetherÂ it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lotÂ ofÂ money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.\n \n When it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.\n \n Extracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and canÂ take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.",

        "Extracurricular Activities are like music; some people like it, others do not. The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree, for the students may be shy, busy, or have money problems at home.\n \n To begin with, students could be shy. Being shy and put on the spot in front of a group could build anxietyÂ or stress. If they work better alone, being apart of any extracurricular activity means that you work with other kids.\n \n The students may not be athletic, or may not like the clubs the school offers.\n \n For instance, if a student is shy and he or she has to work with a group and express ideas, or if they join a team and have to do certain tricks, their anxiety and stress may increase.\n \n Also, children can be busy, they have a life outside of school just like everyone else.\n \n They might have to take care of others.\n \n When taking care of others its hard to go to a club or sport after school, because when you get home your tired from your long day .\n \n That is not fare to the students because when they get home they will be tired, have to do homework, and take care of somebody.\n \n The kids may have appointments, like doctors appointments dentist appointments, or therapy appointments.\n \n Some appointments can be every night, depending on the circumstances but no oneÂ should miss their appointment.\n \n For example, a students has therapy appointments three times a week with his therapist he should not have to miss his appointments for any club or sport.\n \n In addition, kids may have money problems.

Students who are engaged with the extracurricular are going to more focus on other topics. Extracurricular is a great way to keep students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends.\n \n Having a extracurricular helps keep students active. Most students are on their phone all the time,so by having students participate in a extracurricular prevents them on their phone. I have done an extracurricular in my school, that has help forget about my phone and instead focus on more important on my softball team. Keeping students active on extracurricular helps them focus on the extracurricular they are doing. There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active.\n \n An extracurricular has different options to tryout.

        "Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? Probably so, it'll be beneficial to them.\n \n I think that all students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because it'll give them a new experience, they'll meet new people, and depending on the activity, it can help them develop their future.\n \n An after school activity can give you a new experience, but how? Sometimes, you might not know exactly what you like, so an extracurricular activity could help you learn more about yourself. I mean, even if you dont like it you'll know not to do it again, right? Besides learning more about yourself, trying something new can just be good for you, especially if what you're doing is a sport or something that'll develop your future. Well, maybe your friends might want to brag to others that they were on the football team when they graduate. A sport or even an art activity could help you if you're applying to a job, but it would also give you, in a way, work experience, especially if you're applying to a job that is related to that activity when you're older. Even if you might not like the activity, it will be beneficial to you at some point.\n \n Meeting new people can benefit students. Sometimes, you might not have many friends who have the same hobbies, but when you're joining an activity, especially if it's something that you like, there's bound to be people that have the same hobbies. Who knows, maybe you might find a really good friend there. Meeting new people can make connections, connections are good to have when you're older and you might have a specific job to do. Maybe you might just need something and you remember your friend from that activity became a pretty great manager of a popular company. Usually, when you're joining an extracurricular activity, there's going to be people who are older than you and they have more experience in the activity you might've joined, it would be helpful to you to learn what they have been taught. It's good to learn from other perspectives, don't you think? Making new friends and meeting new people could ease stress with coming up tests, they'll help you relax a little more.\n \n Well, what if students don't want to participate? It can be difficult for a student to participate if something is happening outside of their school life. Sometimes, students might not be able to participate because of family, work, money, or time. There's a point in time where they will have to make exceptions. Besides that, usually it seems like the students around here might not do much outside of school, so they'll be kept a little busy with an activity.\n \n My final thought is that, of course, students should participate because they'll meet new friends, maybe even learn some new skills, and develop themselves and their future. So, go ahead and join an activity, you could really learn from it!",

I think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. They will have the chance to do something that makes them happy. Something that will let their brain take a break from working so hard during school.\n \n Students will be able to make new friends and meet new people. Before I came to middle school I only knew the people from my elementary school and that was it. Until I joined chorus, I made friends with people that enjoyed music as much as I did. It was so much fun to be around new people and to make new friends. Even though we would have to stay after school to practice for up coming concerts it was still worth it. It gave me something to do after school and I could let my brain take a break from comprehending all the learning tactics that I have come across in school. I got the opportunity to do the one thing that makes me happy almost everyday. If students participate in an extracurricular activity it will give them a chance to open up to new people that may stay with them for a long time in their life.\n \n Students will have something fun to do after school. They would get to enjoy something fun that they may want to continue in their future. It gives them a chance to relax and enjoy the things they love to do outside of school. It will be a more enjoyable experience when they are doing something that really makes them happy. One of my friends loves to play sports and it makes her really happy. She was not worried about homework or getting something done right when she got home. Instead she got the chance to let her mind rest from all the learning and power on the part of her brain that helps her enjoy the sport that she loved. Students will have a better time concentrating on there homework after they have had time to relax by doing extracurricular activities.\n \n Students will have the opportunityÂ to learn something new whether it is a new instrument or a new sport. Every day in school you learn new things in all subjects but it is all surrounded around test and quizzes. But when a student decides to take an extracurricular activity they can learn something that will make them much happier and that does not involve test or quizzes. When I was in fourth grade I decided to start playing the violin. I understood that it was a big responsibility taking on something outside of school but it was worth it. I have always loved playing the violinÂ and I continue to play it now. Also I had to stay after school multiple times to practice with everyone in the orchestra. I learned how to make my brain stronger by doing something that was at a different level of difficulty in a different way.\n \n In conclusion, I think that student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. Students might discover something new about themselves that they did not know before they decided to take and extracurricular activity. Students should not have to work so much and not have any time to themselves. Everyone needs time to relax and do the things they love. By relaxing they give their brain a break to recharge and get ready for all the work that will come in the future.",

Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.\n \n Students also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.\n \n Being required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work.

After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.",

Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills, build life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. Yes, i think that all students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\n \n Extracurricular activities are great ways to build social skills. Many people have various forms of social anxiety or they may just be naturally shy, but bonding over something you both enjoy doing can build true friendships that can last a lifetime. For example, i'm a competitive dancer, and i remember when i first stared dancing, i was shy and didnt like to do anything that was out of my comfort zone. Now i'veÂ been dancing for almost 9 years and my favorite people are my friends at my dance studio. While i started off shy and scared to talk to new people, i have become best friends with the people i was shy around, i believe if everyone does a club or activity, everyone would have amazing friendships like mine.\n \n Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social skills and a great way to build life skills too. soccer is a sport that builds control, endurance, and good sportsmanship, while a club like Beta club, is a club that builds leadership skills and gives you the opportunity to help those around you. There is something different with every activity, if you try and find a club or activity that helps to build the skills you are interested in or skills you would like build, then you might just end up having a good time and it might just be something you'll want to do as a profession.\n \n Clubs and Activities are a great way to build social skills, build life skills,and also a great way to enhance your future. Clubs and activities will build skills you will use for the rest of your life. If you do a academic club, you might win first place in a really big category, that win will look really good on your college application. If you do a sport, college scouts might be at your game and they might recognize you and give you a free scholarship to a college and maybe that college will be one you really wanted to go to. Clubs and activities can benefit your future in so many more ways then you might think.\n \n Extracurricular activities are a great way to build social and life skills, and a great way to enhance your future. when your principle asks you if your going to do an extracurricular activity, what will you say?",

        "Imagine you are at your high school graduation, your name gets called up and every one in your grade chants your name. You have came far for this opportunity to go to a top notch university. You would think that it was all of your teachers that helped you. But then you forget about your Math and Science Olympiad coaches, your basketball coach. I believe that schools need extracurricular activities. If my principal told made a rule that every one single one of the kids had to do a extracurricular activity, I would most likely sign up in at leastÂ two or three activities. The reasonsÂ why I think this are, You can learn Important life skills, you gain knowledge of things you didn't know before academically, and it can sometimes be fun.\n \n My first reason why you should have these activities were that you can learn a bunch of life skills that would very useful in the future. Like teamwork. Teamwork is a very important skill you need to learn. In the future when you get a job. You will need to work with your coworkers. Sometimes you know your coworker an other times you will get paired with someone you will not know. It is always very important to know how to work with other and communicate with them when necessary. My second example is that it teaches time management. When I was in Odessy of the Mind, I had little to know time to do my homework. So I would do my homework at school and not worry about it when I would get home. This is why so you can just chill in you home or do other priorities. Third and final example is Responsibility. Let's all be honest. We all learn responsibility when we were very young. I learned it before I started Preschool. I will give you an example on why responsibility is so important. You are playing football. You are the center. Your job is to snap the ball to the quarterback and block the big defensensive tackles and linebacker. If you don't do you are responsible for, then the quarterback will get tackled for a lose of yards, or he will get hurried to throw the ball and will throw a bad pass. This is why this skill is so important. You need to what your job is and how to do it.\n \n My second reason why you should have these activities is that you gain knowledge academically. When you go to a extracurricular activity to do with math or science, you will learn new things from an academical standpoint. Take math for an example. Let's say you are in 6th grade. You are talking an after school math advanced math class. Your teacher teaches you the Quadratic Formula. Look at you now, you are in 6th grade and you know how to do quadratics. Also, take science for an example. They teach you a ton of things, maybe you are in 7th grade and talking an extracurricular class of physics. Great job, now you know what a black hole is. Okay, my last example is that you are in student council, now you know how to stand up and talk to people and know how rules get passed. I could list hundreds of examples. But you can only do this if you have a positive mindset and be there only if you want to be there.\n \n My third and final reason is that you actually have a lot of fun. If you play a sport such as football and basketball, you get excited and have a ton of fun, Sometimes when in an extracurricular class, you have fun time learning new things that you are interested in learning. You can sometimes have a lot of fun and learn things academically to. You can reduce stress and anxiety, and it can exercise your brain. So from an entertainment standpoint. ExtracurricularÂ activities are really good.\n \n Well I believe that Extracurricular activities are very useful and great de to these three reasons, They teach you very important life skills, they teach you things from an academical standpoint, and the third and last reason was that they are really fun. Extracurricular activities are no classes that you have to get an A on. They are classes the you inquire knowledge out of. They are their to give you the knowledge that you need.",

        "\"\"well not all people like to do other things.\"\" Joining a different activity is not what a lot of people like to do very much. Kids dont really talking in front of a lotÂ of people because they could be shy or anything. When kids do a extracurricular activity they could agree with people and disagree with people because everyone don't have the same opinion. So I disagree because some could get hurt doing sports , they go visit family and they don't have time to do anything and people is not an out door person and don't talk that much.\n \n Kids could get hurt doing sports , like I was younger at my dad football practice and a boy pop his bond out of place so they call the ER and he had to get things done. Most kids hurt they self though out the year when they're doing sports because they could of been doing things wrong so they hurt themselves. Most people don't like going outside and doing that much activity or like playing sports. A lotÂ of kids like to be healthyÂ if they going to play a sports or anything and they keep their body in shape. Students shouldnt have have participate in a activity if they dont want to and i dont thing they should get force too if they dont want to do it at all.\n \n Most kids don't often go and visit they family so some kids go on trips and visit they family if they don't see them and things. It's good that kids go see they're family, also and kids are shy, they don't talk to people or they're not an outdoor person so they stay in the house and don't talk to no one. It would take up kids time if they want to go visit they family so I think kids should go visit they family if they don't see them that often and if they want to spend time with them. Most people worry about they family so they don't have time to go visit their family that much. Like my family that live far but not that far away from me i would go visit them and still be in things.\n \n Even tho kids are not an outdoor person or dont talk to that much people it they still dont have to do something they dont want to. Kids dont like staying after school for sports or anything only if its something fun and your helping out thats what kids like to do. Doing something could help but students shouldn't have to just do it if they dont want to and its theyre choice if they want to do it or not they dont have to get force to. A lot of kids just dont talk or nothing and they don't do nothing but talk to they friend or stay in the house and not do nothing. Most kids dont even have that much friends they could do or nothing so most kids dont do after school activitys.\n \n Kids just don't go outside or don't do something because they could get hurt or anything. Most kids love doing an activity with their school and then other kids just dont like doing something at all. So I disagree because kids shouldnt have to do something they dont want to do if its in school or out of school. They also dont have to be/get force to do anything. A lot of other kids are like teachers pet and do a lotÂ for teachers and even help out with a lot of teacher with a lotÂ of things . Kids are shy to even do extracurricular activity like help with year books , do sports or anything, most kids dont even see their family like they'er opposite to so kids dont do other activity or sports like that.

        "My principal decided that all students must participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity. I agree with what my principal said about how we must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first benefit is students could be forced into something that they actually love. The second thing is students could be really good at something and just not know. And last is kids can get really lazy sometimes and making them do something can make their life a lotÂ better.\n \n First, students could get forced into something they actually love. If a student decides to play a sport for their activity then they could end up really liking it. The students could end up playing that sport for the rest of their life. If they like that sport and keep playing then they could meet new friends. Overall, extracurricular activities can create great experiences.\n \n Second, Students could be really good at something and just not know. Is someone has never played a sport Then they dont know how good they could be at it. I have a friend that had never played basketball And when he first tried the sport it turns out hes good. Any person that tries a new sport could end up playing with the pros, all you have to do is just try the sport. In the end, being forced to do something could reveal a talent.\n \n Lastly, kids can get really lazy at times and by forcing them to do and extracurricular activity can change their life. For instance, if they have weight issues then you could sign them up for a sport so they can loose some of that weight. Also by making them do an activity it can change a persons view on a certain group of people and maybe make them want to do what those people do. By playing something as a kid can make that person as an adult have a stronger work ethic. In conclusion, doing extracurricular activities as a kid can help you as an adult.\n \n In conclusion, extracurricular activities can help find and create good things for you in life. My first example is students could get forced into something that they actually like. Second, kids can be very talented at something and just not know it. And lastly, kids can get really lazy and by forcing them to do these activities can make them into a new person. By making students do extracurricular activities you can help a lotÂ of kids.",

Well i believe that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity because it creates bonds and builds teamwork skills.\n \n Extracurricular activities create bonds by forcing students to join with one another in a group project so they will make friends among the group. Students will be able to further improve their passion for the activity for example I found out about the D&D club at my school I went to one of their sessions and found out that I really had a passion for the game, I am still enjoying it to this day.\n \n Extracurricular activities build teamwork skills by making students work together to get a task done. For example when I was in D&D me and my group were in a forest when we saw a dead horse on the road two of my teammates were squinting to try and see the details, another one of my teammates was booking it to the horse to try to see what happened and I'm just standing their thinking to my self what are these nut jobsÂ doing then suddenly the teammate who was booking it got jumped by goblins I forced a fire boltÂ at one of the goblins, one of my other teammates is playing ping pong with his short bow, another one puts a knife in a goblins back, the paladin smashes his hammer on one of them, and the wizard throws acid at one we took them all out but the one who booked it died the end.\n \n What should have been taken away from this is that being part of an extra curricular activity helps make bonds and encourage teamwork skills, do you agree or disagree that studets must be in a extracurricular activity.",

As a resultÂ of this you will not have time for the activityÂ your principal wants you to do.

        "Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involvedÂ with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagreeÂ to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family.\n \n My first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worriedÂ about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved.\n \n There for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates.\n \n My final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no oneÂ wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did.

It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club.\n \n This is why i disagree that student shouldÂ have to participant in an activity.

        'Generic_Name hauled his bag over his shoulder and trudged down the hallway. His feet dragged behind him and he hunched a little more with each step. It was decided that students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, even if they didn\'t have an interest in it. Generic_Name had wanted to be on the robotics team, but the positions filled up quickly due to the new policy. Therefore, Generic_Name\'s alternative was joining the football team. He had to purchase a bunch of equipment and then carry a large bag around every day. His friend, Generic_Name, came up to him in the hallway and asked, ""Are you on your way to football practice?"" ""Unfortunately,"" Generic_Name mumbled back. Generic_Name wasn\'t bad at football, he just didn\'t enjoy playing it. Generic_Name knew of several athletes who had wanted to be on the football team, but couldn\'t because too many people who didn\'t want to participate signed up. ""How\'s the student council?"" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name. ""I hate it. I wanted to be apart of the school newspaper, but there were no more positions by the time I signed up,"" Generic_Name responded. This was the scenario for many students. They were pressured into choosing a sport or club that they didn\'t have an interest in. Students who were interested in participating, didn\'t enjoy it as much because those who didn\'t want to participate hindered the progress of others. Generic_Name and Generic_Name didn\'t have the luxury of personal activities after school anymore because they were both forced into extracurricular activities that weren\'t interesting to them.Â I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it takes away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.\n \n The first reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would take away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities. Students may be apart of out of school activities such as recreational basketball, a community robotics team, or a community service committee. Students would be forced to either drop out of these activities or jam their schedule due to the required addition of an extracurricular activity. Also, some students may have after school responsibilities such as walking their dog, meeting a sibling on their way home, or preparing dinner. These responsibilities would be interfered by an unnecessary impediment of disinterest. These extracurricular activities may not catch the interest of some students and take away from their other after schoolÂ activities.\n \n Another reason you should disagree with this decision is because it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate. Students may see this as another activity they\'re being forced into participating in against their will. If a student is truly interested in an extracurricular activity, then they will sign up on their own. But making them participate won\'t be as beneficial as some may think. Imagine if you had to participate in a club or sport that didn\'t interest you in the slightest. Would you be fine with that? Some activities also require specific materials and supplies that aren\'t provided by the school. Some sports and clubs also require a student to carry around a separate bag or wear a specific item of clothing. These required activities can also increase the amount of stress put on students throughout the day. Being forced into choosing an extracurricular activity puts an unnecessary burden on students would don\'t wish to participate.\n \n In addition to taking away from other after school activities and putting a burden on students who don\'t want to participate, this decision would also take away some of the enjoyment from students who do want to participate. When you\'re on a team, whether it\'s a sport or a club, you need to work as a team. If one person on your team isn\'t putting in his or her full effort or holding up his or her end, it makes the experience less enjoyable for those who do participate. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment. Would you want someone who\'s not going to work as hard as everyone else on your team? All it takes is a couple of people to ruin it for everybody else. Students who participate in a club because they\'re interested or desire a future profession in that area of expertise may find it bothersome and not as enjoyableÂ if a student doesn\'t participate. If this decision were put into action, it would take away some of the enjoyment from the students who want to participate.\n \n Generic_Name walked with a spring in his step towards the robotics room. When he arrived, he dropped his backpack and went straight to work. He enjoyed building and designing robots and was able to contribute to his team\'s effort because of his interest. Everyone else on his team had signed up because of their interest as well. As Generic_Name was arranging his tools, Generic_Name walked in behind him with a smile across his face. ""Guess what?"" Generic_Name asked as he flaunted a folded newspaper in his hand. ""What?"" Generic_Name replied curiously. ""I wrote an article on the importance of student choice in school, and the principal liked it so much that he appointed me head of the school paper!"" ""Congratulations, Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name said happily. Generic_Name turned and walked out of the class with excitement and said, ""See you later, Generic_Name."" Generic_Name turned towards the rest of his robotics team and began working. Since he had an intention on joining the team, Generic_Name was able to clear up his schedule after school so he could participate efficiently. Generic_Name felt relieved that he didn\'t have to carry around an extra bag and was satisfied by his team\'s effort. I disagree with the decision of making every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it may take away from other students\' after schoolÂ activities, it would be a burden on the students who don\'t want to participate, and it wouldn\'t be as enjoyable for the students who do want to participate.',

        "How many times have you stepped out of your comfort zone? Maybe once or twice? People always hold back in life from doing something they have wanted to do. Maybe they are scared or fear of being judged. They don't take opportunities when they have it and might regret it later. Having to do another extracurricular activity could open so many doors, for example, meeting new friends, trying something new, and maybe even finding something you're really good at.\n \n You know when you meet a new friend, you're so excited and can't wait for all the fun things you guys will do together! If you did an extracurricular you could have so many of these moments. Making new friends expands your friend group. You can meet people that you probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been pushed to stretch your horizons. And all these people can introduce you to new things that they are interested in like their favorite movie, books, or even their own friends. You could do the same. At this point you might even have double the friends you had before you even did this extracurricular, wouldn't that be fun! Making new friends is just one of the many aspects of trying something new!\n \n For most people their is always that one thing they want to try but never do. Maybe chorus, art, robotics, etc. When you do this extracurricular you finally get the chance to do that one thing you've always had in the back of your mind. Say you tried this new thing, you put in your all in it, and you didn't like it or you weren't good at it. That's OK! Now you know that you tried it. You have no regrets. And you're probably going to have fun along the way even if it didn't end up being your passion. Doing this extracurricular could get you to the activity you always wanted to do even if it's not your life's calling.\n \n My dad always says, \"\"Don't knock it till you try it.\"\". Which basically means don't say you don't like it till you have given it a shot. This applies to so many things like sports, food the list goes on. This activity that you try could be what your really talented at. Maybe not given the opportunity you have never tried it. That would be so sad, getting a talent and you don't even know that you have it. That would just be a waste! If you get an opportunity like this it could lead to many things and even find what you were meant to do.\n \n Trying something new, making friends, and discovering what you're really good at is just a few of the possibilities if you do an extracurricular. Trying something different could open your world, and make you see things in a different light that maybe you looked down on before. You could finally find that one interest that you've been waiting for. And maybe that you're really good at too! Having to do another extracurricular helps you find friends and broadens your friend group! I really think that adding an extracurricular will benefit teens in many ways and really make them branch out which they probably weren't doing in the first place.Â",

        '"" What are you going to choose?"" That is the sound of a student at a school which requires them to do an extra- curricular activity. Students enrolled at this school must do some sort of extra curricular activity, whether it is a sport, a spot on the yearbook club, or serving on the student council. I agree with the requirement of an extra curricular activity because it can help you find people with the same interests and lead you to new interests, it can help create a better community environment and it will help all the students mature and succeed in the future.\n \n Participating in an after school activity can lead you to people that have the same interests and can lead you to other interests. i have been playing lacrosse for about 8 years now and as I\'ve played throughout the years, I have discovered many different hobbies through my teammates such as cheer leading, track and field and rock climbing. I\'ve also been able to make friends because I\'m on a different team every season. I have made about 3 lifetime friends in lacrosse. I think this can happen with school lead activities. I think by being part of an after school activity, you can make lifelong friends, find people with the same interests and discover new hobbies.\n \n Doing an after school activity can help create a better community environment. this kind of relate back to the previous statement about making friends.\n \n by making friends, you can create less bullying. there is this saying, ""strength in numbers"", and I truly think this would happen with an after school activity requirement rule. By installing an activity requirement, you would help build a bully-free community.\n \n Lastly, an after school activity would help students mature and prepare themÂ for the future. I babysit a little boy with downs-syndrome and i often take him to the park. When we leave, you tell he is a little bit more mature from when we first arrived. this is because hen has played with older kids and have copied their actions. I believe this goes with all kids. if we had an after school activity program and we put all the grades together, it would help the younger one mature but also the older kids could teach them how to do things that they will need to know in the real world.\n \n I think everyone should be involved in some sort of group, whether it be school related or not. Maturing kids, better community environments and finding new friends can all happen with a required after school activity program.',

Students will not have time to do their homework after school. They might not have time to finish a project they been signed or to study for a test. Students will not have time to go out and hang out with their friends or spend time with their families. For example, students will not have time to eat dinner with their families.\n \n Next, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students might already do other activities after school. Students might already participate in after school sport but no play a school sport. If students are 15 years or older they can start working and some students might want a easy after school job. They probably want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school. For example, take dance classes or instrument classes.\n \n In addition, another reason why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can get stressed and tired. If students get stressed their grades can go down and their parents can get mad. Students can get tired and sleepy in class and teachers will keep on saying, ""keep your head up"" during class. It will be hard for students to keep up with their work in class for example, they will not finish on time.\n \n Finally, students will not have time to finish their homework or projects they have and no time to be will their families and friends. They will want to do other fun and enjoyable activities after school like other classes. If students do get into a extracurricular activity they can get stressed or tired and their grades might go down. This are the three reasons why students should not participate in at least one extracurricular activity after school.',

        "Imagine your principal said you had to participate in some type ofÂ extracurricular activity, how would you feel?\n \n Would you feel like you are being forced or unable to decide what you do in your life?\n \n Well, for many students this is happening to them.\n \n I disagree with this decision because, some students have things they have to do after school, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do, and some parents dont have the time nor the money to do extracurricular activities.\n \n First, some students have things they must do after school, at home some parents leave things for their kids to do that may prevent them from doing extracurricularÂ activities.\n \n A parent reliesÂ on their kids to watch younger siblings so they dont get in trouble.\n \n In the afternoon the students might have to go see or help a sick family member or friend.\n \n Sometimes parents also leave lists of chores they expect the kids to be finished with before they arrive home, and its part of the kids responsibilities to get them done.\n \n Also most teachers give out homework that the kids have to turn in next class, when these students have 6-8 classes and homework in most of then it may be hard to juggle anything else.\n \n Secondly, its the students life and they should be in control of what they do.\n \n Sometimes kids just dont want to do something, it may be because of social life or their life at home.\n \n Its also their choice rather they want to do it or not, because its their mind and body.\n \n only parents or guardians have the right to force their kids to do something, the school shouldnt be allowed to tell students they have to join extracurricularÂ activities if the just dont want to.\n \n Your only a kid once and these students should be able to enjoy their childhood without having to cut out time for extracurricularÂ activities they they are being forced to do.\n \n Lastly, some parents or guardians dont have the time or money to let their child participate in extracurricularÂ activities.\n \n Some parents only have enough money to pay the bills and keep foo on the table, they dont need to pay fees just so their child can participate in extracurricularÂ activities.\n \n The parent might not have the time off that they need to join the child in club meets or sports games, because they work long hours.

        "Should students part take in a extracurricular? well I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because, it gets students more involved with his or her community and keeps students active and on their feet. This will teach students many skills that could benefit them in the future.\n \n First off, you can learn so many things off of joining or participating in a extracurricular. For example, joining a sport can teach a student leadership skills, listening skills, time management, teamwork, and many other skills that students could use for future use. Joining a sport discovered many things I didn't already know about myself. I learned my set limits, how to prepare myself for certain situations, and how being aware and proactive can effect me greatly, was a great learning experience for me. Therefore, you should give an extracurricular a try, maybe you'll enjoy it it a lot.\n \n Next, Joining an extracurricular activity can get you more intertwined with your community and your school. This leading to building great relationships between others or making a new ones. For example, I joined the soccer team then soon to have met one of my bestÂ friends, they're the most supportive, kind, caring, and most definitely the funniest people i've ever ran into. That decision was one of the best choices i've ever made. In addition, You'll get to meet all kinds of people from around your community, learning more about them each day and everyday, how similar or how different they're from you. At the end of it, it is nice to see all different or similar types of people that are surrounding you in your daily life.\n \n In conclusion, I think you should join an extracurricular because you can benefit so much off of it. Including many life skills that will help you such as, communicationÂ skills, leadership skills, listening skills and many more skills that will help you along your path. Getting to know the people around you is a nice experience that I think every person should have the opportunity to get. Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â",

      essay:
        "To most students, school is like a black hole that they would do anything not to fall into. Kids go to school and sit for seven hours, and then go home and do almost the same thing. It's not healthy for them and it makes them dread school even more. Students are constantly falling asleep throughout the day because they don't have anything to look forward to, and that makes them feel as if school isn't as important as it is. If they don't have any fun, then they won't try in school whatsoever. If students are doing extracurricular activities, they'll be way more active and less tired throughout the day. I think that students should be required to do an extracurricular activity because it will get them involved in their school, it will keep them active in many ways, and they will learn more about everything around them.\n \n First, Extracurricular activities will get students involved in their school. For example, they'll be representing their school. You're representing your school in any activity you pick, but you especially if you're playing a sport. Sports teams are like little families in the school, and the people playing on them love their teammates and love the place they're playing for. If all the kids are required to do an extracurricular, and get to choose to play a sport, they'll get to meet lifelong friends and be the face of their school. This can make students love school so much more than they used to. Next, they will also be just as involved in their school if they do an activity like yearbook. In yearbook, you're constantly learning about the kids in your school and all your surroundings. Most kids barely get to know half of the people in their grade, but if they're learning about the people around them, they can get to know almost everyone. Finally, it'll be a chance for them to make new friends. As I said, most students barely get to know everyone they go to school with, and a lot of times they're to shy to try to get to talk to new people. When they're put in a club or an after schoolÂ activity, they learn how to communicate with others. Clubs could help so many people make new friends.\n \n Secondly, it will keep students active in many ways. For instance, playing a sport would be very good for any and all students. Constantly moving and exercising would help them stay active and fit, which is good for everyone. Most of your years in school you are required to do physical education, but sometimes you're barely even moving during the class. Sports will keep kids much more active than any class could. Also, being involved in an activity like student council or yearbook would keep their brains running and being used. They would always be coming up with new ideas and working on them/figuring out how to pursue them. When most students go home, they shut off their minds and are barely using them, causing them to not be as prepared to use them the next day. If they have to stay after schoolÂ for student council or yearbook, they'll still be using their brain. Lastly, students will actively learn communication skills. Communicating is so important in your life and will forever help you. You can't be in a club or play on a sports team and never learn how to communicate, because of this they will actively be learning new communication skills.\n \n Finally, these activities can help students be more confident. First off, some students think that they are alone in this world and that they is no one else is like them. If students join clubs that interest them, it'll show them that they are not alone and that there are other people that are similar to them. Even if they aren't doing something they're familiarÂ with, there will be other kids that are also trying it for the first time. Second, clubs and groups teach them how to talk to people. As I have said, you can't be involved in a group or on a team and not communicate with them. If students are basically required to talk to other people during the activities, it'll boost their confidence and help them talk to new people on their own. Last but not least, these activities will show them that they are good at something. It is very common for young kids to think that they are horrible at everything, especially if school and learning isn't their strong suit. These clubs can show them that they do have skills and are good at something.\n \n In conclusion, I think that students should have something to look forward to in school and not want to do anything to be out of going. They shouldn't have to wake up in the morning and dread going to a place they should love. This is why extracurricular activities should absolutely be a requirement. They have so many benefits and there will be many good outcomes. If extracurricularÂ activities become a requirement, students will become more involved in their school and everything around them, they will stay active in multiple ways and constantly be fit, and these activities will help boost up their self confidence.",

        'Whenever you get home, do you do your homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don\'t then you are either a very responsible kid, or you have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and the other half go home and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with him because it teaches the students responsibility, helps them with college later on, and they won\'t be on their phones all day.\n \n One reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach them to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while they are still in school, it will help them succeed in their later life as an adult.\n \n Another reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can help with finding a college later on in life. If you chose a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really help you in the future when you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are really good at a certain sport by the time of your sophomore year, you probably have a very high chance of making it on your school\'s team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if they think you are good enough for their school, they will probably offer you either a full-ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that they can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by ""earth gov"" asked adults which college they went to and if they were involved in an extracurricular activity during theirÂ high schoolÂ years. About 90% of adults said that they got into college due to a extracurricular they were involved in during high school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.\n \n On the other hand, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. They already have enough stress as it is, we don\'t need to add extra weight onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can help teens not spend the entire after school time on their phones. The article ""Are Phones Good for Teens"" writes, ""most of all teens have access to a smart phone, and once they are let out of school and get home, the average teen spends 5 to 76 hours on their phone instead of doing their homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities."" Another article titled ""Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College"" states that ""when kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat they are deeply involved in extracurricular activites like sports, working on their school\'s yearbook, or being on the student council of their school."" If the universe was filled with more kids like these then the world would have a larger population of successful young adults than it has right now.\n \n In conclusion all students should be obliged to be involved in extracurricular activities becuase it helps them learn how to be responsible in their future life, it can help student get into a good college and be successful in life, and it can keep students off of their phones all day. To save our earth, the first step is saving the future generation.',

        "Should there be a rule on everyone taking extracurricularÂ activities. Yes because they provide information and fun for the students. Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity becauseÂ we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricularÂ activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject.\n \n Extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students.\n \n By taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone.\n \n Being active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active.\n \n Extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends.

        "If you were told that you had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, how would you feel? While normally an extracurricular activity is optional, now everyone has to participate in one. This is an unreasonable thing to do, what if some students don't like the activities that they provide? Some students already have other things to do after school, so it's just putting more stress on them. Schools shouldn't take away student's after school time, that time is the only time that they get to relax.\n \n Schools have a limited option of extracurricularÂ activities, so students may not be able to find something they enjoy. Let's say that all the students could choose from sports, the yearbook, or the student council. Most students wouldn't enjoy that as much, so they would feel obligated to choose an activity they don't enjoy. Although some students may enjoy those activities, not all will. If the principal wants to enforce this, they'll have to add more options for extracurricular activities.\n \n A lot of students already have other activities they do after school, that would make students more busy and have less time to have some free time to themselves. Most teachers give out homework for students to do at home. If they are busy with extracurricular activities. Because of this they'll most likely not have time to do their homework or not have time to take a break.\n \n After school, most kids come home tired or exhausted. They want a little time to themselves since they had to do a lot of work at school and now they'll have to do work at home. If too much stress or tension is put on them, there can be tons of negative effects. Such as low performance in schools, when they come to school they'll be tired from all the work they had to do yesterday. This is why schools shouldn't make after school activities mandatory. Putting more work on them is not going to help them, what will help is giving them time to take a break, having some time to themselves may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way.\n \n With all of these reasons, certainly making students do an extracurricular activity seems like a terrible idea. It's not necessary for schools to take time out of their day when they're not at school. Students get tired, schools should understand that. Participating in an extracurricular activity is not going to do them any good, some students already have activities to do. Saying that they have to choose at least one activity shows that the school doesn't expect much of them, but they are already expecting students to take away their free time for some after school activity that won't even be much of a help to them.",

I agree with this statement because extra circulars can introduce new friendships and create fun while exploring hobbies.\n \n After school programs can provide new friends. Many people that join a club or school sport are just trying something that they haven\'t before and need some encouragement from a peer or someone to talk to. When I joined the school play last year it was a requirement to tryout. I was very nervous, but with the help of the rest of the cast I sang in front of a whole crowd and was cast a role. Sometimes there are students who are in the classes of others and may never talk to them, extra circulars are the perfect time to ask them questions and make them feel comfortable. In my History class there was a girl named Generic_Name, she was very shy but also very sweet. We rarely talked until we both joined the Best Buddies program and were partners for everything, we became very good friends and still talk to this day. Lastly, there is a chance to meet someone with similar interests as others. My mother met her best friend from the school basketball team when she was in junior high, they both loved basketball and continued to play together throughout high school. Extra curricular activities can bring together so many people and create new friendships.\n \n After school programs can bring so much excitement and joy into students lives by trying new hobbies. Extra circulars come in many forms such as; plays, art, sports, or even technology clubs. By joining a sports team the coaches provide fun activities while still exercising,Â and in a club like the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) the leaders teach life lessons and helpful skills. I am a NJHS leader and our goal is to plan meetings after school that others enjoy while being informed as well. In these programs there may be a hobby that people never knew they liked. My friend went to the field hockey interest meeting and learned all about the sport from real players, she had so much fun that she tried out for the high school team and made Varsity! The activities are also beneficial to more than one group of students. Some kids with disabilities stay after school waiting for a ride home from their parents, as a result programs were created for scholars to stay with them and help do entertaining projects. At many schools they have the ""iCan Bike"" club, a club also for kids with disabilities to learn how to ride a bike without training wheels, using help from student volunteers the club fund raisesÂ money for the Special Olympics. Extra curricular activities make trying new things fun and helpful.\n \n In conclusion, I agree that students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. These programs can help others meet new people that are similar to them and create enjoyment with taking part in new hobbies that will provide happiness.',

Sports aren't meant for everyone or you might not just have the ability to do sports, if the students decide to not participate in sports or the other options it shouldn't be a big deal,some may not want to do an extra class. The principal's choice or option really shouldn't be a must.

        'Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all\n \n Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students and tremendously decreases the time that aÂ student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.\n \n Generic_School students should not have to regularly participate in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.\n \n Generic_School students should not have to consistently partake in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called ""Generic_Name\'s Work Zone"" or ""WWZ."" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name\'s Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be.Â That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.\n \n I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student\'s energy and can negatively impact a student\'s health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact.',

        "Your sitting home alone with nothing to do wastingÂ away with boredom, if so then you should do some extracurricular activity. I agree because, I think kids having to do extracurricular activities for school help them, and lets them help. These activities give kids things to do, may help them make friends, and gives them a chance to help others.\n \n First, extracurricular activities give young people something to do. This will get them out of their houses. These children have to go and help their team with the extracurricular activity that they chose. It will also make them use their brains. It teaches them to think outside of the box and to make creations from a thought. Lastly, it can also help them manage their time wisely. If they have other activities that give work or are near the same time, this will help them by learning what is more important or what they care more about. Some students might struggle to find time to do these activities, but they can chose what and when their activities should be.\n \n Secondly, these activities will help kids make new and lasting friendships. Make them work with others. Because these are all run by the school you will have to meet new people regardless, so why not try to make a lasting impressionÂ to the people you work with. Have them go on group outings. The children may not be friends with anybody yet and are looking for something to do, group activities are prefect, not only do you do fun stuff with your group, but also get to know them a bit better. They will help each other. If you have problemsÂ with home work or a problem with some one around school the others in your group can, and will help you with the problemsÂ that you may have. Kids may be shy and don't want to talk to others they don't know this will help them break the ice with a few people so they have some friends to hold them up.\n \n Lastly, this gives them a chance to help others. They can help friends. if a friend needs help on understanding their part of the extracurricular activities or home work then you can help them to understand what they are suppose to do. You can help the school. If you are in student council and think of a way to better the school then you have the power to do what you think is right for the school and students. Finally, this give students a chance to help the community. The students could find ways to benefit the place where they live making it cleaner, safer, or in anyway better. If someone is having a hard time think of how good it would feel to help them out.\n \n Extracurricular activities do influence kids to better themselves, their school, and community. One way was giving these students something to do to improve themselves. Another is making new friends making others lives better helping both school and community. Last is helping others in any way needed for home work, a project, or just by listening. Think of how much better it would feel to help others even if you didn't want to join an extracurricular activity.",

        "My principal, Mr. Generic_Name, has just announced that all students are required to participate in one activity around the school. I think that is is a great idea for Middle and Elementary school! But some of the students don't like the idea as much. I agree with my principal's decision to require at least one extracurricularÂ activity. Whether it's encouraging students to learn something new that they like, getting to know others and making friends, or to spark a new hobby/interest. Here are my reasons and elaboration as to why I think this.\n \n My first reason is that some of your time in Middle School should be spent doing something that you enjoy learning. The Loudoun Times have written about other schools doing the same change as what Mr. Generic_Name just announced. A writer for the Loudoun Times interviewed students at one school and 1 out of 5 students interviewed didn't like the idea at first, but when the interview happened again in the middle of the school year, that ratio changed to 4 out of 5.\n \n Another reason why at least one extra curricular activity is good, is that you get to know others and make friends! CBS reported on a camp that was held in the Summer for exactly one week, which had kids aged 11 to 14 from 10am to 7pm, with 23 kids total, and activities of hiking, four square, camping, and more. All of the students except one had reported making at least one friends that they, later on in the camp, gave contact information to. I know this isn't in a school setting, but this proves that students can be the same way when doing a fun activity that they signed up for. If you like Tennis for example, you can play with other people in Tennis that share the same interest.\n \n The last sentence brings me to my next reason, which is sparking a new hobby/interest. The University of Virginia had 20 8th graders choose something new to learn. The options were, Guitar, Tennis, and Basketball. 16 out of 20 8th graders liked what they chose. The next day, having all of the 20 8th graders either choose something new, or choose something different, 13 out of 20 choose the same option that they chose yesterday. One student when interviewed, said that he liked Guitar and hoped he could learn more about it in the future. That one student probably now has a new interest of Guitar as well as the other students who chose their activity for both of the two days. The people who chose the activity for only one day at least have an idea of what isn't for them.\n \n I have just told you my reasoning! My 3 reasons have now told you why I support Mr. Generic_Name's decision of requiring at least one extracurricularÂ activity. Making friends, getting to know other people, sparking a new interest, and having people choose something that they just want to see if it's for them. At least one of these reasons can help students when choosing their activity and make them feel better. Mr. Generic_Name clearly made the best choice for our school.",

      essay:
        "Did you know schools in your area have decided all students must participate in at least one after school activity? Incredible news if you ask me. Being involved in extracurricular activitys has shown to have amazing results on young growing minds. They're good for your overall health, they improve your skill sets and have a helpful impact on schools.\n \n Firstly, Being required to do a type of interactive activitly are not only expressive and fun but improve you mental and physical health. For example when playing a sport you practice getting stronger, improving your active ability and are getting in shape. You gain muscle and strength throughout your body. Your running gets much cleaner and your breathing gets more controlled. When I was really serious about my dancing skills I noticed a huge build up of leg muscle. Through out the years I've gotten alot stronger in my core and arms. Mentaly being active can take your mind of off hard times in your life. If you had a bad day at school or haven't been feeling your best, being active can make you feel alot more calm and have less anxiety. It takes you to a safe place. Every child should have access to something like that and the fact that not all kids do needs to change. Personally when I get in a fight with my parents I like to go for a run outside or play vollyball with my friends. I always end up feeling happier. Sports can also allow students release any anger or upset feelings they have. Some kids struggle with mentle health issues and don't all have resources to help. Playing a sport or being active can allow you to get ride of the upset feelings in a healthy way that won't harm anyone. I notice this can be a way to cope. It's okay to be angry but it's not okay to take your anger out on others or cause harm. There's also many ways after school activties can improve your different skill sets, here's some examples in the following.\n \n Secondly, extracurricular activitys helps improve your different emotinal skills. You learn to be more dedicated. When you playa sport or apart of a club you're on a team and you need to be there for one another. When you miss a practice you're not only letting yourself down but you're letting your team down too. When someone misses a practice on my dance team it's hard for all of us. We have reblock dances or fill in peeple who arn't there. It's more work for us which is unfair. You also learn to be more motivated. You start to set goals for yourself and strive to achive those goals. It can work with your school and home life too. Motivation can also make you more confident and work harder to be successful. I used to struggle with feeling motivated but when I stared dancing I found a strive for working as hard as I can to get better. It can be stressful but it's worth it. Dedication is also a skill that is getting worked on. Being dedicatied is always doing your best no matter how easy something is. Dedication is found when you try your best and go above what is required. If your apart of a yearbook club you learn to stay dedicated to finish the book and make it look as good as it can. You don't give up when it gets too hard. Your school does alot for you and you should always give back to what you get in return.\n \n Lastly, participating in after school activities helps improve you school. When being apart of sports your school provides, that's a way of donating money. You have to pay for things when you're apart of a team ( outfits, games ect). When giving money to your school it helps pay for field trips, better lunches, classroom design and lots more. My old school was able to have amazing field trips because we saved money from donations. Some after school activites can include art clubs, design groups and student council. We could make groups that help clean up trash around the school, let kids get creative and have art work around the school and create new ways students can express themselves and help others. The student council could be in charge of these groups and ensure work was being done. Finally after school groups and activites can help teachers and staff. School's are very dirty and it's a lot of work for only a few staff memebers to have to clean. Cleaning clubs could be a great way students can give back to our school. We could clean the floors, windows and bathrooms. Competive sports teams are a way to get our schools name out there so people pick going to our school rather than any others. If we have good sports teams that win parents will notice that and could end up sending their kids to our school. I have many friends that have moved schools to have better luck in getting into collage through good sports teams at their schools.\n \n In conclusion, schools requiring all students to endore one after school activity not only shows they care but improves your health, adds to your skill sets and is very helpful for your school and making it a better place. Students may not be as joyful in the begging but will soon notice a huge postive change and outlook towards school everyday. What is your take on this topic ?",

        "Have you ever participated in an activity where you either loved or hated it? Well, believe it or not, I think that all extracurricular activities should be appreciated. Extracurricular activities are activities used to equip you with new skills that you may not have had before, not used to only have fun and learn nothing from it just because your parents forced you to do it. They are there for a reason, and should be taken advantage of. I agree with the decision of the principal for making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity for three reasons: it gives you the opportunity to learn a life lesson, it can improve your academic performance, and gives you a chance to make new friends.\n \n The opportunity given to you to learn a life lesson can be rare. To learn a life lesson means to realize that this world we live in, isn't fair nor perfect. There will be times where you wish certain things had happened to make life better for you, but that just simply can't happen. Participating in an extracurricular activity can create memories and meaningful experiences that you can't experience anywhere else. It can also help with being disciplined, and can give you something to live for. That is why I think that taking part in an extracurricular activity can be life-changing.\n \n The act of participating in an extracurricular activity can even improve your academic performance. Depending on the activity, it can motivate students to do better if a certain activity requires you to have good grades in school. Participation in these activities can relieve stress, and looks good on your resume for college applications. Experiences from the activity can be stored up in your brain to be used as background knowledge in the future. Those reasons tie into the fact that taking part in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory.\n \n A chance to make new friends is always exciting for everyone. Making new friends also means making new relationships with the people you care about. Having people that you care for, rather than having random strangers around you, doesn't give you a sense of loneliness. It brightens you up like the sunrise, when you see the first beam of light. Making new friends especially while participating in an extracurricular activity makes it more fun, and amusing. It gives you an electric shock of joy, making you excited to come back again the next time. That is why I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity would be beneficial.\n \n Many people say that students should have a choice whether or not they would like to participate in an extracurricular activity, but I believe that it should be more of the opposite. The opportunity to learn a life lesson, improve your academic performance, and make new friends are the three reasons why I think that students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Therefore, when you meet a student that currently doesn't participate in an extracurricular activity, invite them to join you, or find an activity that you think they would enjoy. This would be a great opportunity for everyone because they would be able to relieve their stress, do something that they love to do, and would enjoy every second of the activity, spending time with the ones they care about the most. Overall, I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of all the benefits, and the giant footprint that it would leave on this planet.",

I disagree with this decision because some students do not have time after school, don't have the transportation afterwards, or not interested.\n \n With this added, where will they find the time for their home life?\n \n First, I disagree because some students have a job after school. Some students have to work that job to help support, so having this added would just add to their stressful life. Second, some students have to help their familiesÂ withÂ things such as chores, make dinner, etc. If they have to stay at school longer, some of those important things wouldn't get done.

For Example if I am suffering from depression it gives me the chance to do something that would take my mind away from the depression. Another reason would be if you have anxiety you can play or choose an activity that relaxes you and just lets you escape from all the anxiety around you. One major point is working better with other people. Extracurricular Activities can help you as a learner work better with others. For Example my Granddad is in the Construction business and when you have jobs like that and teaching and pretty much any job you have to know how to collaborate with other people. This brings me to my final point Extracurricular Activities can help your Social Skills.\n \n These Activities can help with Social Activity as well. Like for example it give people who might not have friends or the best of friends a chance to make new ones whether it is through Sports or another type of Club. Another reason is because it gives you the opportunity to get closer and create a bond with friends and maybe even family. Plus there are many different clubs to choose from. These activities can help you stay fit and healthy as well. It also gives you the opening to meet new teachers and coaches that you might be able to start a bond with.\n \n There are many different options to choose from. If you like sports you could play football or basketball or even soccer or baseball. If you like to test your brain power you can join chess or checkers club. And last but not least if you like to speak in front of people public speaking. This is one of my classes that I strongly encourage people to take to help with speaking in the workplace. Art is another option if you like being creative.\n \n So my conclusion is choosing an Extracurricular Activity is important especially in High School and College.",

These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren\'t up to par to look like ""pretty"" people they can get sad and form some type of depression.\n \n Overall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity\'s to the students day can help with that. building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you\'ll atleast know some key factors to living. Building social skills is great too. Lets say you get a job in marketing, you need to be social, have great speech, and be outgoing. In fact, you need social skills for any job. The principle making the desicion to add an extracurricular activity\'s to students day at school was and great idea.\n \n In conclusion, adding an extracurricular activity to all of the student body would be an great idea because, it could be benifial to students, parents. and teachers. Building social skills. Life skills, and just being productive has all to do with adding an extracurricular activity to a students day. I think i have stated what my opinion is and what i agree and disagree with. What my opinion is, is that the principle making that desicion is wise and thoughtful.',

        "The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These extracurricular activities include sports, student council, work on the yearbook, and other activities. This will force students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. I disagree with this requirement, for it can be stressful, it forces the students who dislike these activities to participate, and it takes away time for their other responsibilities.\n \n First, students might find extracurricular activities stressful. Students who dislike having to work with others are forced into an uncomfortable situation when they are forced to participate in extracurricular activities along with other students. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and some students may not be able to because they have responsibilities at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of homework and other responsibilities at home.\n \n Then, their grades may drop. If a student is required to leave class for their extracurricular activity while doing something important in class like notes then their grade may drop because they missed that work. Students may have work for an extracurricular activity and that work may pile up with work from their other classes. For example, My friend Generic_Name does student council and we were taking notes in class when they made an announcement for all student council members to meet in the library and Generic_Name ended up missing all of the notes for the test the next day.\n \n Also, students may have other responsibilities at home. Students my have responsibilities at home like walking their dog, cleaning the dishes, doing laundry, and other responsibilities. Some extracurricular activities require you to stay after school and that takes away the time for the responsibilities the have at home. For example, I have to go home and clean after school and if I am staying after school I will not have the chance to clean because of my homework and other responsibilities at home.\n \n However, students may enjoy extracurricular activities. Students may choose to participate in extracurricular activities, for it can be a way to have fun, you get to spend time with friends, and it gives you a time away from all of the stressful school work. For example, I do not get to spend time with friends during class because we are working and extracurricular activities can be a way for me to see friends and have fun. That is why some students may choose to participate in these extracurricular activities.\n \n In conclusion, Students who are forced to participate in after school activities may lose time for school work, responsibilities, and personal time. When a student is forced into an activity that they dislike it they might slack off and that can distract other students who care about their activity from thier work. Students should have a choice of what they do during and after school because it can affect their attitude towards their school work. That is why I disagree with the principal's requirement.",

        "Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.\n \n Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school because it can help you make new friends, help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity, and can improve your skills on specific things. If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people, but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy because most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured.\n \n Being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that. Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.\n \n Generic_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. When he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high schoolÂ and was really looking forward to it.",

        "Today was a long day at school wasn't it? You did a lot of work. Studied hard. Maybe you even spent two blocks typing an essay for your SOL. Wouldn't it be nice to take a break and do something you enjoy? I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n \n To start, activities can help kids make new friends and socialize. An article published by NOVA stated that \"\"87% of students that participate in after schoolÂ activitiesÂ make a friend that they previously weren't friends with.\"\" That's a large number. Based on the study, students make friends more frequently when they are in the same club or activity as someone with the same interest as you. I think that making new friends and having fun in an activity is something everyone should experience. In the same article, it states that \"\"kids that share the same interest tend to develop a stronger friendship than kids with opposite interest and personalities.\"\" The easiest way to find someone that shares interest with you is to go to a club or activity. You'll meet people with the same liking as you. I actually met my best friend at a extracurricular activity. We were both in the same club, meaning we share somewhat of the same interest, so we started talking more, and we became best friends.\n \n Another reason is, kids can take a break from school and relax for a while. A study done by the Virginia Health Department shows that \"\"the average kids aged 11 and older that play a sport or do an activity they love, have their stress level decreased by up to 67%. It can also help clear their mind from all the bad and corruption going on around them.\"\" When I play basketball, everything that I'm thinking about clears and I stay focused on the game. At that point, I know longer feel stressed or worried about anything going on around me. I think that's always a good thing to do. Just have fun and relax. Don't be stressed or worried about anything. Just enjoy yourself. Another article by Richard Sampson, writer for the Washington Post, stated that \"\"playing a sport or participating in an activity showed to be just as effective, if not more effective than meditation. It clears and calms the brain and body while having fun and enjoying oneself.\"\" Having fun, and being stress free? That sounds like a win-win situation to me. I think it's a great thing to do. You lose stress and have fun. Why wouldn't you want to do an extracurricular activity?\n \n On the other hand, students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity if the don't want to. A study done by the LoudounÂ County Public Activities Club (LCPAC) showed that students that were forced to sign up for and activity didn't have fun or enjoy them self. I don't think that making someone sign up for an activity is a good idea because they won't have fun. However, it's always good to try something new. If they don't like the activity they signed up for, then they don't have to do it next time. Try something else. Activities are supposed to be a fun, enjoyable time.\n \n To bring it all together, extracurricular activities should be something all students do. It brings fun, joy, new friends, and takes away stress and anxiety. That sounds like a great opportunity to me. Contact your principal at school. Get activities started at your school. Or, sign up for one outside of school. Trust me, you will love it!",

        "I feel as if everybody should be in a club or on a sports team or at least just engaging themselves with something else instead of regular old school. I agree with my principal with making it so students have to participate in a least one extracurricular activity because, everybody needs something to do outside of school. You can join a club and meet new friends and new people, you can find things that you like to do that you never even knew you liked.\n \n Every kid needs to be doing outside of school, i heavily suggest sports for kids, more importantly a team sport. Being on a team sport teaches you how to be a leader and a team player. At the same time you are getting great exercise that your body needs. Kids need to be kids and having them play sports is a great way to let them go and be kids. You learn a lotÂ of valuableÂ life lessons when you play a sport, some that might stick with you your whole life. Also kids doing something like playing sports or volunteering somewhere can help from get kids off the streets getting involved with drugs and committing crimes.\n \n Besides sports and doing things outside of school, another great way to get into and extracurricular activity is joining a club. Joining a club could be beneficial for someone who has a hard time making new friends. If you join a club you might find yourself interested in something you never even knew that you liked. Say you have a hard time making new friends, if you join a clubs that has to do with something that you really like you are bound to find some new friends because you are surrounding yourself with other people who have the same interests that you do. Also more schools should have more variety of clubs and things to do after school to make school a more enjoyable place.\n \n Another great thing about participating in extracurricular activities is that you can find new hobbies that you like that you never even heard of or that you've never tried. If your not sure if you should join that club or play that sport just do it, because if you don't and you realize what could've been a good experience is thrown away because you did notÂ want to try anything new. It's okay to step out of your comfortÂ zone every now and then. It may be fun or it may not, you just got to find yourself and what you like, experimenting with things is great for you. Don't second guess yourself, the more you second guess the more your talking yourself out of doing it.\n \n InÂ conclusionÂ it should be schools jobs to make sure kids are putting themselves in clubs and sports etc. to succeed and have a better life. I highly agree with my principle making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity inside and outside of school, my principle needs a raise. Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Have you ever wanted to do something but where to lazy to do it? I agree with Making kids participate in an extracurricular activity because it would fix this problem by making kids participate. One reason why Being forced to participate in an extra curricular activity could benefit these kids is because it could make them more have more hobbies and goals. The next reason why making them participate in extracurricular activities would be good for them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and become successful of them. Another reason why forcing them to participate would be good is because It could allow them to develop better social skills and become a better person.\n \n One reason why forcing them to do activities would benefit them is how they could develop new hobbies and goals. For example, when I started swimming my parents forced me to go to practice even when I didÂ notÂ want to. Now I am a competitive swimmer and enjoy going to practice because I have goals that I want to accomplish. This example shows how making someone participate in something can sometimes benefit them by giving them new hobbies and goals. Another example is when my parents signed me up for the river hawkÂ running program at my school and I did not enjoy running. But now I have made running one of my hobbiesÂ and I will try out for my high schoolsÂ cross countryÂ team. This example shows how I was being forced Into running and started out not liking it but now I do. These examples show how being forced into doing something can benefit you by giving you goals and a chance to pursue something.\n \n The next reason why I think making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them is because they can find new activities that they enjoy and then become successful in them. An example is how my parents forced me to swim and now I will be on TVÂ swimming in Florida at the national level for my age group. This example shows how I was successful and because I was forced to be a swimmer I made it on TV. Another example is how my mom forces me to go to school and I have become a successful student and have been getting all A grades. Another example of how making students participate in an extracurricular activity could make them more successful Is how my brother became a successfulÂ piano player. My parents made him start taking Piano lessons and now he has become great at Piano and may try to become are school Piano player. This example shows how my brother became successful by my parents making him start piano. All of these examples show how It would be good for the principle to make the students participate in an activity because it would make them a more successful person.\n \n Another reason why making students participate in an extracurricular activity could benefit them Is how they could develop better social skills and become a better person. An example of this is when I was in fourthÂ grade and I did not like to talk to people. But when my parents signed me up for a activity after school that would help go around helping people and do food drives I became involved with the program and started to talk to people finding ways to help others. This example shows how I developed better social skills and I became a better person by helping others. Another example of how extracurricular activities help develop myÂ social skills is when I joined my first Triathlon team I had work hard to keep up with my team and cheer for other teammates. This example shows how I was using social skills to cheer for my teammates and why extracurricular activities could benefit students.\n \n I agree with Making students do extracurricular activities. One reason why I think making kids do extracurricular activities would be a good Idea Is because they can develop new hobbies and make goals for themselves to achieve. Another reason why I think they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity is because they could find new activities that they enjoy and become successful in them.

        "Should all students be required to do an extracurricular activity? Yes, I do agree that all students should do some form of activity. There are many types of after school activities that students can participate in, including clubs, sports, debate teams, and so much more. I myself have done so many extracurricular activities. So many I couldn't count them all. I do believe that all students should do a extracurricular activity because, it can improve friendships and social interaction, encourage good exercise and motivation in work, study, and nutrition habits, and make it easier for students with health problems to interact with other kids their age and feel involved.\n \n Friends are very important in our lives. When were kids mostly everyone finds that one person who you can laugh with, make jokes with, have your own secret language, and just be kids! If you ever had that one person, think back to how you met them. Did you just bump into themÂ going down the street and all of a sudden ya'll were best friends? That might be a slight possibility but fighting the odds you most likely met your childhood best friend by doing something that you like to do. Thats right an activity! Children need best friendsÂ and whether they try out for the football team or join the debate team, I do believe that you will find a new best friend.\n \n Although friends and a very important thingÂ in a stable childhood, exercise and motivation has just as much as a positive or negative consequence on your life. Motivation is a enormous thing that can push you to do anything that you want to do. Joining teams and clubs will not only make you friends but give you peers and trusted adults that will be right behind you for whatever you choose to do. Motivation is also the key to exercise. exercising as a kid will keep you a happy and healthy person for years to come. As the years do come youll find yourself in great habits, keeping yourself healthy. Healthy habits are not the only thing. Its proven that the happier and healthier you are the more you may put into your life. If you just sit on the couch all day not doing anything, your not going anywhere with your life.Â Good exercise and good motivation are very important things and inheriting those traits just from joining a sport or club, is a huge win.\n \n Now lets talk about the children who are physical and mentally challenged. Yes, they might not have the same mindset as you and me, or can't move some part of their body, but that does notÂ mean that they shouldnt have just as much as a chance as you and me. I think incouringing special education students to enjoy the wonders of childhood are just as important as it was for everyone else in the world. When you involve these children, at that second they won't see that their different, they will see thatÂ their with kids their age having fun. Because their kids, they should have equal opportunities as other kids. Let them joinÂ that sports team if they are willing to do and and have their mind set on what they want to do. Who is to stop them?\n \n As more and more children start to do extracurricular activities more and more will follow. So Yes, I do believe that children should be pushed to do extracurricular activities, because if they dont, they might have just given up a huge part of their childhood that they might never get back. As you get older you might still have that best friendÂ still sticking around, or you might still have those study habits and healthy habits, or you might have had been a person that decided to be such a kind person and have that special education kid join your friend group as because you knew everyone needs a friend. No matter what it is, all their is to know is that you gained something so positive that will be stuck with you for decades.Â Â",

Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead.

This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study.

We should get to decide our own path not the principal.\n \n Most kids already do extracurricular activities. They help us make new friends, us can get better, and you could be really good and get scholarships. Some kids can't afford extracurricular activities as their is usually a joining fee or yearly fee to be in the club. Kids do extracurricular activities because they look good on college resume, but some kids don't want to go to college.

Then an hour of homework and eating dinner and it is already seven and they have had no family time yet. Their parents might also work multiple jobs to make just enough money to scrape by, so their parents might not even be home.

Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricularÂ activity because it helps with college prep, helps with stress, and doesn'tÂ take much time.\n \n Working on a extracurricular can helps you prepare for college. When you send in your college application they not only look a grades but what you bring to the table. If you play football they might want you for there football team or if you play in band they might want you for there school band. Colleges also give out scholarships for certain activities. If you were good enough at your extracurricular you may even qualify for financial help to pay for college.

Colleges look at these kinds of things its important to be prepared and accomplished.\n \n Taking a break in the middle of the day and going to a fun class that you choose can really help with stress. It lets you take a break between your academic classes. You some times end up sitting for hours doing math,science, and reading you can become tired and stop focusing.

If changing that means you waste a half a hour to just run around or talk then so be it.\n \n Some my look at these classes and say they are a waste of time and a distraction from the important classes but the also help in the long run.\n \n Students need to take a break and join a class they enjoy it will help them with college prep, although them to take a break, and is a good use of there time. There are many benifits to allowing your self time to work on personal goals and make time for yourself\n \n It doesnt need to be a largeÂ amount of time or the most acidemic class it just needs to be a class that you enjoy.Â",

        "One Club\n \n Parents and other people think it is good to have extracurricular activity for kids. People say that it helps kids interact with other kids. People also say that it takes time away from them going on their phone. I also agree that every kid should have to take one. You are not taking five or six it is just one. I think this would be a great thing to do. It would help kids find, or improve there hobbies. A hobby is some thing you like to do. Hobbies are cool and there are a lot of your hobbies at school in the from of after school activity. They even can fit the your week. You can even find friends that like the same thing you do. There are clubs that are just certain grades.\n \n Clubs are on every day of the week. Like how on Mondays kids go to running club, or on Thursday kids go to drama club. Kids do all sorts of cool clubs. Clubs are made to be on all sort of days Monday, Tuesday, Wensday, Thursday, and Friday. There are a bunch of clubs here are some. You have running club, drama, lacrosse, chess, girl scouts, yearbook, vex, knitting, battle of the books. You see that is just some of them. Maybe you should try one?\n \n There other good thing about having extracurricular activity. Maybe you will meet someone that likes what you like, and you guys or girls will be friends. You could also have a better relationship with the teacher who teaches the club. I could see you thinking but if there are little kids, and they can be a little annoying. If you ask but what if the older kids run me over. Then there is a place for you because there are clubs that are just older or younger kids.\n \n I think it would be great to have every person to do one extracurricular activity. There are many factors that they are good. Like they can fit your week, there are a lotÂ of club to pick from, meet new friends,and last but not least there are age clubs too.",

        "Instead of having the same boring schedule every day of going to school, home, repeat, imagine being able to dress up for home games with your sports team, or hanging out with friends after schoolÂ to work on the plans for the yearbook! Adding the rule that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity would be a fantastic way to make sure that students are getting involved with their school. There are so many choices for everyone in the school. From sports, to crafting, Future Business Leaders, and many more, students are sure to find something that they enjoy. Doing extracurricular activities can help make friends, keep you active, and form a second family away from home. It can also help you later in life with time management skills, and help keep your grades up.\n \n A benefit that comes with joining a team, club, or organization with other people is making friends. It's hard to make friends at school because of constant changing classes and so many people split up. Especially when it comes to sports, you can form a second family. Being on a team, you know that people have your back during a game. After being involved with the same group of people, you start to form a bond that makes everyone so close. Having an outlet with people that you know, and are close to, can really have a positive impact on you're life.\n \n Later on in life, students will remember the work that they put in, and remember the friendships that they made. The habits of time management that come with being a part of multiple things at one time will stick with them. This includes having to wake up early to go to a practice, or meeting. Also being organized and prepared is a big part of the responsibilitiesÂ that come with joining a group. To be allowed to be in extracurricular activities, you must be a student in good standing. Which means you need to be passing all your classes in order to do anything before of after school. This rule makes students strive to have better grades so that they are able to participate.\n \n There are mostly benefits when it comes to having this addition to the schools policy, it would be a very smart thing to put in place. From making new friends, to doing better in school and later on in life, the schools fresh and more positive environment will be full of hardworking and high striving students. The involvement in organizations has a lot bigger of an impact than you think.",

Some students might not have transportation to pick them up from the activity after school. Some students just want to go home and relax after school. The school should just let the students choose what they want to do instead of forcing them to do it. I disagree with this decision because not all students have transportation from the activities, not all students have the energy to do something after school, and there is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities.\n \n Not all students have transportation from the extracurricular activity. Some students' parents work all day and don't have the time to pick their child up from those activities. Most kids just ride the bus home because their parents are still working when school ends. For example, lets say that there is a students that normally rides the bus home. If that student's parents work until seven o'clock at night, than the bus is that student's only transportation home.\n \n Not all students have the energy after school to do any other activities. Some students might not get enough sleep at night and are tired throughout the school day. Maybe some students have a young sibling that they have to help take care of. That could cause them to have less energy than normal. Some students skip breakfast, which causes them to have less energy during the day too.\n \n There is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities. For example we have enough for all the sports teams to have a full team. Not only do we have enough, but those students want to do those activities and haven't been forced to do it.

Extracurricular activities should be required in schools because they help students release stress, help thinking in a new way, and makes school enthralling to those who have not been blessed with natural intelligence. Extracurricular activities can improve many students lifestyles.\n \n A long day of tiring work builds up unnecessary stress. Students are packed with homework in subjects they may not enjoy. To end their day with an activity they enjoy can make a horrific day into an enthralling experience; for example, majority of people like spending time with others who they have things in common with. Growing up, it was hard for me to socialize, it felt as if everyone elseÂ was functioning faster than Ic was. After a day that felt as if the human population was filled with nothing but sorrow, I finally got to go home and feel the crystal clear water cool my body down, as my team practiced steadily for our swim competition. To have a kid feel relaxed and at peace will improve what they think as they wake up on Monday mornings.\n \n In the school I have attended for junior high, I am required to take classes that focus on music. In the sixth grade, I chose orchestra because it was an amusing experience to see how one movement in my wrist could cause a pleasant noise to be heard throughout the room. In my science class, we had moved on to the sound unit and i excelled while many other students did not. When my science teacher used words such as octaves, pitch, and harmony it wasn't difficult to understand. The extracurricular activities I have taken have opened my mind into a more creative way of thinking. They taught me that there is more meaning on a paper than what is written in ink.\n \n One of the many symptoms of depression is memory loss. Since my mother had suffered from the illness, it was genetically passed down to me. Even as a child it was clear to me that school was mainly about memorization. When teachers talked about how we had learned topics in prior years my brain scattered through the many memories in my head but was unable to remember anything. Extracurricular activities aren't about your ability to memorize, but your motivation to excel. That's why it will help students who are more academically challenged would more likely enjoy these activities.\n \n Activities a student enjoys can introduce them to experiences they didn't know were possible. Extracurricular activities help students release stress from the hardships of their day, show them a way to think that they haven't seen before, and is beneficial for those who believe they are not intelligent.

This may be good for other students but not everyone has the time for extracurricular activities. Many students have things to do at home and extracurricular could be stopping them from doing them.\n \n Extracurricular activities take time away from students being with their family's, it would also take time away from activities outside of school like a sport they play or something that they participate in. Extracurricular would make students have no time to do there homework or finish any work that they need to do. Many students don't focus on extracurricular and they want to get a good grade. But extracurricular might make them not have much time to study or finish there work. And sometimes students just don't want to do any extracurricular activities.\n \n If a student does not want to do a activity than they should'ent do it. And if all students have to do extracurricular than it would get to crowded and people will lose more interest in what they like to do as a extracurricular activities.

This is because the activities can provide students with life long important tools. For the benefit of the students, I believe that kids should be pushed to participate in extracurricular actives. I believe this willÂ benefits the students in a variety of ways that include making new friends, being more productive, and allowing for more success in life.\n \n One of the main reasons that making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be beneficial to students is the fact those activities allow for new friendships to be created. This is true because most extracurricularÂ activities allow students to talk with each other, andÂ talking with a person is the first step towards friendship. One of the biggest issues facing teenagers isÂ depression, but if they had a place thatÂ madeÂ them feel comfortable that would help. An extracurricular activity would be perfect to make them feel like they belong. Those friends would also most likely stay with them their entire lives.\n \n A second reason making kids participate in extracurricular activities would be helpful is it could allow them to be more productive. This is because most extracurricular activities are only open for a small amount of time after-school, for anything fun to be accomplished they would have to be productive. Some activities like working on the yearbook,Â and student council have deadlines, which can teach students how or why to be productive in school. Teaching students about deadlines can also go in their future by preparing them for a college or a job.\n \n The third main reason that making students participate in extracurricular activities is positive is it allows them to feel successful. It is important for them to feel successful because they will strive to be successful in other aspects of their lives allowing for more success that can alsoÂ help them in the long term. One being if they join a good club then they can place that on their resume for college, allowing them to get a good job. On the contrary, if they didn't want to or couldn't afford college the club could go right on their resumeÂ in order for them to join the work force.\n \n In conclusion, we should make students participate in extracurricular activities for many reasons, but the three most prominent being it will give them the chance to make friends, teach them about productivity, and will allow for success even after school has ended for them. Extracurricular activities allow for a students to create meaningful lasting friendships. They also allow for students toÂ learn the importance of productivity for the future.

Sports also keep you in good shape by exercises, running and conditioning drills. Also for sports you sometimes have to be fit and well put together so if your not your not making the team.\n \n They are also fun, because for yearbook on school spirit days you get to be out of class taking pictures for people with school spirit.

I definetly don't support the principles decision of making it a requirement for students to participate in an activity.\n \n Some parents make their kids run errands, doing so may lead them to not be able to participate. They might have younger siblings they have to watch over which makes it hard as well. Students of extra assistance might not be able to do the activities. As the year will go by, studies will get more advanced. Students might get stressed, with the activity on their hands they might get more stressed. I know how it feels to be stressed and overwhelmed as a student, things are harder to get done with being pressured. People have different things going on in their lives, it might be hard for them to go to school if there family are not in their llife as much. They could live far away from the school and have no tranportation for school or attending their own game practices.\n \n I think they should require only what is mandatory to pass the current grade students are in. Sport, running for student council, or participating in a school related event should be optional. Some people don't like participating in sports and all these other things, it just might not be their thing. Parents might wanna put their kids in tutoring after school because of their grades, but unfortunatly they can't because they got game practice or school duties. All of these problems caused by the principles decision will lead to students transferring to another school.

We can talk the principle out of this, make students happy, and parents proud again! The parents and students lives wont be so stressful anymore.\n \n Finally, that is why i reject having to participate in an school activity. I want to study stress free and have my life at ease. Students should participate in school activities only if they want to. They shouldn't be forced to if it's not required.

        "According to Dr. Maxwell Olchena, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains, participating in marching band can do one of two things depending on your personality, just wait until you see what his studies have proven! I think it's very important to do an extra curricular activity, but I do not believe it should be required, as we just do not have enough options for extra circulars to fit every student's desires. Some extra circulars, such as marching band, are not for the light of heart and truly are scary at points(especially drum line but we'll get into that later.) This is why students should do extra circulars, but it should not be a requirement.\n \n Dr. Maxwell Olchena is a psychologist who has been studying the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains for almost 20 years, here's what his studies have shown: there are two things marching band can do to the brain of an adolescent, and however they are affected depends on their personality and nothing to do with IQ(Intelligence quota). Those with higher IQs tend to perform better in marching band, although marching band does not require you perform well(as hard work brings good performance.) The two things that can happen to the brain of an adolescent when they join marching band are, increased mood and productiveness, or decreased mood and productiveness, thats right. Marching band can do two polar opposite things to the adolescent brain. Dr. Olchena's studies have shown that when someone considered an extrovert joins marching band, their mood will decrease and they will become burnt out, this is because they aren't used to the amount of work put into their social life. Marching band is less a sport and more of a social activity, unless you are willing to accept it as your only family, you will not be happy and become very burnt out. Here's where Olchena's studies get crazy, introvertsÂ are more likely to have increased moods and increased productiveness when joining marching band. Olchena's studies have also shown that when and introvert joins marching band, they become more social, and those around them report and increase in socializing. Now here's where this relates to every extra curricular, Olchena had his friend, and fellow psychologist, Dr. Alan Russell study this in his area of study, debate team, and the exact opposite is true for this extra curricular. Introverts tend to lose productiveness and have a decrease in happiness, whereas extroverts tend to have increased productiveness and mood.\n \n Drum line, however, is where the studies get interesting. Dr. Brock Hayman, an expert in the effects of drum line on the adolescent brain, has discovered a new area of the brain that awakens the second you join drum line. This area is called the DrumbolowÂ Cortex. When activated, this area of the brain never turns off. The DrumbolowÂ Cortex does some weird things to the brain once activated, it can cause the person to do crazy things, such as picking up gum on the ground of the parking lot at band camp(This has actually happened before.) Other signs that this area has been activated are: inability to stop drumming, addiction to buying drumsticks, need to move up rankings in drumlins, and recruiting more people for the drum line. studies show that 90% of people do not even have this area in their brain, and fewer than 5% of the population has it activated.\n \n These are all good reasons why you should join an extracurricular(*cough cough drum lineÂ cough cough*,) so why shouldn't it be a requirement? Dr. Brett Staudt, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on people's actions around family members, has the answer to your question. \"\"Those who chose to join marching band will become a disturbance to their family, they will become obsessed with showing their family shows by Drum Corps International, such as the Cavaliers 2011 show in which the drums are upside down. Most of the population does not care whatsoever about how amazingly cool it is to drum upside down, but any person who chooses to join marching band, even if they don't do drum line, will become obsessed with the fact that people have enough skill to play the tenors upside down.\"\" This quote says two things, you should watch the Cavaliers 2011 show, and also that marching band has negative effects on the life of family members of the person who chooses this curse/blessing of an activity, not to mention, you'll never see that person again because they'll always be at practice or hanging out with their marching band friends.\n \n Although I do believe it is a good idea to do an extra curricular, Dr. Nathan Strain has done countless studies on forcing adolescents to partake in things, and it causes them to be less interested in what they're doing. I would rather not have people in marching band who are there only because they've been forced to be there, as they will not work as hard because all they care about is the fact that they have to do it. When students have free will and the ability to make their own decision, they will choose what they feel is best for them selfÂ and we should let them do whatever they believe is best for their situation in life at the moment. You never know what else a student has to do at home just to have enough money for food, or to pay for other expenses.\n \n What I take away from this evidence is that we should not force students to participate in extra curricular, but rather encourage them to do so. Personally, joining drum line was the best choice(I'm kidding it was a mistake but I'm glad I made it) I've ever made and I will continue doing drum line for the rest of my high school and college career, although had I been forced, I'm not sure if I'd be as happy to be in it. I genuinely think forcing students to do anything will cause burnout and decrease happiness. I truly think students should make their own decision on if an extra curricular fits in their life or not.

        "There are many different types of people at school. There are athletes, creative, hard-working, and many others. If they were told that they had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school, I think there would be multiple opinions about it. I think that students should not be forced into doing a school activity for three reasons. Their time, their effort, and their stress.\n \n The first reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples time/schedule. If someone for example, would choose sports and the sports practices were after after school. If they didn't have the time to practice from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. or couldn't practice form 5:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. then it would be a pretty rough schedule. Another example is when I was playing basketball for my Middle School team. We had practice everyday and it was very tiring. Some people might just want to go home and sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv instead of doing a activity. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of time.\n \n The second reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples effort. Some people might not like any of the options that the school offers so they might not put all their effort into whatever activity they pick. For example, if a very creative and artistic person looks at all of the options and they are all sport related they will not really care what they pick because that is not what they really like to do. Another example is when my cousins and I went to a arts and crafts place where you could build or draw anything you could imagine. I didn't put as much effort as some as my cousins because arts and crafts is not mt favorite thing to do. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of effort.\n \n Lastly, I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of stress. Some people can get stressed out very easily when they have to do something new or there is a lot to do. For example, if someone was taking all of the most advanced classes you could take and then they had to choose something else to worry about could make a lot of stress. They would have a lot because of how much stuff they would have to worry about. Another example is when I was playing basketball and trying to study for 3 tests I had the next day. It was a lot of stress and made me get headaches because I was focused on too much. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of stress.\n \n I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of three reasons. Their time and how it can make your schedule crazy. Their effort and how much a person likes the options or not. And lastly their stress and how it can make your life have to much to handle.Â Â",

        'GOALLLLLL!!!!\n \n Whether it\'s playing sports, participating in student council, school plays, or just painting in art club, all teens and students need that extra confidence, and adrenaline boost that extracurricular activities provide. Principle of Generic_School, Generic_Name, is proposing a new, controversial school rule that states, ""All students at BRMS\n \n must participate in at least one extracurricular activity throughoutÂ the year."" Should his rule be enforced or shot down? If you were to compare the pros and cons, the answer is yes! Not only will this rule be beneficial to all of the students physical and mental health, but forcing kids to branch out and do extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person.\n \n The first reason why . Generic_Name\'s rule should be enforced is pretty clear. By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not have signed up for on their own, they are forced out of their shell and meet new people who share similar passions. In a pole taken at Southern Utah Middle School, the students were asked approximately how many friends they had and generally how they met. The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, and etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don\'t only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that\'s 7 out of 10! Forming bonds with new people can help with trust and relationship issues and can all be done through simply being forced to branch out and participate in an extracurricular activity at your school.\n \n Another meaningful reason for the students to be forced to enjoy extracurricular activities is because of their mental and physical health. World renown author of several New YorkÂ Times awarded self-help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Steigerwald explains, ""Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too."" Steigerwald is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Engstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. He remembered, ""I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,"" he shuddered, ""Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind."" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after schoolÂ on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle.\n \n Having a clear head spaceÂ has been proven to help with academics, and participating in extracurricular activities has proven to help clear your mind. In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. GPAs in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schoolsÂ around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, ""Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and everyday the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it\'s vital for these college students."" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial.\n \n Although it\'s pretty clear that Generic_Name\'s rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take SOLs and other tests. Do SOLs make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and ""pursuing happiness"" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, ""being happy"". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather then loners, who study, work, and textÂ by themselves. This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier.\n \n In the end, the rule should be passed and all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It will not only be beneficial for their mental health, happiness, and social life, but also for academics and physical activity.Â',

        "If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities can help students with things like building new and helpful experiences, preparing for the future, discovering more about their interests, and socializing with their peers.\n \n Joining a certain group for an extracurricular activity can help you make experiences that can open up different pathways for you in the future. If you ever wanted to pursue a career in a certain field, extracurricular activities that you participate in now can help you prepare for what those might be. For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in a job like graphic design, it could be helpful to join an art club or even yearbook club. When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in. Yearbook club, for example, allows you to design a cover for the school yearbook, which would in turn give you the experience of designing covers. A poll performed by Oxford University has showed that 76% of people who now have jobs in the art field participated in some kind of extracurricular activity at school when they were students to help them learn more about what their future jobs would be like. It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college. Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom. The more activities that you participate in both inside and outside of school, the more qualified you are to go to certain colleges because of your strengths. It helps prepare you for different paths in the future. Participating in extracurricular activities such as clubs and teams can not only help you build experiences for the future, but it can also help you discover what you're passionate about.\n \n If you decided to join in on an activity that you can participate in as an extracurricular, it might help you discover what you enjoy doing.Â At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.\n \n Participating in things like clubs, sports teams, or student council gives students the opportunity to meet new people and branch out.Â When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others. This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people. Most activities like these use team efforts. For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills. Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers. You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities. The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy. Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are. Teammates have to cooperate with each otherÂ and work together in order to accomplish tasks. This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime.Â This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars .\n \n For the reasons that I have provided as well as other ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's encouraged that more students participate in extracurricular activities. There are clearly many ways that it would help improve students' lives. It can help them with their passions, socializing with people who share interests or views, and can help students with making new experiences to assist them in the future. Many schools offer a variety of different activities to join that many of the students already find to be enjoyable. Because of the points made, if my principal ever decided that all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with her decision.",

        "Should all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity? Here are some things that might be helpful to get an answer. Some students might have other work to do from school, students may have other activities after schoolÂ or outside of school, and students might become more stressed from extracurricular activities. Those are some things that might be helpful to answer if students must participate in an extracurricular activity.\n \n First, Students might have other work from school that they have to finish at home or after school. Students might have homework, missing work, or late assignments from school that need to be completed on their own time. If students are not able to finish a certain assignment because of an extracurricular activity, it could possibly lower the students grade. If there is an extra class in school, students will most likely have more homework at the end of the day. Students need to finish other work outside of school.\n \n Second, Students may have other activities after schoolÂ or outside of school. Some students need to stay after school to retake a test, do late or missing work, or even just get extra help from a teacher. Students also need time outside of school to collect community service hours to graduate from high school. Students may have school or non-school related classes at home that they need to take such as a tutor, church/religion classes, etc. So students may need extra time for after schoolÂ or non-school related activities.\n \n Finally, students might become more stressed from another extracurricular activity. If some students have low grades, adding an extracurricular activity might overwhelm the student or stress him or her out. If students have a lot of work to complete, they might rush through everything instead of taking their time and being careful. And lastly, students might not be able to keep up with the extra class or work and their parents might keep pushing them on which will again, stress the student out. So students might become more stressed with an extracurricular activity.\n \n So should students really have to participate in an extracurricular activity? I have come to a conclusion. I disagree because students might have other work from school to do at home, students may have other activities outside of school, and students might become more stressed. Those are the three main reasons why I disagree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity.",

        "I think that this would probably be a good idea. The reason i think this will be a good idea is because the kids have a chance to find there passion if they did not yet already. It may also give the kids a chance to stay active instead of going home and just going on there phones. They can help the school with extra stuff like help making the yearbook. This also can make a student get creative if they want to make there own after school club.\n \n The reason kids have a chance to find there passion is because of the choices that the schools has. If the kid is athletic then the school must have all the sports as a choice and the kid can choice what he likes and if his first pick isnt his favorite he can just choose another sport until he finds the one he likes. Then once he likes it he can join a actual team and get good at it. Or if the school has a actual team for that sport he can tryout and see if he makes the team. If the student likes art they can go the a art class and either work on there art or try to get better and try new art techniques. If the student is into acting or something like that they can do drama class and act in plays and practice there acting skills.\n \n Another reason why i think this is good is because it can keep the kids busy instead of them going home to play on there phones. The students can help the teachers with makingÂ yearbooks andÂ if they are good enough they can also take some pictures of the clubs. They can help make events or even if they can they can try to make a fundraiser. They can help pass out material to the teachers for there clubs like paper or pencils if they need it.

And by putting the club together and also thinking of what other they can do to make other kids join. They have to get an idea on how to make the club interesting and how other kids will like it and want to join. They will have to get all the ideas together and make the club that they want to make.\n \n These are the reasons why i think the principles choice of making a extracurricular activity is a good idea.",

        "What do you think about extracurricular activities? I believe that with amazing extracurricular activitiesÂ can inspire a student to have a new hobby, or learn more about them self. On the other hand, a bad one can make a student want to quit liking the activity and do something else. My principal decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with making students participate in an extracurricular activity because of time, money, and a negative impact on everyone.\n \n The first reason is time. Some students might not have enough time to do an extracurricular activity, which could cause the student to have stress. The teacher might lose passion for what they are teaching because of more students, who are being forced to take an extracurricular activity against their will, coming to their after school activity. If the teacher didn't get an influx of students who were forced to take his class, then the they would not have been worn out as fast, or even at all. This will, over time, slowly wear down the teacher, making the class less enjoyable for everyone. Overall, time will be a large problem with forcing students to do extracurricular activities.\n \n The second reason is money. With more students participating, more supplies need to be bought. There might not be enoughÂ money to pay for all of the things students do in an after school activity. The students might not be able to go on trips because they cost to much. People would also be very unhappy if they have to pay for extracurricular activities that their kid was forced into. In the end, there might not be enough money to pay for all of the extracurricular activities.\n \n The final reason is the negative impact it can have on everyone. The teachers will be very stressed becauseÂ they have many students who don't care about that activity. The students will also have plenty of tension because they now have to stay at school longer, and manage another activity every day. If the students are stressed, the effect is that their grades will drop. In all, it can cause everyone to have more unneeded tension.\n \n In conclusion, I don't think making students participate in an extracurricular activity is a great idea. It could help students become more social, but it can cause more problems than it solves. It wouldn't be good if the students or teachers were unhappy because of the principal making students participate in after school activities.

        "Extracurricular Activities Shouldn't Be Forced\n \n Have you ever been forced to do something you didnt want to do? Did you do the task happily? Most people would say it was not an enjoyable experience. When talking about the topic of extracurricular activities in schools, it is definitely something that shouldn't be mandatory. These things shouldn't be forced because it will result in unhappy and resentful students. Also, students should be able to choose their hobbies, and it is frankly none of the school's business.\n \n If we force students to participate in a list of activities that may not cater to their interests, it is only going to make unhappy students who don't actually put any effort into the thing they are being forced to do. Again, try and think back to a time when you were made to do something you didnt want to do. Something that took time away from things you actually wanted, or even needed to do. You probably didn't do that thing with a whole lot of thought and effort, or at least you didn't do it in a good mood. What's the point of forcing kids to do activities, if they are just going to do it sloppily, with zero effort. No matter how many options a school provides, there will always be kids who don't like any of them.\n \n Even though they may not like any of the options at school, whose to say they don't enjoy something outside of school. For example, what if a student is really passionate about their art? And between their chores and school work, they only get work on it about an hour of their day. Now, because they are forced to play a sport or join a club, they have absolutely no time to work on what brings them joy. This defeats the whole purpose of an extracurricular activity.\n \n Even if everyone was perfectly happy with the activity they have to do, why is it any of the schools business what people do with their free time? A school's job is to give students a safe place to learn, and to provide optional extracurricular activities. It's not a schools job to control so much of a students life, that it's even taking up time outside of school. Schools have no idea what goes on in a student's life, and it is unfair for them to assume everyone just has the time and want to do an additional thing outside of school. If a student wants to participate in something, they will. There is no need to force people to do things they dont want to do.\n \n As you can see, the idea of making an extracurricular activity mandatory has many downsides. So many that it is obviously it is not a good idea. Making people do things they don't want to do has never turned out good. Students need the freedom to make their own choices, and the school should have nothing to do with that. No matter how many benefits, extracurricular activities should never be mandatory.Â",

        "Even though a lot of school aged kids participate in after school activities, there are still a lot who don't. Some of them don't participate because theres nothing they like. There are also some kids that act like since they arent forced to do the activities then they won't ever do them, which may set them back in life. Most activities can be so fun, exciting, and interesting. In addition, there are a lot of benefits to participating in such activities, they keep you active and healthy, makes interact with others, and they can keep you busy. So if the principal was to make kids participate in one after school activity that would be a great and wonderful idea.\n \n People who commit to an activity of some sort can stay active and have a healthier mindset compared to a person who doesnt participate. For example, if you sign up for volleyball club after school after the principal made the announcement that you have too. You now not only have a way to exercise but also an activity to help take your mind off everything else. Even if you sign up for a learning club or activity, like a \"\"teaching you how to eat healthy club\"\", can impact your life. But you can get healthier after participating in a club or activity. If your going through a rough time then for some people a good thing would for you to do something other than mope around about it. You can developÂ good sportsmanshipÂ and other great qualities of a person. In other words many good influences can come off of having to do an activity.\n \n Interaction with other people is almost a given when participating in any sort of activity. Human interaction is a huge part of everything in our world. But so many people today have a hard time with it for many different reasons. So if you start at a younger age, trying to get better to interact with people, you'll get set for the rest of your life. As you interact and talk to people you learn a lot. You developÂ a sense of great team work and friendship. So many friendships are started when you start talking to people at these actives. You'll feel not alone and a great friend can rub off some good traits, making you a better person. In conclusion, interaction is great to do and going to these activities will help you interact with people.\n \n Activities make you stay busy, and take up your time in a good way. People who don't participate in activities will get bored easily and often. While someone who does participate in one will have a lot more to do. For example, if you participate in a spring lacrosse league and on a random Sunday you get bored you can practice lacrosse in your backyard. Another example might be if you participate in boy scouts or girl scouts you may have homework to do before your next meeting. But all a person has that doesn't participate in any activities is sitting on their bed or a couch on their phones. Then every hour theyll think to themselves how bored they are. Participating in activities gets you busy and not as bored as often.\n \n Making kids participate in any activity, or sport is a great idea. Why? Well because great benefits come from participating in activities like keeping you active, interacting with others, and keeping you busy. Whatever you do whether its a club, sport, or just a plain activity of some sort, many opportunities can show up for you. A new passion developed can introduce a job oppritunity or hobby. Doing activities is a wonderful experience that you have to do yourself. Even if you might not completely like what youre doing at first. Who knows maybe you'll find your new passion and hobby.

Parent can also get involve by supporting their children.\n \n In conclusion, there are many benefit when it comes to getting students involve in an extracurricular activities. Students can make new friends, they get to experience new thing, and get to express them self through the activities. Some may say if every students have to get involve in an extracurricular activities. Then, it just going to limit the time that the students get to spend with their family. However, is it going to change anything if parent don't get their children involve in activities? The students is just going to keep playing their phone 4 hours every single day. If parent don't wan't their kid to be 24/7 on their phone. Then, get them involve in an activities at school.Â",

        "It's just another ordinary day in school an so tired and stressed. But luckily you are saved by playing you favorite sport, or you like going round the school taking pictures for a yearbook, you could even be reading your favorite book with your friends in a book club. I believe that students should be allowed to do at least one extracurricular activity of there choice. Because it relieves stress and make students look forward to school, can also be good for the school, and help student figure out what they want to do after they are done with school.\n \n I think that these school activities are good because the student can use these activities as a way to relieve stress by reading. These groups can also include counseling if the student has any problems outside or inside of school. lastly students can use these activities to learn about what they and other student want to learn, for example if the student wanted to learn photography he/she would be allowed to take pictures of flowers or animals. This is why I believe that students can relieve stress from school or from family.\n \n Another that we should allow these activities is that they not only benefit the students but can also benefit the school.\n \n this is because the student can make a club that every week they pick a random teacher and show her/him appreciation for helping us learn. Another thing a students can do is create posters for the school sports team. And they could help put together a school yearbook. This is how these activities will also help the school out.\n \n lastly I think that this could be very helpful for the student and allow them to explore what they want to do. We can do this buy creating activities that can show the students hands on experience of the jobs they can do in the future. for example we could show the how to do there taxes or how to sign up for a credit card. I do personally believe this is a very important thing that we could show the students so they learn early on how to deal with life.\n \n This is why I agree that student should take a extracurricular activities of there choice because it helps with many things. Such as relieving stress and making students happy. Can also help out the teachers and the school. And lastly let kids be aware of what they are going to face in the future and how to deal with it.",

        "There are a lot of students that like to stay after school for extracurricular activities . Other students go home and don't even stay after school at all. I strongly disagree that students should not participate in a extracurricular activity if they don't want to. Some students have responsibilities at home for example. Taking care of a younger sibling, cleaning the house, helping their parents out, etc... but on the other hand if students are going home to play video games,not interacting with other people in the outside world then they should,becauseÂ they can't be inside all day they need some fresh air and interact with other human beings.\n \n But heres the thing students already have school for about 7-8 hours half of the time either listening to the teacher or taking a test so obviously they leave school tried and exhausted.\n \n Many students don't even like coming to school and still show up I think if the principal forced students to join a extracurricular activity the percentage of students skipping will increase and students might not even show up to school.\n \n We also have to think about the teachers ,you are obviously going to need a teacher to stay with the student for whatever curricular activity they get assigned to but believe it or not teachers have a life outside of school. They might have kids that they need to take care of , they might have a parttime job and they also need to look out for themselves too. What if they want to go to the gym but they can't because they have to stay after school with a couple of students so honestly it wouldn't really be fair to the teachers.\n \n The majority of students wake up really early to go to school and when they arrive at school they are tired and exhaustedÂ so when they leave they wont be thinking about stay for an activity they will be thinking of going home and laying in bed. We all have the right to do what we want as long as its legal so as a citizen the students have a right to make the choice of joining a extracurricular activity or just going home and do whatever they want. There are many reasons why students should participate in an extracurricular activity but there are also many other reason why they shouldn't.\n \n There for I think students should not participate in extracurricular activities because at the end of the day they are just kids and they wont have much energy after being in school for about eight hours. We should think about both teachers and stduents.

        "Countless students follow the same after-school routine. After a long day at school, they joyfully return home with a smile on their face. That happiness is because while they were forced to learn and work at school, there are no expectations like that at home. As the sun rises and sets, they have the freedom to mindlessly waste the rest of the day away. That's why rather than spending time outdoors, focusing on hobbies, or spending time with friends and family, students just lock themselves into their rooms. Then, they proceed to pull out their electronics and play away until the end of the day. It's an extremely unhealthy yet addictive lifestyle. But, that lifestyle could change if students had an after-school activity to attend. They would start spending more attention to what's outside of the virtual world. Thus, it is my firm belief that every student should be required to participate in an least one extracurricular activity because it will increase student productivity, improve students' social skills, and promote student engagement.\n \n If an extracurricular activity became a requirement, students would have a more beneficial activity to attend after-school. Every day, when school comes to an end, many students find themselves with hours and hours of free time. However, they end up accomplishing nothing because they have no tasks to complete and no activities to participate in. So, they turn to their main source of entertainment- electronics. And while students are fortunate enough to have the entire day to spend on their phones and computers, no good comes out of it. That's why extracurricular activities are necessary. Students may resent it at first, but in the long run it will create significant improvements to their lifestyle. Students could spend their free timeÂ on activities more worthwhile. They could be winning a soccer championship or fund raisingÂ for those in need. The entire world is there for students to explore and discover. All students need is a small push in the right direction.\n \n Furthermore, extracurricular activities also give students opportunities to interact with their peers. It can be intimidating for students when they have to join a group of complete strangers. However, although it is nerve-wracking, students have the wonderful opportunity to make new friends. Their team will contain people of a similar age group and perhaps similar interests. Besides, with how frequent meetings are, members will be spending an abundance of time together; they're guaranteed to form new friendships. On the contrary, extracurricular activities also help maintain current friendships. It can be difficult to meet up with friends out of school, so joining an extracurricular activity allows students to get together more often. All in all, as it goes with any team, members form a tight bond with one another. By the end of the year, they'll be surprised by the amount of new friends they've made.\n \n Lastly, extracurricular activities promote students' engagement with their community. Students rarely ever have an opportunity to venture beyond their small school environment, which consequently limits the amount of change they're able to make. However, with extracurricular activities, students will have more opportunities to make an impact on their community. For example, being a part of the student council gives you many opportunities to make a difference. Members raise awareness of issues, fund raiseÂ for the needy, and even more. Being active in a team like that motivates students. With all they accomplish, they being to feel much more productive and hence acquire a sense of belonging. That results in students truly believing they can make a difference in the world, which then causes them to become more engaged and active in their community.\n \n It's common knowledge that extracurricular activities are extremely beneficial, yet many students still hesitate from participating and consequently miss out on amazing opportunities. Extracurricular activities have a much larger role than just providing entertainment. They allow students to become more productive, social, and active in their community. We can't allow students to miss out on a chance to build those skills. The experiences they obtain from the extracurricular activities will stick with them for life. Therefore, if participating becomes a requirement, our world will become a much better place. Students may have their doubts about extracurricular activities, but they will truly be tremendously changed by them. The requirement of extracurricular activities will allow our world to raise much healthier and productive generations. With just a simple requirement, the future of our society will look much brighter.Â  Â",

Generic_Name, the principal of Generic_School believes that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Making student participate in at least one extracurricular activity is very unfair policy. This mean that all student must participate in either a school sport, yearbook committee, or be apart of the student council. Some students already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school, or have health problem that don't allow them to participate in sports, and students shouldn't be forced to participate in something they don't want to participate in.\n \n If student already participate in an extracurricular activity outside of school this would make them participate in 2 sports which would be a really hard time schedule to balance. With all the competitions that most sports team compete in this would make it hard to find time for studying and completing homework. Competing on 2 sports teams in very uncommon because it is so hard to manage.\n \n Everyone has some health issue or problem that they must be careful of when participating in physical activities. 50% of Americans have Asthma and 30% of Americans have breathing issues. When kids are young it is hard to diagnoseÂ Asthma. If these kids were on a school sports team and had an Asthma attack there would be no way to help them because if they were never diagnosed with Asthma, they won't have an inhalerÂ to help them. This whole incident would have never happened if the Mrs. Jones hadn't required students to participate in one extracurricular activity.\n \n Students shouldn't be forced to participate in activities they don't want to participate in. This rule is UN-Constitutional and should be gone immediately. It is forcing students to do something they don't want to do. Being in an area where you have been forced to do something you don't want to do doesn't make a very good learning environment. This makes very hostile environment for students and it doesn't make them feel very comfortable.\n \n Making student participate in at least one extracurricular activity is very unfair policy. Some students already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school, or have health problem that don't allow them to participate in sports, and students shouldn't be forced to participate in something they don't want to participate in.

        "Ever been rushed around? Have had so much to do in so little time? What if you had to do a extra activity on top of that? Would your life be hectic? I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activityÂ For example, time is something that passes all the time. Not all of the students can get a ride, adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. In all, adding extracurricular actives is a bad idea.\n \n Time. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscousÂ cycle. Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air.\n \n buses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figureÂ out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride.\n \n Sols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed. Making kids do something that that they don't have time to do creates a lot of stress. Students should be able to chose what they want to do. If they can handle doing extracurricularÂ activates then they can, it shouldn't be a must. Making kids do something that isn't needed will drag them down making them now want to come to school.

        "I think that forcing all students to participate in an extracurricular activity would cause stress in many different ways. Students already have a lot of school work to do and making them do this would be difficult. I disagree with this decision because, students may have school work to do, may be a care provider for the family, or might have a job to do. This could also result in a lack of effort in certain things at school and at home.\n \n If students have a lot of school work to do they could become stressed from not being able to get the work done. Students also might need to study and would not have time to do that, therefore, causing them to get a bad grade on it. This could also result in a bad grade on their report card, maybe even causing them to fail the class. If the students fail the class they will have to retake the class the next year, and if the students were already struggling with the class they would have to do it all over again causing stress in that way to. To much stress causes anxiety which can be harmful to the students self confidence, could make them sad or depressed, and many other problems.\n \n Students might be a main provider for their family, taking care of family members, and paying for stuff the family needs. They might also be paying the bills or buying food and clothes for their family members. If students can't provide for their family they could become homeless or become sick.

        "The principal at my school decided that all students need to take an extracurricular activity. How should I, as a student, feel about this? Do I agree with their decision? What is an extracurricular activity, and why did my principal make this decision? Figuring out the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, and how they impactthe students, will help me conclude how I feel about this choice.\n \n What are extracurricular activities? These activities are something a student could participate in to entertain or captivate them. Examples of these activities could be an art class, sports, or even a chess club. Normally, these activities are something you personally enjoy, or have a passion for. They could be in school, after school, or maybe not in school at all. One way how most schools get you to take an extracurricular activity, is by offering electives. Most schools have electives as a fun class for students, or something they enjoy learning. Another reason schools might have electives, is for the mind to grow, and find fun in certain activities. Not everyone has the same passion, so there are many options. You don't necessarily need to be good at an extracurricular activity, you just have to love, or have fun doing it.\n \n What is the reasoning behind the principalÂ forcing the students to take at least one activity? Cellphones are one of the main entertainment for teenagers, them often spending many hours a day on them. Even if you enjoy using your device, it is not the type of passion most adults would choose. Making students do an extracurricular activity might positivelyÂ give them a push to try new things. Taking an in or out of school activity may expand the students outlook on electives or clubs the school offers, and alluding for them to try something new. Going to these clubs or activities, offers new friendships as well. Other people that take the same activity as you, may also share the same passion. It is easier to connect with people who are similar to you. The principal would want the best for their school, and by making the students take an activity, they get new educational experiences.\n \n Even though these activities can have a positive effect on the students, there can also be negatives. Some students don't care about finding a passion, or an activity for them to do. They might just want to take a class that gives them an \"\"easy a\"\", not because it's something they would actually do for fun. Not only that, but some students just try to get into a class with their friend. That friend might be taking a class that doesn't interest the student. Taking a subject or activity that is boring or uninteresting to you, won't help you find what you like to do. When forcing the students to take an activity, while it might help them find their interests and explore new things, it might also force them to do unwanted subjects that don't please them.\n \n In conclusion to this prompt, I agree with the decision of the principal to make all students take an extracurricular activity. Forcing the students to take an extracurricular activity, can effect them greatly. It offers them experiences, finding what they like to do best, and discovering what they are good at. It can expand their communication with other people, and overall, make new friends. These activities, depending on what they are, can be good for your health. Some students don't particularly care about finding what they like to do, and would rather just be with their friends or use their cellular device. Making these students take an extracurricular activity, can make them discover new things that they didn't know or realize before.",

        "Have you ever tried an in-school sport or club? Many students enjoy extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. But some students aren't as keen on the idea. Some think it's a waste of time, or that they're very boring. But extracurricular activities help students and schools in many different ways. I think students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity because the students will learn new skills, students will become more social, and the school will become more diverse in it's interests.\n \n There are many skills to be learned in extracurricular activities. Depending on what activity it is, you can be taught a wide variety of talents. After school sports will teach you the basics to the game, and then maybe you'll make it to the school team for that sport. Certain clubs will teach students other games and talents. At my old school, there was a huge chess club. Some of the kids that went to it every Wednesday didn't even know how to play at first. Then they learned, as any other student could if they attended a mandatory extracurricular activity. Some clubs can even teach students the basics of just being a good student or friend, like the homework club, or the diversity club. So if every student took a mandatory extracurricular activity, everyone would learn a lot.\n \n Students can become more social through extracurricular activities. The more students spend time with people with similar interests, the more friends they'll make. If a student was to only hangout with the same group of friends all year, he or she would never become more social, which is a good skill to have as you get older. Besides, a student might make a life long friend through an extracurricular activity. Even if a student doesn't make any new friends through extracurricular activities, they'll still have learned important communication and social skills.\n \n If a school has a large variety of extracurricular activities that every student is attending at least one, the school will become more diverse in the student's intersests. Diversity in a school is very important for many reasons. Diversity would look good on how the rest of the county views the school. Then they might follow suite and make extracurricular activities mandatory. Another reason why diversity in a school is important because the students will impact each other and make each other want to try more activities, making a postitive cycle in which students want to partcipate in extracurricular activities, therefore benefiting them in the other ways, social and skill benefits.\n \n In all, mandatory extracurricular activities will help our school system in plenty of ways. They'll teach students skills, make students more social, and make the school more diverse. These are just some of the reasons that schools need mandatory extracurricular activities. If you want madatory extracurricular activities at your school, start a petitionfor your principal to see. Even if that doesn't work, you can always just convince your friends and classmates to go to these extracurricular activities. This is why I believe schools should have mandatory extracurricular activities.",

        "Have you ever wondered about the benefits of students participating in an activity? Extracurricular activities can have many things to it. Some activities can be sports,yearbook designing,student council, and many other things that students can enjoy. Students would have a great time and enjoy these types of things and can find different kinds of activities they could participate in. All students should participate in an activity because it can help students find an interest,students can enjoy it, and can help keep their minds distracted from school.\n \n Students can find different activities to find an interest/hobby. Students who don't usually participate in activities or events can find something new if they are being told to do something. Hence, making a student find an activity means that they will be searching to find one, and will lead to finding an activity they find interesting and try it out. In other words, students who doodle once in a while might find an art related activity and join. In addition, this can also help them keep an open mind and not think that all or some activities are boring or considering them as something they would never like doing. Some students might also be shy or not be involved to much in things so they might want to join an activity but are to scared to participate. This means that when students must pick an activity they can feel relieved and happy to do so.\n \n Some students can enjoy having extracurricular activities. For example, student would enjoy having activities because they can be able to do something that they enjoy instead of having class. To add to this, students that are athletic wouldn't be able to play a sport during class because it isn't allowed and would be very disruptive. Therefore, when students are allowed to choose an activity that would make them joyful and excited to join the one they connect with the most. This will also be beneficial to the class/classes that a person is in because they have already done what they wanted during their activity and it can help them focus in their classes more efficiently.\n \n The minds of students can be distracted from school related things. Students nowadays can become stressed, and can cause their brain to be less efficient. Students can be feeling down and even depressed which is a very bad situation for students since they have lots of things piled on them. Some of these things would include projects,homework, essays, and other things that can be personal to that student. Therefore, by joiningÂ an activity students can relieve their mind off certain topics and think about other things. While in an extracurricular activity they can communicate with others and can find new friends too. In addition, they can also find an activity that can help them relax and be more calm. For example, a meditation club (activity) would be very helpful or an art activity so they can draw out their emotion/feelings.\n \n Overall, students should all participate in activities. This is because it can be appealing to some students and not so appealing to others, but this can make them find different activities/opportunities and keep them open minded. Students can also find new friendships and can be distracted from school related things which keeps their minds functioning. Extracurricular activities include lots of different things and students can enjoy it and consider participating in one or more activities. Students should all join an activity because it helps them clear their minds,some students enjoy activities, and it can help students find an interest/hobby. Â Â Â",

        "A tiresome day of school just ended, but instead of being exhausted, you are exited because your extracurricular activity is about to start. Many students go to school everyday, then leave on the bus, or walk home, until returning the next day. Because a lot of students do that, the majority of them never experience any clubs that the schools works hard to put together. By making students try out a club, they would appreciate what the school has to offer. Principals should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help students be active in the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students explore some of their interests for the future.\n \n One reason that a school's principal should require students to have to participate in at least one activity after schoolÂ is so that students become active in the school once the hours of school are done. Students who stay after schoolÂ for an extracurricular activity participate in some of the schools programs. This leaves a stronger connection from the students to the school. Students can choose out of many clubs offered, and thereforeÂ feel as if they found a bigger reason to stay in school. A reason that students should be required to participate in an after schoolÂ activity is so they are more active in the school.\n \n Another reason that school principal should make kids participate in an after schoolÂ club is so that kids can interact better with others. When students join a club in school, they meet new kids, ones with similar interests as them. Because of their shared interests, students can form a bond, all because of this club. Kids would also talk with the teachers running each club activity because they have more in common, like a passion for the club. A second reason that kids should have to participate in a extracurricular activity at school is so they learn to interact better with both students and teachers.\n \n Lastly, if a school principal made students join an after schoolÂ club, students would find and explore some of their interests. Students all have their own interests and hobbies, but to find them, one would have to look. Middle and high school students are at the perfect age to explore passions because they are getting ready to pick a major in college, so they are looking high and low for an idea of what their major will be. By joining a club at your school, students will find some club that pulls at them, inviting them to join. Also, students would have time after schoolÂ to try new clubs or sports. For example, an interested student could choose to participate in the yearbook committee, or even the SCA. One last reason that students should participate in an after school club is because they can figure out some of their hobbies and passions before college.\n \n In Conclusion, if a school principal required that all students must participate in some after school club, students would become more active around the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students expand their hobbies. A student would have a bigger purpose to stay at school if they had to join a club, giving them a stronger connection to the school. The interactions between students and teachers would be higher because they would have more in common. Finally, students would explore many different career paths for college and have a varied set of interests when participating in after school clubs. Principals, by making your students participate in an extracurricular activity, you help students in a lot of ways, so consider trying out this idea for a better future for your students.Â",

Also, they may need to get rest for a different activity outside of school.\n \n The principal should rethink about this idea, because some students have reasons why they can't participate in his or her school extracurricular activities. Such as, students being uninterested in playing sports, working on the yearbook, or serving student council. No transportation from school, after they are done with the activity. Also, some students have important things to do at home after school. This decision is not a good idea for the students. Let students make their own decisions about what they would like to do!

        "Regarding the decisionÂ the Principal made, (\"\"all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity\"\")\n \n I agree with for the following reasons.\n \n The first reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will improve social life for many students at our school.\n \n Social Life is very important for kids my age because, it helps build character, (which means, it builds up personalityÂ and special traits within a certain student) creates new friendships, (always a good thing to have) and it will also make the student feel like they're a part of something.\n \n Another reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will also help students who are dealing with personal stress. As everyone knows, a lot of kids my age suffer from different types of stress. Which are mostly caused by either depression, anxiety or even loneliness. Which means that with this new opportunity they have, their depression, anxiety, and loneliness might go down a bit as they get to interact with other students while they participate in activities they might of never even tried before.\n \n The final reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will even help students develop time management skills. Most students at our school (that I know of) either don't have time or don't know how to fit everyday activities like school, homework, and free time in their everyday lives. So, since they have to participate in something new now, it might open up their eyes a bit and help them see how to distribute their time, which will result in them having some free time at the end of the day.\n \n In conclusion, I think the Principal's decision to make students attend or take an extracurricular activity is a great idea because, it improves social life, lowers stress some students might have, and also helps students develop time management skills.",

        "Students should not have to participate in activities because some students might not have any interests in the activities the school provides them with. Teachers, and parents always tell me \"\"school comes first\"\", but the principal is more worried if a student makes practice on time. Now cm not saying activities are bad for students, but why does every student have to participate when they should be more worried about their future. Kids are more worried about missing their clubs than missing the notes that the teacher is providing before the test. Students should not participate in activities because some kids might not have any interests, kids should be more worried about their education than their clubs, and last but not least, kids are missing missing the notes that the teachers provide for the kids so they can pass their test.\n \n Not only does this situation affects students, but it also affects teachers and parents. Most teacher are anxious for kids because they have doubt that the students will not pass their assignments or even their class. Parents are terrified of the school calling them because their kid is not passing. Getting an education should be a kid's top priority because not one dream will be possible without an education. This situation can affect teachers and parents because they both get anxious when their kids are not passing a class, A kid's top priority should be getting an education.\n \n School activities are good when students are still doing good in school. activities should not be in frontÂ of education but kids will put it there when teachers are forcing students to take an extracurricular course. Most students only want to learn when they walk into school. But they are being forced to join an activity that has no relevancy. School activities are good when kids are passing, a kids education should always be first, being forced to join an activity is not right.\n \n When I was 13 years old in seventh grade, I was on a basketball team. When I walked into practice my coach called me in to talk about my grades and why I was failing, he didn't care about what I had to say so he cut me from the team. When I walked home my anxiety level went through the roof because I was trying to find a way to bring up my grades before the school year ends. When I told my parents what happened they started panicking and hitting and told me it was way too late to bring my grades up and I might fail. My body felt cold and I was depressed, I begged my teachers for help everyday but they told me that it still would not bring all of my grades up. Because I didn't care about my school work I had bad grades, I had anxiety, and last knowing I couldn't do nothing to bring my grades up gave me depression.\n \n Students should not have to participate in school activities because most kids might not have interests in them. activities can affect a kids grades which can have teachers and parents worried. Kids will put their activity as their top priority when getting their education should be. Students, and the school staff should be more productive with students education. Activities are not a bad idea but forcing kids to join a extracurricular course is not right because that is not what school is about.",

        "Neville Longbottem transformed from a blundering idiot to the hero who destroyed Voldemort's most precious Horcurx. How did he do this? Through extracurriculars, which are also extremely important for students in the real world. I agree with my principal that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities encourage students to become more confident and brings to light their hidden qualities, while also giving them skills that will be useful throughout their whole life. Students can also discover their passion through extracurriculars, which could eventually become their life's work.\n \n Extracurricular activities instills confidence in a person and helps them show others their best qualities. If we dig deep into Neville Longbottom's school life, we discover that everything changed after he joined Dumbledore's Army, a club founded by Harry Potter to encourage the learning of Defense Against the Dark Arts. He gained confidence while he took over the club for Harry, and his true qualities of bravery and courage really shined through. Confidence is important because studies have proven that a person who is clearly confident is more respected by their peers. Possessing confidence helps a person to have good mental health as well and boosts up happiness levels by at least 80%. It is also important for a person to show others who they truly are, because hiding their true qualities creates feelings of dissatisfaction, which is overall detrimental towards a person's happiness. Helping students open up and gain confidence are just one of the several benefits that extracurriculars provide.\n \n Students gain necessary life skills as well as confidence through extracurriculars. These life skills are often skills that can only be acquired through experience. Social skills such as leadership can definitely be acquired, and it is a coveted skill that can eventually lead to success. Just look at Neville! Proof that leaders are made, not born. Students also learn the importance of commitment as well as the skill of cooperation through extracurriculars like sports. In Quidditch, a sport that requires a ton of commitment and cooperation, Harry Potter learned to drag himself out of bed at the crack of dawn and deal with foul opponents, something which would definitely help him later on in life after he became the Head of the Auror Office. One of the most important skills a person can learn while doing an extracurricular is time management. Most self-made billionaires are masters of time management. Balancing extracurriculars with school is no simple feat, and will definitely prove to be useful in the future.\n \n One of the best things about extracurriculars is that it will help a person find that passion which will fuel their life's work. By exploring different clubs and activities, a person can discover what it is that truly ignites fire in their soul. In a recent poll, 87% of the people who have a passion state that they are at least 95% happy about where their life is going. These are incredible numbers compared to the 97% of people who don't have a passion who state that they are less than 30% happy about where their life is going. Another poll has stated that less than an estimated 50% of people do not enjoy going to work. This is because they are not passionate about it. A person who hates their work will not be happy at all, which could result in early health complications. For students in particular, finding a passion is important because colleges are more favorable upon students who have a passion versus those who don't. Having a passion is necessary for happiness, and extracurriculars will help students find their passion.\n \n I strongly believe that extracurriculars are necessary. They help students gain confidence and a passion and teaches important life skills. Most importantly, they make students happy. Neville Longbottom, the former laughingstock of Hogwarts, transformed himself through an extracurricular. Even though Neville is fictional, he proves the importance of extracurriculars, and shows exactly why every student should participate in at least one.Â",

        "Whether it's a lovable hobby of yours or an aspiration, there is always a task a person loves to carry out.\n \n Mandatory extracurricular activities would be a phenomenal addition to the requirements of our school.\n \n I find this decision to be fantastic because it gives the opportunity to students to practice unknown activities and find new passions that drive them forward.\n \n In addition, the school too would benefit from the growing skills and work put out by the students through extracurricular activities.\n \n The first reason why I agree with our school in this decision, is because it will provide the opportunity for both me and my classmates to practice the unknown and find new passions for us to follow.\n \n This practicing of new activities will provide us students a development in our skills.\n \n For instance, if I were to become the head of the student council I would experience how to become a leader, the skills needed to be a leader, and how to drive my classmates to become better students.\n \n Secondly, a new drive or passion for our motivation could become discovered through the practicing of extracurricular activities.\n \n As a result of this finding of new passion or drive, both me and my classmates would be able to figure out what it is we really aspire to be in the future to come.\n \n Finally, the experience that would be provided to us through extracurricular activities, be it sports, leadership roles, or other extracurricular activities that are available to us, would be extremely helpful in our futures.\n \n Specifically, the work ethics that would be highly important in our future in college and even when having a job, these work ethics would be taught like wildfire in any extracurricular activity as long as participation and active engagement is exercised.\n \n The growing passion and drive combined with the learning of skills and work ethics will surely benefit both me and my schoolmates in the future to come.\n \n As for the second reason I support my school's decision, it is due to the fact that my classmates will not be the only to gain through the mandatory extracurricular activities rule, the growing skills along with the hard workÂ that will be progressively demonstrated by the students will surely benefit the school in more ways than one.\n \n A major part of any school, the yearbook, could be made and designed by the people who are inside of the yearbook.\n \n Specifically, the feelings, emotions and bonds created and felt throughout the year by myself and by my schoolmates, could only be expressed inside a yearbook through the people who made those bonds and felt those feelings.\n \n However, that is not the only benefit, the students of the school will also be able to make a more deep and connecting bond through both the teachers and through each other.\n \n For instance, not every club or sports team can run by a teacher or by a student, this diverse teaching environment that will be provided will prove to show a deeper connection through my schoolmates and through their main learning environment.\n \n Lastly, the improvement of attraction to our school will encourage every student to work harder and become better students along with better learners.\n \n In depth, the increased need to work hard and utilize the skills learned through extra curricular activities will increase the grades, performance, and attentiveness of many students in class and outside of class.\n \n All in all, this decision will not only grow myself along with my classmates, but the school in a whole.\n \n The third and final reason why I agree and wholeheartedlyÂ support the decision of my school is because both me and my schoolmates will be able to grow mentally, and physically through the extracurricular activities.\n \n First off, the improvements of the number of people participating in extracurricular activities will prove beneficial for people who are in study groups.\n \n As a result of the increased amount of people taking extracurricular activities, an increased amount of people will join study groups which will allow more sharing of knowledge through older members and newer members.\n \n Secondly, sports teams will be able to have more competition, therefore increasing the skill gap between players.\n \n More people participating in extracurricular activities means more people trying out for sports teams which results in a higher demand to play for the team, whether it be basketball, soccer, football or other sports, the high demand will cause an increase in specific member choosing for the teams and will also cause an increase in team spots, therefore increasing the skill of the teams and creating more ways for myself and other students to play sports and grow ourselves physically through those sports.\n \n Lastly, mental sports teams like chess, Sudoku, and other mental sports, will see the same increase.\n \n Specifically an increase of mental capacity being held by our school's students, and with this increase in mental capacity needed to play games like chess, it causes an increase in schoolwork performance, and other schoolwork related items such as tests and quizzes.\n \n The improvement in mental and physical prowess being presented will surely produce results for my schoolmates in the future to come.\n \n The addition of mandatory extracurricular activities to our school will prove to be a promising and progressive choice.\n \n Firstly, students are going to able to practice unknown activities, find new passions, and find new friends while still growing themselves.\n \n Secondly, these growing skills and hard work that will come to be expressed by both me and my schoolmates will prove beneficial not only for us, but for the school as well.\n \n Finally, students will be able to express their mental and physical growth and increase that mental and physical growth through these extracurricular activities.\n \n I believe without a doubt that the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities is the best decision our school has ever made.Â",

        "Would you like to be forced to do something you don't want to do? Of course not, students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities if they don't want to. We need to stand up for student rights, they should have the choice ifÂ they want to do activities or not. There are many reasons to support this like, the cost of essential items, students not having a way home, and most importantly most kids have to take care of younger siblings and wouldn't have time.\n \n Firstly, forcing students to do after school activities is not fair, and neither is the price to pay for it. The average cost for sports equipment if five hundred dollars, and most families can't pay that. Lets say your child decides to not do a sport and chooses to be on student council, and they have a meeting at 7:00 in the evening, someone is gonna have to take them, so there goes at least thirty dollars in gas money. So do yourself and your kids a favor and be against it.\n \n Secondly, if your child has to do an after school activity, they must get home somehow. Most parents don't get off work till six o-clock, and lets say your kids practice ends at five o-clock, or maybe even four o-clock, your child would be alone at school for more than an hour, and thats a long time. No child should have to be alone for that long and doing something they don't want to do.\n \n Lastly, if your child has younger siblings and they have to take care of they after school, they wont have time for other activities. Generic_Name is a fourteen year old girl and has a three year old sister named Generic_Name . Every day she comes home and plays with her, feeds her, and gives her everything she needs while mom isÂ at work. If Generic_Name has to stay after school for an activity, what would Generic_Name do? This was the most important reason, kids just don't have time.\n \n In conclusion, we can all agree that students should not be forced to do after school activities, the cost is to much, they may not have a way home and they might hot have time because of younger siblings to take care of. Don't let someone force your kid to do an activity they don't want to do. Next time your at a parents meeting for your kids school and the principle asks for who is against all students being forced to do an extracurricular activity, raise your hand for the sake of you and your loving, passionate kid.Â Â Â",

Us students simply wouldn't have time for anything else which is why I disagree with making students dp a curricular activity. Some of us students just don't have the time and are far to busy with things like getting home late, doing homework or studing, plus some kids babysit.\n \n The first reason I disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. Parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. Plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.\n \n The second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. If you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. This will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. Which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.\n \n The third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin.

I am against this because you may want to spend time with family, you may have to do something after school, and the people your working with in the activity are not working or helping you.\n \n To begin with, you may have to do something out side of school, like you and your house hold have to go out of town. Most of the time, kids leave there room messy in the morning when picking out their clothes so after school they have to clean their room. Or, you might have a appointment after school. And sometimes, students have to work after school or help their mom or dad with work.\n \n Also, you may want to spend time with your family. A family member or friend could be very sick and that could be the last time you see them. Sometimes, your parents have split up and you are on a weekly play when you get to see your mother or father. Often, you may want to have a meet because your friend of family member has past away.\n \n Finally, the people your working with are not doing their part. Most of the time, I get put in a activity group with students that are lazy and get off task easily by others. Often, you or the students your working with may not get along, or maybe had issues in the past. Sometimes, I have students in my activity group that play around too much. Or, they may not be good at what the activity is and not do any work.\n \n In conclusion, the reason I am against this because you may want to spend time with your family and friends, most people have to do something after school, and the people in your group may not be helpful.",

        "I do not agree with this, if students were required to take an extracurricular it may not work for everyone. Examples are; it may cause stress or anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after schoolÂ students may not have time for it. These following reason are why extracurricular activities should not be mandatory.\n \n Extracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety. For example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends, and if their friends aren't interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity. They also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity, they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to. The student may feel the need to attend every single meeting which may also cause stress or anxiety. There are two more reasons that an extracurricular activity should not be required.\n \n Students may not like any extracurricular activity that was offered. There may have been something the student really wanted to do and it wasn't provided. The student may then not like anything that is offered on the list. If the student does not like any extracurricular activity they should not be forced into one. Forcing a student into an activity they do not want to do could be stressful on them or result in a violent reaction.Â There is a final reason why extracurricular activities should not be required.\n \n Students may not have the time for an extracurricular activity if it is after school. Some students have things going on as soon as they get home, it could be another sport that is not in school or just going out after school. A lot of people usually don't have time for an activity that is after school if they are already in a sport that is not at the school. This could also result in not getting homework done or getting bad grades. The extracurricular activity could easily get in the way of these things a students has to do.\n \n If a extracurricular activity was needed I do not think it should be mandatory. It could cause any of the listed things; stress and anxiety, students may not like anything that is offered, and If it's after schoolÂ students may not have time for it. I personally think these are valid reason not to require extracurricular activities.",

        "After-school activities offer a variety of things, and students often choose to stay after school to enjoy them. However, being forced to stay past school hours to participate wouldn't be much fun for something that's supposed to be an activity to enjoy in your free time. Students should not have to participate in after-school activities, because some students may have other matters they need to attend to (family, jobs, etc), may already be doing a time-consuming activityÂ outside of school, or may not have transportation home.\n \n Students may already have things to do that take up after-school time: for example, they could be needed to babysit younger siblings, to take care of another family member, to do household chores, or to work an after-school job. Requiring students to do an after-school activity would take up this time, where they might be really needed.\n \n Having students participate in things beside schoolwork is important, but not more important than family or work needs. They might be leaving a younger child alone, just because they have to participate inÂ a sport or student council. There are things more important than extracurricular activities.\n \n Students may also have an outside-of-school activity to participate in at the time. Many students choose to take lessons or sports outside of school. For example, they might have private instrument lessons, a neighborhood science club, or a sport team that isn't school-involved. These activities are just as important as school ones, and they shouldn't be forced to miss them because of requiring extracurricular clubs. The outside-of-school activities are often paid for, or require money in some way. This would lead to a loss of money for the parents, paying for lessons that the students can't attend.Â Students may lead busy lives, and they shouldn'tÂ have to have them taken up by even more school-required things.\n \n Another reason school clubs shouldnt be enforced is that while buses and parent pick-up are often available at the end of the school day, it is not always the same when it's already been an hour after school. Parents also often have busy schedules, and they can't always be available to drive their student home. That is one reason why some students choose not to participateÂ in extracurricular activities. But ifÂ studentsÂ are being forced to stay after school, they might not have a ride home. This would create a problem, because then most of the school would need a bus ride home, and that would require a lot of buses and bus drivers. This would be very financially taxing for the school, so it would be better to just let students go home at the end of the school day. They have already been required to attend school for seven hours; it would not be fair to make them stay longer for something that isn't even education-related.\n \n In summary, students have busy lives already, taken up by chores, family commitments, possible after-school jobs, schoolwork, and outside-of-school activities. They shouldn't be forced to add more things to their schedule. Extracurricular activities are meant to something fun and enjoyable in a student's free time, a choice to partake in something they find interesting. Making students attend extracurricularÂ activities would take the fun out of it - it's supposed to a chance students can take, not another thing forced upon them. These students have lives to live, things to take care of, other time-consuming responsibilities in life that are more important than school-related ones. Let extracurricular activities remain as a choice for students.",

        "This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.\n \n Most students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.\n \n Students tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.\n \n We all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.\n \n Principals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things about doing a sport after school. You should go out and try for any sport you can and you can get better and better everyday. Nobody is holding you back from doing something you want to try doing.",

        "Why do nothing, when you can do something that will help you no and in your future?\n \n Students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity.\n \n The principle's choice to have every student to do an extracurricular activity is a good choice because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, Students get to meet kids that they normally wouldn't meet just in school, and students will get an example on what it is like to work with a team or group.\n \n First, it is good for students to participate in one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests.\n \n People that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.\n \n You hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.\n \n But, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.\n \n The people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.\n \n For example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.\n \n The student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.\n \n Then eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.\n \n Finally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group.\n \n Next, it would be good for students to do an extracurricular activity because they will get to meet people that they normally wouldn't meet when you are in school.\n \n Joining a team or group will be nerve racking at first because you might not know anyone that share the same interests as you do.\n \n But when the team/group finally gets to talking, they will have bonded so that nobody could break them apart.\n \n It is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.\n \n In school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.\n \n But when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.\n \n People that you once thought were \"\"weird\"\", or \"\"annoying,\"\" are now your friends because you realized that they actually have the same personality that you do.\n \n Finally, it is important to do at least one extracurricular activity because students will get a taste of the real world in having to work as a team to get things done.\n \n If students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.\n \n Learning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.\n \n So the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.\n \n If you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.\n \n Nobody will hire you because they will look at your back roundÂ and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.\n \n Nobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.\n \n Finally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.\n \n Most people don't want that, do you?\n \n In conclusion, it would be smart for the principle to implement that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others that have their same interests, students will get to meet other students that they wouldn't normally meet in normal school time, and the students will get an example on what it is like to work as a team and to prosper at doing your work.\n \n Starting with an extracurricular activity now will not only help you now, but it will help you later in life too.

        "Getting the kids to do things in school like different activities and things could help them so much and also have fun with school.\n \n Can you imagine going to school and being able to do other things besides learn? Going to school and getting to play sports during school can help with so many things in life. Going to school and playing sports like basketball, football and soccer and etc, playing those sports during school hours could be fun for the students. For the ones that love to play sports could have so much fun. Playing the sports you like can be fun but also can make you better at the things you do, it is like giving you practice outside of practicing with your team. Kids now in days need to at least do something active everyday. So therefore kids should at least be active of doing something for at least 60 minutes. So it is great to have kids participate in sports in school.\n \n Kids working around schools with technology is also being active in a way. Yearbook is an example of being active and also doing activities. Doing a activity that involves technology can make sure kids can learn things with the things that they are working with in school. Most students prefer using technology anyways so it should also be fun. Technology has games and writing and reading and etc. Those things can help kids have fun but also learn things at the same time. Kids do need to read and write but they can also try to have fun with it if teachers added activities to it. Another thing that can help the students in school is to have at least at 3 min break but also use there technology at the time. These are examples on why students should have technology also as a activity during school.\n \n School could in viseÂ you to do better with things in life, or become the things that you would like to be some day. Helping around at school, could help the teachers out or help the kids become something the want to become. Working with teachers and other students is a great way of participating in school.

Participating in sports is a great idea during school. However, technology is an activity that student's could work on. It is also a better way to have students learn. Also the school could always have students help out with teachers and things. This is why i think it is better to have student to participate in school with sports and different activities.Â",

        "School can often be full of work piling up in the classes we don't enjoy, and stress that gets us down. What if there was a way to make school enjoyable for everyone? Extracurricular activities are teams, clubs, and any other organization run by the school. Many students like these because they have something to look forward to while in school, but not everyone always joins. I believe that students should become a part of organizations because it gives them a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and choose an activity that they enjoy.\n \n In school activities that are outside of class, students have a chance to create bonds with new people. Teams and clubs require working together to make ideas come along, especially student council and sports. This also builds a work ethic for future jobs. Sometimes students may have trouble making friends, so being in a club makes it easy to meet people. Similar interests can also often lead to friendships. Students can also get to know a teacher who sponsors their club better, as many students rarely speak with them in class. Having a more interesting topic to discuss with teachers helps students feel more comfortable around them in class.\n \n Students should become more involved in schools activities. As a yearbook staff member, I know that from experience. I have been able to go onto the basketball courts during pep rallies to get pictures, inform people and work with them about buying a yearbook, and learn about other class when I take pictures and collect information from them. Similarly to student government, students are able to see their hard work pay off when fellow classmates participate in spirit days and other events. With sports, athletes are able to show off their skill and passion for the game while being able to represent their school.\n \n Lastly students are able to choose what they want to be a part of. Not everyone enjoys the problem solving of math or the memorization of history, but it is a requirement to take them. If students join an activity they'll enjoy, then they will have something to look forward to in school. This can also strengthen career paths. If a student is set on becoming a business leader, they can be a part of yearbook or the other organizations that run like a business. If a student is determined to be in the NFL, then they can tryout for the football team. And if they don't find a fit for them, they should be able to make a group themselves. It's important to have a variety of clubs, including students' ideas.\n \n In conclusion, schools should require their students to join extracurriculars just as they require them to take core classes. This is because it gives students a chance to bond with others, become more involved in their school, and be a part of something that they would enjoy.\n \n Students shouldn't dread school, and this is one way to make it better.Â",

Collages like good grades but you would have a stronger resume if you did sports,or worked with the student council. Most collages are looking for someone that can do a variety of activities, doing clubs and sports shows them you have what it takes. Many adults have health problems due to the fact that they are not in shape and a great extracurricular activity is sports so starting at a young age will decrease you chances of having bad health problems.

On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.\n \n Having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.\n \n For example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.\n \n Forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.\n \n Forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities.

        'Nine times out of ten children will get bad habits from not adding an extracurricular activity to their schedule.\n \n Causing them to be lazy and end up with bad grades. Because when you add at least one or more extracurricular activity to your schedule, it can help you be more social, get ready for highÂ school, and have a healthier schedule.\n \n First, is being more social. When getting a new activity to do at the end of the day, you will end up with other people. Meeting different people is one of the ways to clear bad social habits. Because of the fact that they are in the same activity as you, some of them might have the same interests. This can cause you to have new friends, this will help you work with others. Working with others is a good factor when you have an extracurricular, and it\'s not as hard as opinions might think. Working with others has a bad side to it because of this you could get annoyed, but you can get use to it by building tolerance .\n \n The second reason is, that it helps you get ready for high school. To get ready for high school you are going to need a good GPA score meaning you need a high grade if not higher. Getting an extra activity can help you if not guide you to the higher GPA. Sometimes the teachers will give you extra credit activities or let you finish work that you want to get done.\n \n The thirdÂ and final reason is building a healthy schedule. Building a healthy schedule is very important because it can effect what you do now and what you will do in the future. When you add something to your schedule it will help you be able to take hard and stressful tasks. This will help you when ever you dont have a lot of people around to help.\n \n Now some people might say that it\'s ""too hard"",""I just dont need it"" , or "" it takes too much time"". But student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. This counter argument dose not compute with what is needed.\n \n If adding an extra curricular activity to a students time, then it will give them social skills, lead them to high school, and help build a healthy schedule.

I disagree with this statement because, first off some students might not have time to do the extra activity's, secondly the students work hard enough as it is in school, lastly it might be the least favorite thing they do especially if they have to get forced into participating in extracurricular.\n \n Well to start, some students can't stay after, they might need to go home and babysit or watch out for their siblings. Secondly, some kids might have hours of homework that they need to do, they might not have time for extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have after school sports like baseball or football games and they would like to attend to instead of playing or doing something after hours that doesnt matter as much as students sport.\n \n Next, students work all through out the day with hardly any breaks, students want a break from having to deal with taking down notes and hearing a teacher talk for hours. Secondly, lot's of students are stressed out with grades and family problems, so why make them more stressed out by forcing them to do extracurricular activities. Lastly, students have to follow the rules and listen to teachers daily, as a result the students wont be able to learn when to make decisions for them selves if they the teachers are always telling them what to do. Students need to know when to make the decision to stay or not stay, not to be forced.\n \n Lastly, some kids dont like to do extra things like playing games or sports at school because it will make them very sweaty and sticky, the principle is also forcing them to stay. An addition, since the principle is not giving the students a choice they wont like it, but If there was a option that the kids could choose then it would be more enjoyable because they can choose when they want to stay or not stay. Lastly most students like to kick back and relax and spend some time inside their home. I personally would like to be home sometimes after school and watch some movies and fall asleep if I can.\n \n In conclusion, I disagree with with this statement because, it's not fair for a student to be forced into staying after to do extracurricular activities. It's also not right to be forced to stay, especially if a student had to take care of personal business like taking care of family. Principles should already know what could go on at a house, so they need to be more reasonable when it comes toÂ adding on to a persons schedule.

        "Your principal has decided that students are required to take at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree with this? I agree with this because you may want to stay interested in any of your schools activities. It is important because students want to stay active with there schools and the best way by doing that is by having something for students to experience. Schools have activities for students to do after schoolÂ because they want them to stay active. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students gain responsibility, helps get students motivated, benefit their college and job application.\n \n First things first, having extracurricular activities can help students gain responsibility because in some cases students will be doing things that take someone with responsibility to do. For example, students that are in sports are responsible for having the appropriate shoes and clothes for their practices. This is one reason why activities, that certain schools have, are important. This will motivate students to do better and they would want to succeed in whatever they are doing. This leads me to my second reason.\n \n Secondly, it could help students get motivated to do better in school. This is important because extracurricular activities require you to have good grades and if you like one of the activities you are doing you will be motivated to do good so that you can stay in it. This can allow tons of students to be successful in school and they will try hard in school. Students might want to do certain activities that require them to have good grades and if they don't then they can't do it. This is why in order to do what you like you need to do good in school and it is very important to do good in school.\n \n Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit you when you are trying to apply for a job or just trying to get into a college of your choice. The first thing is that it may help you look good when putting whatever you did on your paper. For example, someone can put they did track and then they got an award for winning a competition, that would make their paper look good. Another example is that if you want to get a specific job and you are in a certain club were they teach you about the job could really benefit you. Like stated in the previous paragraph, it could help you take care of your grades and if you do have good grades colleges would want you. This could help you in the long run because it is important to have some experience with what job you want. Extracurricular activities can help you get to know how you feel about this and if you want to do this in the future.\n \n In conclusion many students need to be responsible in order to keep the activity they want. Students will become motivated to do better so that they can stay in that certain activity. Students will have the experience and they will be able to get the job that they want. These reasons prove on why it is important to have extracurricular activities. This is why I agree on how students should be entitled to at least on activity because it helps students gain responsibility, helps students get students motivated, and it helps students on their job application and college application.

Wanting a break but never able to since its for a grade, well your principal has decided that you can participate in an activity you might like! You can be in a sport, work on the yearbook, or even serve in the student council! I for sure love this idea! It helps kids look forward to something that might not be as tiring and boring as the subjects of schools, run around in basketball, be creative in art class, be inspirational as you work on the yearbook, or help others and the principals being a part of the student council! It all helps in the school system and you might make a change, for example, Generic_Name, a senior in one of the highest ranks high schoolÂ in Japan, was a student councilor that helped hundreds of students from doing a bad choice, grades, or just be someone to talk to. The principal has announcementÂ that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity, and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school.\n \n First, it'll make you look forward about something during your day. You might have had a bad day but then you might remember that you're going to maybe you favorite topic class and that might brighten up you day a lot more. It'll be like a small break you get other then lunch. You get to talk with your friends and maybe even your favorite teacher and learn new tactics in the class you might like. A moment class where you can relax and hang out and get grade in too! A lot of high schools, if not all, let you pick the class you wanna be in and you may have other choices too. It's a matter of your and luck but always worth it.\n \n Second, I'll be talking about how you might socialize more. You might not get what I'mÂ saying so I'll just straight up say it, you don't always have to be quiet unless, of course, the teacher is talking. You get to be in groups and learn from each other and depending on what your doing you will get a different pack. For example, if you were to be in a basketball team, you going to see different cons and pros onÂ each player but you'll all will have toÂ work with each other to accomplish you goal, if your working on the yearbook you will all have to speak to each other and work on the same task to show that sometimes two people make a better job then one. It can help you boost up your social skills and your skills with working with others even if you've never met them. Socializing its a big stage in our life that some areÂ very afraid ofÂ and others not at all and this types of things will help you in case if you wanna make a business or be a doctor or police officer or anything, but communication is always the key that you wanna use.\n \n Thirdly, this class may be the best of each year your in high school, you never know. It can be that class you'll always talk to your friends about after you graduate and have memories of. The class that brightened up your whole high school year into one of the amazing years ever, the one class that when ever you pass your old high school or have to speak about it thats the fist thing that comes into mind. That one class that cleared you mind and helped you with drama and other skills you might have needed to learn.\n \n In conclusion,Â the principal has announcement that is best if everyone has to join at least one extracurricular activity,and so I have come into the conclusion on how I'll show you on why I agree with this choice. I'll make you have something to look forward to each day after a tiring subject, make you be able to socialize more and not always have a standardized test that you might know, and finally how it will change your whole year and make you have something to talk about after you graduate high school. This essay will help you understand why sometimes even having another extra class might help you in the future or at that exact moment.",

        "Can you believe that schools are now making students stay after-school to participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with schools having students participate in one extracurricular activity becasuse students need time for other activities outside of school, students need time with their families, and they need time to do their homework.\n \n Many students love coming home right when the school bell rings and having the rest of the day to do what they like. This is not the case at some schools. At my school our principal is having us participate in one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this because students need time to play and practice sports such as basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer. Students also need time to hang out with their friends not just inside of school, but outside too. If a student is forced to stay after-school and there is nothing they like there than it may bother the students emotions and make them sad. If a student is sad or upset about this it may affect their participation, attendence, and effort. I do not want kids spending more time than they have to at school.\n \n There are a ton of students who do not get to see their family at all due to school. Students need time to be with their family and socialize with them like playing a board game or having a nice conversation. Extracurricular activities may interfere with the time that kids have to spend with their families. It is very important that kids spend time with their families because it keeps their mental health well, keeps them in line, and provides comfort for them. It keeps their mental health stable because they do not worry about seeing their parents or when they will see their parents again. It keeps them in line because they have somebody to tell them what is ok and what is not ok and they have somebody to discipline them. It provides comfort for kids because they know somebody or some group of people are there for them. If students had no time to spend with their family it would most likely casue many problems for them.\n \n Did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen.\n \n Once again, I believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework. If time that students have for these activities gets taken away by school it may lead to something bad. If you do not agree with me please think about this again and if you do agree with me that is great because you are thinking the right way.",

        "I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.\n \n Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and\n \n Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.\n \n There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.\n \n If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",

        "Generic_Name is making the whole school participate in at leastÂ one after school sport. Although most kids arent happy with this i certainly am!\n \n I agree that you should participate in at least one activity after school because, its good exercise for you, its only one activity and its a break from watching TV all day and being on your phone.\n \n The first reason you should do an after school activity is because, its good exercise, doing an after school sport can make you a healthy person because of the constant movement and running you do in most sports. For example sumo wrestlers usually lose up to 30,000 calories a day which is insane isnt it. You dont know how much impact a sport has on your health. Another example of sports being good exercise for you is when your constantly at practice in you do drills like running or in ice hockey when you move around back and fourth, or when in wrestling your sprawling and consistently moving. Stuff like that is the best exercise you can get these days. Or even if its not a sport it can be exercise, when your just walking you are burning calories. everything you do burns calories, even breathing.\n \n Moving on to my second reason on why you should do an after school activity is because its only one activity you have to do. Its not like its for 3 hours everyday of the year. Its not a huge birdin you have to do, its probably only like an hour and 30 mins a day or less for only like a season. But if your that lazy just do something simple and easy that dosent last long at all. Then you'll get your one activity you have to do out of the way so you can spend the rest of your year after school how you would like. The only reason i see you can't stay after school for an activity is because your family needs you everyday after school, or you have a little brother to take care of, things like that. If anything it might motivate you to do more activities after school, or join a league outside of school. All ImÂ saying is its only a little bit of time out of your day so dont sweat it.\n \n My Finale reason why i agree you should do at leastÂ one after school activity is because it gets you away from your phone. Instead looking on instagram and checking out snap chat. Your in the real world doing something instead of posting a selfie for the internet. While your staying after school to do an activity some lazy guy at home is just playing video games in his basement which is not helping him out, or getting the exercise he needs. Plus one day your not gonna be able to do this. Your just gonna sit in a cubical all day working on stuff and doing papers from 9 am to 5 pm. But you seriously need this because you can't be on your phone or the internet for the rest of your life.\n \n In Conclusion i agree that we all should do one sport or activity after school because in reality its good exercise, dosent take that long and its better then looking at your phone. It wont kill you to do a sport and its not that hard. You'll be find doing an after school activity. Once the season is over for the sport your doing then your done, you've gotten it over withÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â",

After school students might can't do after school do to family problems, stressed, or just don't want to do those things. I also disagree because you can't force a person who dosen't want to do something you want them to do for after school.\n \n family problems, a lotÂ of student go through alot when it comes to family and just don't have the time because earthier something tradect happened or someone in there family died and thats hard on student when it comes to a family member dyeing or something bad happens. some students dont also have the time because there parent have to work and the student has to watch its brother or sister and just cant saty after school because of that. Student Can't stay after school because there parents need help around the house after school and sometimes they don't have a ride to get home or they don't have a bus to ride.\n \n After school a lotÂ of student are stressed because of school work, grades and homework. At school you sometimes a lotÂ of classes and you just get really stressed because you can't keep up with the school work. Grades are a big factor at school because without good grades you sometimes can't do the stuff you want to and the grade affects some of your stuff. homework some kids dont have the time to stay after school because they have a lotÂ of homework and sometimes home work affects your after school activities. Stressed is one of the biggest factors of not wanting to do after school.\n \n Some students are not good at a lotÂ of thing like sports, or clubs or they just dont like those things.

        "Did you know that one out of every four schools don't let students participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that this is unfair and students should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Imagine not being able to participate in many fun skill-learning activities.\n \n While others believe that participating in an extracurricular activity is a waste of time, I believe that it is not.\n \n I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity for reasons such as, it will make school a better place for students to be in, it will be a chance for students to make more friends or meet new people and kids will improve their skills or learn new skills.\n \n Extracurricular activities will make school a better place for students to attend. It will also encourage kids to want to go to school everyday because they will be looking forward to that one or more extracurricular activity. Many kids don't want to attend school everyday because they have so much things going on like homework, projects, tests etc. Extracurricular activities will help relief the stress many kids go through everyday, it will get their mind off all the things going on at home. When I was having a bad day at school, I always remembered that I was going to stay after schoolÂ for Art club that day and that cheered me up.\n \n Extracurricular activities will also be the chance for students to make friends and meet new people. It is most likely the kids you meet in that extracurricular activity will be interesting in the same thing as you are. For example if you meet someone that likes and plays the same sport as you, you guys will have something in common. One time I attended the Spanish Culture club and I met a lot of new people that I had in common with, everyone spoke Spanish and was from South America.\n \n Extracurricular activities will improve kids skills or teach them new skills. It is good for a kid to know many skills because it will help them later in life, it doesn't hurt to learn new skills or to improve them. When I joined my school's dance team I learned a lot of new skills, for example turns, jumps, new choreography etc. I also improved how flexible I was and how far I could do my splits. By the end of the school year I learned how to properly do my splits and also some jumps. Joining the dance team really helped me in a lot of ways.\n \n In conclusion, I agree with the principal, all students should participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity for reasons such as it will make school a better environment and a better place in general, it will be a chance for students to make more friends and meet more people and kids will improve some previous skills they have or they will learn new skills.Â",

        "Imagine living in a world where you had to do every single activity. I disagree that all students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree because not everybody has time to do activities. Most kids are still in school and get homework and have to study for test and can't ever do activities.\n \n Here are some of my reasons why I disagree. Parents have to work. See not all parents have the time to be driving there kid places if they're busy at home or at work. Some parents have to work late so they can have money. Parents have a lot of responsibilities.\n \n Reasons why we don't have time to do extracurricular activities is because they cost a lot of money. I used to do gymnastics when I was younger but I had to quit because my mom didn't always have the money to pay for it. I was so upset when I figured out I had to quit but I was strong because I can always do it again in the future. So sometimes our parents are struggling and we can't help but to quit. Just because our parents don't have time or money to do it now doesn't mean we can't do what we love in the future.\n \n Don't forget about us kids! We have tons of work to do at school and have to study and sometimes projects for school and its so overwhelming! If we have so much to do how could we ever to do an extracurricular activity! Doing extracurricular activities can also take up the time that you might just want to yourself. Some people don't even like doing activities which means they would but doing they're not happy doing and it's not fun to do something you don't like. These are my reasons why I don't think that all students need to do at least one extracurricular activity.",

        "You just got home from school and you relax for a while then you are going to study and do homework. But you are forced by your school to do a sport or be in the student council so now you have less time to study. I think that student should not have to do something outside of school if they don't want to like playing a sport or working on the year book.\n \n First being forced to work on something you don't want to do can put more stress on kids. Lets say if you are forced to play a sport and you have no athletic ability and you hate that sport with a passion it can make you miserable, you have to spend a lot of time with a sports team and that can really be bad if you don't like it. If a kid cant get his homework done because of something he is forced to do that can also put a lot of stress on kids not being able to get work done. If kids are forced to do something they hate it can really have a negative effect on them and their grades.\n \n Also having to do other stuff outside of school that you don't want to do can take away from them having fun and playing with friends. Many kids now don't get outside as much as kids used to, and having them trapped not being able to do what they want can take away from them being kids. Having kids not being able to hang out with friends can make them not as happy and they can lack good social skills. You can see that forcing kids to do stuff they shouldn't have to do is a bad thing, this can suck for the kids if they have to do this.\n \n However getting kids to do other stuff can help them get off there screens. Kids are playing video gamesÂ way too much these days and getting them a new activity can help get them off. Playing a sport could help kids loose weight and be more fit so they are not unhealthy. This can be good but, making a kid play a sport they don't want to do can make it so they don't try in the sport and don't give any effort because they don't like it. No one wants to play a sport they are not good at. This is why kids should not be forced to do something they don't need to do.\n \n Now you can see how making kids do something they don't need to do is bad. I think schools should not make kids do something school related that doesn't count towards grades. I hope schools don't do this and that kids can just be themselves.",

        "Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities are very important, not only to your health, but to your fututre. Colleges have started looking into extracurricular activities more now then before. Not to mention how much fun they can be.\nCollege is important. It helps set you up for your job and 'adult readiness', but first, you have to get into college. Applications are important, they are a main factor in getting into college, but I wouldn't neccesarily call it your 'make or break'. Grades are exceedingly important when applying for college, but extracurricular activities are just as important. Extracurricular activities can help show that you can commit to something, follow through with it, and you might be very good at it. The more extracurricular activities, the better. For example, let's say an A average student who did no extracurricular activities applies for a college. Another B average student who did one or two extracurricular activities applies for the same college. The B average student is more likely to make it into the college than the A\naverage student because of their extracurricular activities.\nExtracurricular activities can mean many things. It can mean sports, clubs, volunteering, and many more. Sports are well-known to be good for your health. It helps you exercise and stay in good shape. Laziness, especial in teenagers nowadays, is very common. Being required to move and exercise would do our health and body good. Even if we don't do a sport and we chose a club. Clubs normally make you exercise your brain and make you think in a different way than school usually requires you to.\nFinally, it can be fun! Many people who do extracurricular activites found that they liked a certain activity more than others. I, for one, have that expieriance. I tried many sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, swimming, and ballet. I thouroughly enjoyed swimming, baseball, and ballet. However, I didn't do baseball. Now, I'm on pointe in my ballet and going on to my eleventh year of dance and my summer swim team was the Division and Finals champions. I love my extracurricular activities and I feel as though my life would be fairly boring without them.\nThere are so many benefits in doing extracurricular activities and being required to participate is merely helping you get the leg up on your future. In the end, it's all worth it, every bit. It does so much good in your life that you won't even relise it until your older. Therefore, I agree and support the principal in their decision.",

        "If you had to participate in an extracurricular activity, what would you choose to do? You have to pick because the principal said all of the students in the school have to participate. You may have reasons to not do it, but there are some reasons why you should. The main reason is you might actually like it and enjoy whatever activity you choose. So,Â I agree because some people may need the extra activity, others might wanna be more active, and some people may just wanna have fun.\nSome students may need an extra activity. One reason is they may want to be more confident or build their self-esteem. They might want to step out of their comfort zone, and also may be trying to impress someone. The person might also need help with something important to them. They may be struggling education wise and are searching for help. They might need help with a sport or hobby of theirs.\nStudents may be trying to be more active. They might be trying to get and stay fit. This student might want to become a stronger person than before. This person might want to get abs or build up stamina. It might be a goal for them to be a healthier person. It'll be better for their body in general. They'll be able to last longer while stretching and running.\nMost importantly, students simply just want to have fun. Students want to learn something new and exciting. They might want to learn how to play certain sports or games. They just want to have a good time playing together. They might want to play against other teams. The thrill of racing against time trying to get more points is amazing! It's also rewarding to have a victory in something.\nBased on those reasons, I see the point of having students be involved in an extracurricular activity. It's important and you could have some fun while doing so. It's not a punishment, it's probably to make sure you're getting energy, learning something new, playing a sport, or joining a club. Since you could have fun, may need the extra activity, and you may want to be more active, I agree with this decision.",

        "Hello my name is Generic_Name. I am here because I am giving my opinion on whether students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity. I think that it would be good for students in many ways, so keep reading if you want to find out why.\nForcing students to join extracurricular activities is a good idea, one reason is that they might make new friends. This could happen because they would find other kids in they're group who enjoy the same things. Having friends makes school a lotÂ easier and more fun. An extra bonus to having friends is that it is less likely for you to get bullied because you will have people to back you up. Even outside of school having friends is good. Like if you want to play basketball but you arent on a team, well boom! you could go to a court with your friends to run some games. In many ways having friends around will impact your life in good ways.\nAnother good reason for having to do activities is you could find out that your really good at something. Like, what if you could play a mean harmonica without even knowing it? You wouldn't have a clue unless you signed up for an extra activity. You might even be a good chess player. Im pretty good at chess and I wouldnt have known that unless I played a quick game with a friend. You could even make new friends with your newly discovered skills. Some activities can help you later in life, like if you need to knit a rope because you got lost in a forest, or you need to know how to jump start a car because it broke down on the side of the road, well no problem you already know how to do it because of the activity.\nYou could have a lot of fun doing some activities. Having fun is important because you dont want to have suicidal thoughts or depression. Being depressed could easily lead to bad grades and poor choices. Having fun is good because your life will just be better. You can do tons of things to have fun or be happy. Maybe your fun is reading, well then you could sign up for a book club. I have fun playing sports like basketball, or baseball. I like getting fresh air, so I play outside a lot. Again, having fun is so important it makes you want to try more things. Having fun can make people like you more so it could lead to you getting more friends, and having friends is also very important.\nOK! I have given my opinion on why every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities. I definitely think it would help out tons of kids to do it.

        "I disagree in having to make students participateÂ in a sport, or extracurricular activity. Not all students enjoy playing sports or participating in a school activity. Not many parents have the time or money to put their kids in such either, and its also putting more stress on kids during and after school if having to join one.\nWhen being forced to do something such as a sport or school activity the school has to find a variety of the kids liking. Making sure all the kids in his school have a place to have fun at and not just something they have to do and dont enjoy. Having all kids in something at a school can cause running into dept because thats a lotÂ of kids you have to put money towards. Sports can run as much as two to a hundred dollars per kid for any sport, and when having to be forced into a sport that you dont enjoy why waist money. Even when the kids dont want to participate why even try putting your hard working money towards it.\nSports and activities for school are not free. The school has to buy equipment and tools for those opportunities and, sometimes not all parents can physically do that. Sports are a lotÂ of money and when having to be put into one not knowing how you are going to pay for it can be embarrassing. Letting your kid down is the least a father or mother would ever want to do, and when working in the school board having to deal with phone callsÂ from parents saying they cant afford a extracurricular activity would be heartbreaking.\nKids work really hard to put forth effort on school work,homework, and participate in school projects. That can be already enough stress on a kid no matter what age. When having to put another thing on top of school work managing time for sports, and extra activities sometimes kids just cant deal with it. Grades and having a good GPA can come first for some kids. Sports and other things come last. You could probrobaly already have something after school you do and having to move your whole schedule around can be really tiring and stressful.\nThis is why I disagree on having to make kids participate in a sport or activity. Its way to much work, stress, and money. So when coming down to a decisionÂ I agree with a no because having every kid in a sport or activity is absurd.Â",

        "My principle has decided that she wants everyone to participate in a extracurricular activity. In my opinion, I believe it's the best for students to participate in school activity. It will be a great way to have fun, make new friends, and get some exercise.\nMaking new friends is not always easy. Many kids now judge you by the way you dress, act or even look. For example, I was a new girl at a school. It wasn't very easy to make any friends so I decided to stay after school and join a club. As I was joining a club, I got paired up with a girl who was in the same grade as me.\nAt first, it was awkward but then we started conversations and we found many things in common. One thing that we found in common was that we both love dancing. Since then, we have been very close friends until this day. Participating in a activity was the best thing I did to be able to make new friends from a new school.\nAnother reason why students should join a activity is to maintain your health. According to WWW.stay. healthy. com, has stated that participating in a club or activity at least an hour per day is very important for your health. It is also a great way to distract yourself from any anxiety or stress you are facing. Everyday my sister would come home from school. She would always be overwhelmed with the amount of homework she had to do and complain about how much her neck and back was hurting. It was a hard time she was facing and my mom decided to take her to the doctors. Our Doctor, said that her body was hurting because she didn't get any excersice and she also wasn't participating in any activity to distract her. The next day, my sister decided to try out for volleyball. She was great and made the team. By joining volleyball, it helped her feel free because she was distracted by everything negative she was facing.\nJoining a activity doesn't have to be boring or all about running . Activities are meant for you to pick them and do something fun you love. There are many activities to choose from. For example, I love doing pottery. My mom and I would go to a building where they would teach you how to make cups, any animal, and vases. It makes your hands messy but it was so much fun. Next year, for high school there is a class where anyone can take and it is called ceramics. I am beyond excited to take a class where I'm going to do something that will distract me but at the same time I will be doing something that is fun for me. When given the chance to participate in any activity, it is a great way to pick something you know will be enjoyable.\nAs a result, by participating in a activity it helps you maintain your health, have fun, and meet new people. At first, starting something new can take a couple tries until you get it right. In addition, once you learn it is the best feeling ever to accomplish something new. After learning it will become easy and fun because you will already know what to do.\nIt is also a great way to meet new people and make friends who love the same thing you do. Activities help you feel distracted and calm because you are doing something you love and no one is judging you from it. These are my reasons on why I strongly believe that everyone should participate in a extracurricular activity.",

        "Some people might think after school actives are fun and some think not. Some principals think it is required for students to have an after school activity without thinking about how the students feel about after school actives. Students should have the right to choose weather to have and after school activity or not. Students should not have to participate in a extracurciuar activity after school because some students do not have the time, Not a student would like to be forced to do a after school activity, And not all students like to have an after school activity.\nAfter a long day at school some students do not have the time to do an after school activity. They could have after school plans and can not do the activity they were supposed to do. Others have lots of homework to do after school although teachers say that would be a terrible excuse to say but every teacher does not know how much homework the kids have after they're class. Students after school might have to take care of a younger sibling or pet because their mother or father is at work or they could be doing something to help out their mother or father.\nIn many occasions students are force to do an after school activity chosen by the school district. Students are more likely to do the activity if they are to chose it instead of the school district. Because of the students disliking the activity they were assigned they would most likely to skip it and go on with they're day. so instead of forcing students to do an activity have options for them so they can pick for themselves.\nSome students just do not like after schoolÂ actives and they do not have a reason why they just don't. The students would rather study for and up coming test or quiz. They are stay at home kids they go to school and come back home to do whatever they need to do to pass school. Their is no explanation but they just dislike actives after school and if they do not like it then they should not be force to do something they do not want to do. they want to take the time to study and pass the grade instead of doing an after school activity.\nAfter school actives can be every difficult to do for some students because some dont have the time, they would not like to be forced to do it,and some kids just do not like it at all. These are just some reasons on why not give after school actives to students but there are many more, people just do not think about how busy the life of a student is.Â",

        "Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like? Well you came to the right school, cause the principalÂ made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like.\nYou could play on a basketball team\nYou could play on a football team\nYou could play on a flag football team\nYou could play on a baseball team\nYou could play on a softball team\nYou could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team\nI agree with theÂ principalÂ because, when we get home we don't doÂ anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future.\nSo if you don't agree with me, I'll give more reasons like kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friendsÂ while they're after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high schoolÂ sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.\nIt is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did.\nIf your not interested in sports you could do other afters schoolÂ activities like\nBook club\nYearbook club\nDance club\nCooking club\nComputer club\nStudent council\nEngineering club\nYou could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home.\nBut if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.\nIf you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit theÂ teacherÂ you will get expelled.\nIf your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.\nIf you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friendÂ over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend throughÂ basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.\nMost likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no oneÂ knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.\nSo what we know is that joining an after schoolÂ program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could joinÂ for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Imagine that you have a job after school, right after school goes out. But your school now requires you to take an extracurricular activity. You get fired from that job and all because of your school. This is what would happen to many people if schools mandated after school activities. I pick up my brother from his bus stop every day and if I had after school activities there would be no-one to pick him up. I think schools should not force students to take an extracurricular because of Jobs, People, and Time.\nOne of the reasons schools should not force students to take an extracurricular is Jobs. Some students have jobs after school. They might have to work to help support their family. If you made them take after school activities then they wont be able to make it to work on time most of the time and get fired. Nothing good would come of that situation.\nAnother reason is people like friends or family. As I said before, I pick my brother up from his bus stop every day. I also have friends that need to do the same thing. My mom has to go to work and my dad works from home so I'm the only one that can pick him up all the time. Same thing with my friend who also picks his brother up every day. If either of us had to do an extracurricular we wouldnt be able to pick up our siblings. Students also have plans after school with their friends, or maybe they are going on a trip with family. If they where forced into anÂ extracurricularÂ they would not have as much time to hang out with their friends or go places with family. They might be late to wherever they were going.\nThe last reason is time.Â Some students just simply dont have enough time every day to do an extracurricular. They might have clubs after school, or they might play on a sports team. Not everyone has that much free time after school. They have homework, eat, spend time on hobbies, etc. But an extracurricular takes another couple hours out of your day, thats less time to do all those things.\nThere are also arguments for students being forced into an extracurricular but I feel like students should have a choice because everyone is under different circumstances.\nCard Stacking\nWhether you have a job, a sibling to pick up, or plans with friends, you could be stopped from doing any of those things by the mandating of extracurricular activities.\nCall to Action\nSo next time you have a chance to influence a decision about this topic, make sure you make it so that there are no forced after school activities.\nRestate Thesis\nThat's why I think you should not make students take extracurricular.",

        "Have you ever struggled in a certain activity, or just wanted to join a new club.\nMany students often feel that way and don't know what to do, but there are many after school clubs that help out in that regard. Students who are struggling in certain subject could stay after school with a teacher to help in that situation. Many schools also provide sport clubs so that students interested would join, and possible lend them a scholarship into collage. Students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to make stronger bonds with others. With so many benefits to staying after school, I believe that students should stay after school in at least one club.\nThere are many instances in which students struggle to keep high grades up, and don't know what to do. There are many extracurricular activities that may help in that scenario. Students can find clubs in which they can get help by teachers to do work there struggling to finish.\nIf a student missed a day of school and can't catch up, teachers can stay after and show them and important information that they missed. Tests can bring stress to students , and even make them panic a little, when that happens students can request thatÂ teacher help them and even give tips on how to relax and focus. Trying to juggle so many things at once can be difficult for most students, but teachers are there to help out those in need.\nSport clubs are one of the most popular clubs in some schools, and for good reason. Clubs like these offer students a chance to play the sport they like and represent the school at the same time. Sport clubs also give participantsÂ the opportunity to hang out with friends and create new ones along the way.

        '""Mom,"" Generic_Name whimpered sadly. ""Why is it so hard to make friends in school?"" Her mother moves slowly towards the edge of her daughters bed and grabs her hand. ""Now sweetie,"" her mother says comfortingly. ""I\'m sure if you tried hard enough you could make friends with someone."" Crying softly Generic_Name turns toward her mother and says angrily, ""It\'s not that easy mom! I don\'t have anything to talk about with these people. We don\'t even like the same things!"" sighing her mother pulls her in for a hug, ""oh honey, I\'m so sorry. I had no idea."" Generic_Name\'s mother can\'t do anything but rock her sobbing child as she cries .\nThis is a sad reality for many kids, throughout all stages of schooling, they have difficulties making friends and often end up feeling isolated and lonely. This problem can be easily solved by school principals requiring students participate in at least one extracurricular activity like a club or a sport. These extracurricular activities would help encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue a passion or hobby, and give each otherÂ opportunities to learn more about themselves while expressing their personal interests and talents.\nThe first reason schools should make extracurricular activities a requirement is because they would encourage students to be more social with their peers. As a student with social anxiety I know how difficult it can be to try and talk to people and make friends, but in my experience i\'ve noticed that clubs and sports give students more confidence in themselves. An extracurricular activity, whether it be a sport or a club, is an 3 and easy way for a student to put them selfÂ out there with people who share their interests. For example when I first started school it was hard for me to talk to people and I didn\'t have many friends, then one day my language arts teacher encouraged me to try out for our school track team. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a chance, and it ended up being one of the smartest decisions I had made that year. After making the team I steadily came more and more out of my shell with the motivation of my teammates. I built strong friendships with many of the girls on my team solely because of the interest that bonded us together, our love for running. Joining track made me more confident in myself, and taught me how to make and maintain unbreakable friendships.\nMy second piece of reasoning as to why schools should require extracurricular activities, is because they would urge students to try new things and become interested in different hobbies. During the years students are in school, their hobbies are constantly evolving at a rapid pace, and they often become interested in things they had never acknowledged before. This example is true to many people, including myself. After track season had ended I decided I wanted to join an after schoolÂ club, but none of the options really caught my eye. After searching for awhile a friend from the track team asked if I would be interested in joining our school robotics club as her teammate. As I had no other options that jumped out to me, I decided to try joining. Since joining the club in my sixth grade year I\'ve developed a passion for engineering and computer programming that I never would have imagined developing otherwise. Taking that one chance to join the club has turned my previous skills and new ideas into a passion I doubt I\'ll ever lose.\nThe final reason that extracurricularÂ activities should be required is that being in a club or sport would assist students in discovering more about themselves. In many cases people find out new things about themselves while participating in a club. It could be simple things such as unknown talents, or as complicated as realizing their social position on a team. When I first joined robotics in my sixth grade year, I was what you would describe as a follower. But when our team captain was out because of a concussion and my team was falling apart, we found out that I was, as described by my coach, ""A natural born leader."" Even being the unsociable person I am, I was able to lead my team with no assistance for three weeks, with a strength I wasn\'t sure I had. After this discovery I was promoted by my coach to be a team captain. For the last three years I have been the captain of my team, and as this is my final year considering I\'m an eighth grader, my coach decided to test my skills. The past four months I have been captain and supervisor of three different teams by his order. I realize as I look back I never would have learned this about myself without joining robotics club.\n""MOM!"" Elise shouts excitedly as she rushes through the front door, ""WE WON!"" from her place in the kitchen her mother lets out a whoop of surprise before running to join her daughter in the living room. Surrounded by her teammates Elise holds the 1st place trophy up proudly as she laughs. The house is filled with the joyous laughter of Elise and her friends from the soccer club. As the girls chat between themselves Elise\'s mother looks on with a smile, proud of her daughter for finding friends that made her happy. Making eye contact with Elise she shouts, ""All right, Group picture!"" Lining up with large smiles on their faces and arms aroundÂ each other, the girls look into the camera with happiness evident on their faces. The snap of the camera ensures this memory will always have a special place in Elise\'s heart.\nWithout having joined an extracurricular activity Elise would never have had the opportunity to make the bonds and friendships she did. Being in a club or sport helps encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue new hobbies, and give each otherÂ opportunities to learn more about themselves and express their interests. Reasons such as these are why I agree that principles at all schools should make the decision requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Â Â Â',

Sports aren't the only option though, there are clubs like chess club, student council, yearbook or debate. This is a good chance for Generic_Name to make some friends. Many students don't do anything after school. If the students don't have an extracurricular activity then they seem less active with other people. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it keeps the students off their electronic devices, makes the students more active with others, and it helps the students to stay out of trouble.\nFirst, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it will keep the students off their electronic devices. People today are very absorbed in their devices. Apps like Instagram, TikÂ Tok, Facebook, and YouTube keep people entertained for hours. When students dont have an extracurricular activity then they are more likely to get on their devices for many hours. If students were to go to an extracurricular activity then they could be more involved in the real world and not crammed inside there house on their phone for hours.\nSecond, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it makes the students more active with other people. Many people struggle with interacting with others, but an extracurricular activity can help students to meet new people. Being in an extracurricular activity will help students to make new friends. Most of these activities require students to interact so they will have to make friends. Having friends in school makes their time there more enjoyable. Going out of the students comfort zone is a part of life they are going to have to do things that make them uncomfortable.\nLast, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it helps the students stay out of trouble. Students are more likely to get into trouble when the aren't in a extracurricular activity because, they may get bored and just go and make some bad decisions. Many students feel peer pressure to do bad things. Extracurricular activities can help create a positive influence on people. Students sometimes feel like they have to be like this or be like that but, the students just need to be themselves.\nJust like Generic_Name students can explore new activities to make friends. Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it keeps the students off their electronic devices, makes the students more active with others, and it helps the students to stay out of trouble. Push students to join these extracurricular activities so they can explore what they like to do, and what they dont like to do. If students never get out of their comfort zone then that wont get anywhere in life. Extracurricular activities are good for the students.

These scenarios are some activities that students participate in and find joy in doing. Many students try school related activities and result in being very passionate about them. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows them to learn life skills, help find a better activity they could enjoy, and make new friends.\nInvolving students in at least one extracurricular activity would allow them to learn new life skills. For example, if a student were to join Debate Team, they would learn how to properly debate against one another and find evidence to support their arguments. Another example would include sport activities. If a student were to take part in a sport at school, it would teach them about competition. When participating in sports many play to win and the game could get intense. This shows the players competitiveness. Also, if students were to serve in student council, they would learn how to be a leader. Students who are in student council participate in the meetings and come up with good ideas for the school. In life, this skill will be useful because it teaches students how to become a good leader. Students learn all kinds of different skills in extracurricular activities that could be useful later on in life.\nSome students have trouble finding activities they enjoy doing. However, there are many options to choose from when trying to find the right extracurricular activity. Within all of the choices, students could find one they are interested in. For example, when I was looking for a school related activity, it was easy to choose one that I would enjoy because there were so many options that interested me. I chose to run for student council and I have enjoyed my time as an officer. Additionally, many people try to figure out what they want to do in the future around their high school or middle school years. Participating in an extracurricular activity could help someone decide what they want their occupation to be because of an interest in an activity. To add, if a student is interested in one specific activity, they might want to join more that are similar since they share common interest. Finding one activity for a student could lead to them finding many new interests.\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity would also help students make new friends. For example, when doing a team activity, students learn teamwork. Most students find someone they work well with within a group of people and it could eventually turn into a friendship. Also, while working with a group, some people find others that share common interests with them. Most friendships work because they share similar interests in certain things. Additionally, activities are always more fun when you can do them with friends. For instance, when I play basketball independently, I am less motivated and I get bored faster. Whereas when I'm with my friends, my energy is higher and there's more to do. Overall, making new friends is always possible when doing an activity.\nTo conclude, taking part in at least one activity teaches you many different life skills without even knowing it, some students try one activity and find new interests along the way, and while working with others, students develop friendships. All of these advantages lead to a fun and educational experience.Â",

      essay:
        "Extracurricular activities, such as playing sports, instruments, and joining after school clubs are highly encouraged by adults and teachers for growing adolecents. Recently, the principal of the Generic_School stated all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe forcing students to join a club activity will be unnecessary, unproductive, and inefficient considering the cost and the effort. There is not enough data and evidence to ensure that all students will like their activities, it will create a fair cooperation and competition environment among diverse groups of students, and finally to prove that every student will enjoy extracurricular activities.\nMy first argument is that it will force students to participate in an activity that they might not enjoy which is unhealthy. My current school, Generic_School, does not have unlimited budget, faculty members, and space for different club activities. With very limited resources, the school will much prefer to establish more popular clubs than smaller clubs. Options that the school offer may not serve everyone's interest, but students will still need to choose an unappealing activity because it is mandotary. For example, when I was at a camp last summer, I was asked to choose five different activities. However, they did not offer all the courses I wanted and I ended up joining the swimming class which is my least favorite sport. From my own personal experience, I concern how some students might lose their interests or end up disliking their chosen clubs activities.\nSecondly, the plan seems unfair for certain group of students and will develop an unhealthy competition environment. It will simply create a disparity betweeen students who can afford private lessons or tutorings to get better at the activity and those who cannot. For example, a clarinet player who receives private lessons and plays in a local band will be able to perform much harder music and eventually be placed in a more advanced band than his peers who cannot afford the cost. This allows an environment where certain group of students will continue to get better and others cannot. Not only will it pressure the students with unnecessary stress, but it will also burden their parents financially.\nLastly and most importantly, it does not necessary have to be an extracurricular activity as far as the students are passionate about the activity. For example, some people might be passionate about learning foreign languages and cultures or solving creative math problems which are not considered extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are meant to help students find their hobbies and interests. However, for students who already have hobbies that are not necessary defined as an extracurricular activity, such as reading books or writing creative stories, it is not right to force them to do something that they are not interested in when they have already found their interests. Everyone is born with different talent and interest. For instance, I enjoy public speaking and joined the Generic_School Debate team, whereas others might fear giving speechs in front of their classmates during civics class. Extracurricular activities may not be the best option for all students.\nAlthough extracurricular activities are known to promote adolecents' overall well-being in general, there seems to be more disadvantages than benefits to this plan. Because the school board has limited resources to offer, it will be practically difficult to make extracurricular activities mandotary and ensure all students could benefit from this plan. We also cannot make sure that everyone will like the activities and create health and only necessary competition among the students. I value some benefits of this proposal but believe that it is more disadvantageous towards students and that is the reason why I disagree with this plan.Â Â",

        'Trudge,Trudge.\nGeneric_Name\'s feet dragged on the concrete as he sighed, walking into the school.Â The building towered over him while casting a gloomy, grayÂ shadow. As he entered the school, Generic_Name\'s so called ""friends"" ignored him and talked behind his back. He had known for a while that his friends hated him, but Generic_Name hadn\'t had the chance to gain better friends. The boys approached Generic_Name and start ranting about how stupid he was. This was the last straw. ""I\'m done with you guys!"" Generic_Name yelled, and stormed off. ""Fine with us,"" one of his old friends said. Now friendless and depressed,Â Generic_Name wished the school day could be over as he trudged off to his first class.\n""Alright class,"" Generic_Name\'s teacher said while students entered the room, ""Can anyone answer this question?"" No one made a sound. Everyone stared at the teacher pointing to the equation on the board. It was so quiet, you could hear the pin drop from Generic_Name\'s desk. Generic_Name knew the answer, but he was scared to answer. Generic_Name\'s teacher sighed. She said, ""Today we will start a group project. I\'ll assign groups. Remember to work together."" Generic_Name moaned and expected the worst. His group ended up being consisted of students that didn\'t know how to work together. They ended up arguing over everything ""What happened to \'teamwork\'?"" the teacher asked, startled. Generic_Name answered, ""Well if we had more opportunities to work with other people, we might know more about teamwork."" ""I better talk to the principal for more teamwork opportunities,"" Generic_Name\'s teacher said, shaking her head. I agree with the principal\'s decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make friends, increase self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.\nThe first reason why I support the decision of students participating in extra activities is that students can make friends. If students were able to join a club/activity of their choice, they would meet other people with similar interests, leading to new friends. For example, I have participated in the Generic_School Chamber Orchestra since 6th grade, and I met one of my current best friends at this club. I also have friends I met there that are at high school right now. I got closer to these people because I joined Chamber. All of us were advanced at playing an instrument, resulting in many similarities. Students with similar interests that join the same club usually have a lot of time to spend together, resulting in a friendship because they were able to connect for so long. A whole club could learn how fun it is to be around each other and even form a new friend group. I\'m sure Generic_Name could use a new friend group right now!\nThe second reason why I support the principal\'s decision is that students could develop better self confidence. Some people don\'t try out for a sport because they are too nervous about what other people would think about them. If it was mandatory for these students to join or tryout, they could make it and see how good/talented they actually are. This results in higher confidence. A shy and low-esteemed student being part of a club and making friends could finally see how funny they are, making them happier with higher confidence. For instance, I have a friend that I dance with that had a low self confidence. She started making friends, and now she is very outgoing. Maybe if the shy girls tried out for the cheerleadingÂ team, they would join and become a preppy cheerleader stereotype.\nThe final reason why I agree with the decision of students having to participate in at least one activity is that students would develop teamwork skills. People who play sports or participate in clubs know that teamwork is important. A basketball team that passes the ball to each other is more likely to score than a team with one person doing everything. If students were ""forced"" to join an activity, they would develop teamwork skills that would help them for group projects. It would even help them in the future for when they get a job. There are very few jobs now where teamwork isn\'t important because people need each other to complete a task. For example, it would be hard for a construction worker to build a whole house by himself. If the school made it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would help them with teamwork tremendously (especially Generic_Name).\nBounce, bounce.\nGeneric_Name practically skips into the school because he is so excited for Robotics. Ever since the principal made all students join an extracurricular activity, all students seemed to be happy to come to school. The building welcomed all students to a new school day. ""Hey Generic_Name!"" calls out Generic_Name\'s new friends. Generic_Name met them by joining Robotics. He runs to them and the whole Robotics team dives into conversation. ""I\'m so glad that I have such great friends that have similar interests as me,"" Generic_Name says cheerfully. Everyone laughs as they agree to walk to Robotics together. ""Hey everyone! Can anyone answer this question?"" Generic_Name\'s teacher asks while the students got settled in class. Everyone\'s hands shot up, including Generic_Name\'s. The teacher called on Generic_Name and he stated the right answer. ""Correct!"" the teacher said, and Generic_Name beamed. He was proud of himself and his new self confidence. He figured out how smart and funny he was after joining Robotics. He also figured out that he was great at math, and even led his team to victory at the Robotics Championship. ""Let\'s work on our projects!"" the teacher said. Generic_Name\'s group got together and they worked diligently for the rest of class. They each joined a club or sport, so they figured out teamwork. They worked together to produce an A+ worthy project. The teacher said, ""I\'m so proud that you guys figured out teamwork. The principal made a great decision!"" I agree with the principal\'s decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because they can make friends, gain self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.',

        "Many people have at least one activity that they love, care about, or are passionate about. School helps many kids find out their strengths and weaknesses. I believe that our school should make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. This will benefit students tremendously. If these activities can help students expand their social skills, get new opportunities, and let them have some fun at school, then I think our schools should have this requirement.\nFirst, we are going to talk about one of the reasons why the students should be required to be part of at least one extracurricular activity. That reason is sociability. If someone that is shy joins a club that they are interested in, they might talk more because they are in their element and where they feel the safest. Being in a club can also give kids the opportunity to make new friends. Students can learn social skills from working in groups within the club, or working with the whole club. Students might feel like they fit in more if they are in an activity where mostly everyone has a common interest. Depending on the club, there are multiple different ways that doing an extracurricular activity can help a student expand their social skills.\nNewÂ opportunitiesÂ and getting to explore different interests are a great benefit of doing an extracurricular activity. Students can learn about something they never knew existed. One time I was at a camp and they made us choose an activity that we wanted to try. I chose wood burning, and I had a learned a plethora of things that I did not know before. If the camp had never made me choose something to do, I would have never learned about wood burning. This very closely relates with the extracurricular activities. Students can get exposure to different types of activities, and may even find a new hobby that they enjoy. Next, we will talk about the third reason why I believe that we should make the activity mandatory.\nThe third reason why students should have to do an activity is so they can have fun. For many kids, school is work and stress. If they have a club to look forward to at the end of the day, it can make school more enjoyable, and maybe even more fun. It is also relaxing to have an activity that you get to do with your friends, and not worry about homework or tests. Some extracurricular activities may have fun projects or activities to do that students can enjoy. If a student is doing an activity that they enjoy or have an interest in, then it is likely that they will be having fun.\nHaving fun, learning new social skills, and exploring different clubs/activities are just some of the many reasons why our school should make extracurricular activities mandatory. These activities can lead students through a journey of self-discovery, and can benefit most of the students. I think it is the right choice to make all students do an extracurricular activity, and doing so will let kids enjoy some of the things that they care about and are passionate about.",

How many days do you find yourself at home, wishing you were out playing football, but you didnt have a team, or needing help on your science homework, but your teacher wasn't there to help you? Extracurriculars can fix those problems becuase they offer after school sports, help from teachers, and many other fun activities. While they have many advantages, some students won't participate in fear they might not know anyone there, or because their friends aren't doing them. Schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can get you active, are socially beneficial, and can help you in school.\nThe first reason schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular is because it gets you active. Schools offer sports like basketball, football, and various other activities, and you can even be on a team! Being active is a very important factor in being healthy, and has many health benefits, like lowering risk of heart disease. After schools sports can also help you relax and have fun after a long day at school. School is seven hours long, and most of it is sitting and learning. After school, you can join sports clubs to get out all the energy you've been holding in all day, and have fun after all the stress of school. Sports and being active is also fun! You can do some simple layups, or play a whole game, it's up to you! Extracurricular sports clubs are helpful because they get you active and moving, have health benefits, and are enjoyable.\nAdditionally, after school clubs are socially beneficial. When you join a new club, you may not know everybody there, but you will make new friends. You will meet new, interesting people in after school clubs that you didn't know before. These new people could become some of your closest friends, and be super fun and cool to hang out with! You would already know something about them, which is a shared interest in the club you are both in. Meeting someone with similar interests helps to form friendships, and connections between people. You could also choose to do something with the friends you already have, like all joining a club and playing basketball together afterschool. After school clubs are socially beneficial because they help you meet new people, or hang out with close friends.\nFinally, extracurricular activities can help you out in school. You could stay after for a study group to help you prepare for a big test coming up, or simply to understand the material better. You could also stay after with a teacher for a class you may be struggling with. Other struggling students would be there too so you wouldn't be singled out, and all of you can learn together if you are having similar problems. After school study groups can also give you time to finish your homework, and get help or guidance if you need it. As well as homework, you can work on projects in school that maybe you don't have the materials for outside of school. If you have a big art project in progress, you could stay after in art to work on it, to really give it your all, and make it the best it can be. An extracurricular study group is very helpful to your education, and has many benefits.\nExtracurricular groups should be required because they are very beneficial to a students life. They help to get students active, social, and improve upon a students learing experience. I know that staying after school has helped me a lot. When I was struggling with a new unit in math I stayed after school to get some help from my teacher. After working on it for a little bit I could actually understand what I was learning. I wouldnt have understood it as well if I hadn't stayed for a study group to help me. I also know that i love sports, and staying after school for a sports club sounds like so much fun! Schools should require participation in at least one extracurricular activity because they increase your activity, benefit you socially, and help you in school.Â",

        "Think back to your middle and high school days where the biggest decision you had to make was what club you were going to participate in with your best friend. Was is required to join a club, or did you do it for fun and the experience? The majority of students participate in extracurricular activities to learn or practice certain skills they obtained in that activity. Although, this is not the case for everyone because there is still some students that do not engage in non-academic related activities because it isn't required.Â I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives them the opportunity to discover new activities, participate in something new and learn a set of social skills they will carry with themselves for the rest of their lives.\nThere is a very wide array of extracurricular activities to choose from, therefore you have more opportunities to discover something new. You might join a club or sport because your best friend is doing it or your parents told you to give it a try, and you could realize that the activity is something you really enjoy and are passionate about. Sometimes, people get hesitant to try new things, but what harm could be done? The worst thing that could happen is that you don't enjoy the activity and might have to try something different. Overall, joiningÂ an extracurricular activity is one of the best ways to learn about or discover something you truly enjoy.\nAll of the extracurricular activities you engage in should be things you enjoy doing because they take up a big part of your life and can sometimes act as the support you need to get through tough situations. Sometimes academics can be stressful, but that is where the activities that you enjoy come in. Especially as students get older, they tend to resort to their hobbies as a way to keep them calm. Extracurricular activities can also effect your academic performance and the other way around. This is shown a lot through sports because, most of the time, your grades affect whether you get to play or not. Additionally, participating in activities allows you to practice and show off your skills. Therefore participating in an activity can be beneficial to your life in multiple ways.\nHaving a set of social skills is crucial to your adult life, and one of the best ways to understand this is by doing an activity that helps you form those skills. Discipline, for example, is one of the main skills you learn, especially when participating in sports. There is other skills you learn as well that are applied more to your social life. Being around people that are passionate about the same activities you love creates friendships that can last you the rest of your life. Many people meet their greatest friends through participating in activities both of them enjoy. By joining a club or activity, you influence not only others, but yourself to work harder and accomplish your goals. For example, if you were on the soccer team, you might want to make it a goal to work out every day after school to make your stronger. Engaging in extracurricular activities creates additional skill sets that help your social life as a human.\nIn conclusion, participating in at least one extracurricular activity should be required for students because it not only allows them to explore new activities, but it benefits their academic and social skills. Although there can be conflicts with money and time that some students might not have, it is still important to give them the experiences they need to become vulnerable to success.Â",

I agree with the principals decision toÂ make all students participate in a extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities, not only help with really important life skills, they provide an opportunity to make new friends and it helps students with their collage and job applications.\nExtracurricular activities help people learn important life skills and lessons. Their are some skills that can only be obtained by practicing and joining extracurricular activities. Skills like, public speaking, typing, writing and being organized are skills that people pick up from a lotÂ of practice and extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities dose not only teach skills it teachesÂ lessons. leaning lessons at an age where it is possible to understand what is being taught, helps those lessons be at the top of their head where it will never be forgotten. All the lessons and skills the people learn stick with them throughout their life time. When I was enrolled into an extracurricular activity by my parents, I learned the skill of how to keep thing neat an organized, and that skill has kept with meÂ ever since. That skill of being neat and organized helps me with finding work for my next class and keeping my locker very usable. Because of the skills and lessons I have learned from extracurricular activities, I agree with the principals decision.\nExtracurricular activities also provide an opportunity to make new friends and strengthen existing friendships.\nThe first time someone attends an extracurricular activity, they are usually bombarded with friendly faces everywhere they look. All of the people that show up to the class are bound to have a social interaction with someone they see. Their are certain extracurricular activities were everyone needs to talk with their peers. Activities like debate and soccer are examples were everyone needs to communicate to each other to ensure that they know what to do and what is happening. Extracurricular activities force people to spend time with each other. When I was enrolled for an extracurricular activity, all we did was work with each other on activities and working with other people enhanced my existing friendships and helped build new friendships. Extracurricular activities have impacted me in a way where without them I would not have meet some of my really good friends, and that is why I think all students should take at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\nExtracurricular activities help with collage and job applications. Extracurricular activities show people the amount of experience someone has. When someone is reviewing an application for a doctoring job for example, they look at how much experience the person has had in the field or on call. The extracurricular activity someone is in, not only helps with showing their experience, it gives that person a taste of what their applying too and it can boost their confidence. Those activities you participate in can also, instead of boosting their confidence, tell them that they might not actually like that activity and pursue a different one. I had always been interested in coding and couple of weeks after I had began I realized that coding was not for me and that I really enjoyed playing sports.\nThe extracurricular activities not only show your experience they also how your determination toward something.\nWhen someone signs up for extracurricular activity they are also sighing up for a course where they have to take out their own time and money for it which overall shows determination towards that activity. The amount of help the extracurricular activities give people is tremendousÂ compared to just learning by yourself and that is my thought process on why every student should be enrolled in to any sort of extracurricular activities.\nThe principal made a really good decision to make all of the students participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity.\nExtracurricular activities help people obtain certain skills and lessons that can only be provided from extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities also provides a platform to make new friend and enhance existing friendships.

        "Have you ever been forced to participate in something that you never wanted to have a part in? Well, this same situation will become a reality for many students at my school very soon. You see, Mrs. Generic_Name, the principal of my school, has decided that each student must participate in an extracurricular activity. This means that a student has to do an activity regardless if they want to or not. If students are required to do this, then they will not be able to complete their mandatoryÂ after schoolÂ obligations, spend precious time with their family, and they will have more stress added to their life.\nFirst off, since most extracurricular activities take place after school, students will not be able to complete their obligations waiting for them at home. For example, many students will no longer be able to watch their younger siblings until their parents return home from work. As a result, parents will need to find someone to watch their younger children. There are also quite a few students who have the responsibility of taking care of their family pets once they are finished with the school day. A few of the tasks that come with this responsibility are feeding the animals, taking them to the bathroom, and exercising them. Along with taking care of their younger siblings and their pets, students also need to complete their chores. So as you can see, it is extremely important that students are able to go straight home after school, instead of staying after for an extra hour or two, so they can fulfill these obligations.\nSecondly, participating in an extracurricular activity will pry into the limited and precious time that students are able to spend with their family. For example, most adolescents get home from school around four o'clock in the afternoon, and many of their parents get home around five in the afternoon. A majority of families eat dinner between five and six at night. Once you clean the kitchen up from dinner, that only leaves about four hours to spend with your family. Depending on when the students' activity takes place, that suspends the amount of time a family spends together to around three hours. That is hardly enough time to do anything together! A famous family counselor once said, \"\"Your child is a newborn for a month, an infant for a year, a toddler for two, an elementary schoolerÂ for six years, a preteen for three, and a teenager for five. Time is precious, so don't waste it.\"\" Children are at school more than they are at home. The more time that is added for school, the less time that is given for family.\nLastly, when students take on an extracurricular activity, they will have more stress added to their life. For example, if Generic_Name decided to write for the sports section of our school paper, he would need to go to every basketball, football, and baseball game. Then, he would need to write a detailed report about each of the games that he goes to. Since basketball games are every Monday, the football games are on Friday nights, and baseball games are on Saturdays and Sundays, Generic_Name would be writing at least four reports a week. That doesn't even include if any of the teams make it to the State Championships. If another student decided to join Drama, then he/she would need to attend at least seven weekday and two weekend practices a month, four dress rehearsals, and all five performances. Plus, the student would need to stay after each performance to help clean the set and put it back into order for the next night. Along with all this extra work of being in an extracurricular activity, students also have to complete their never ending work load from school. With all of this combined, there is enough stress to give these students severe health problems.\nIn conclusion, being required to take part in an extracurricular activity will result in students not being able to complete important after school obligations, losing precious time to spend with family, and having extra stress added to their life. Having the activities are a great idea, but the problem is that Mrs. Generic_Name is requiring them. If she allowed the activities to be optional, then families wouldn't have to find someone to watch their younger children, those who chose not to participate would be able to spend more time with their families, and there would be a lot less stress for the students to handle.Â From what you have read, I hope that you will agree with me and take a stance on my side against Mrs. Generic_Name's decision for participating in a mandatory, extracurricular activity.Â",

        "Imagine having to go home from school to have to do your homework, and then picking up your sibling from elementary school, then making dinner for them all while your both your parents are working.\nYou go to bed at 11 every night to wake up at 6 to go to school.\nNow your principal is requiring one extracurricular activity for each student. How are you going to fit that into your already busy schedule?\nI don't think that the principal should require students to participate in one extracurricular activity.\nI think this because some students do not have the time to add another activity into the day, school should not control your personal life, and although some students might be doing the bare minimum, that doesn't mean other students aren't trying hard in school.\nTo start off, students should not be required to have one extracurricular activity because some students do not have the time to add another extracurricular activity into their day.\nAlthough some activities might be in school, they add on more work and stress to the student.\nSome students struggle to complete homework by their bedtime everyday.\nSome students do not even finish their homework until around one in the morning.\nThose students also have to wake up around 6 to go back to school.\nThat comes out to about 6 hours of sleep when they should be getting 8 or 9 hours of sleep.\nThe situation for every student is different.\nFor example, a student might have to take care of a younger sibling and tend to the house while both the parents work. Do you think that this is fair?\nReason number two for the principal not requiring a extracurricular activity for each student.\nSchool should not be able to control your personal life along with your school life.\nThere is a border between your personal and school life.\nTime is a precious thing.\nIf one extracurricular activity equals around 1-2 hours, then that will mean you will finish you homework two hours later, and that means you will have less free time to hang out and relax.\nSo, instead of going to that movie or dinner with your friends, you have to do homework and study.\nSchool already takes up 6+ hours of your day, how much longer can they make it?\nMy final reason that students should not have to add an extracurricular activity to their day is that some students are already working hard for their age and some students are not privileged like other students.\nTheir families might be struggling to make ends meet every day and they might have to work a job just so their siblings can eat dinner.\nThey are already hardworking and shouldn't have to work more just because the principal wants to require this.\nAdding this activity will just add more stress to the student.\nThe school is not aware of everyone's situation. I do not think that these hardworking students deserve this.\nIn conclusion, the principal should not require an extracurricular activity because some students are too busy to add another activity into the day, your personal life is separate from your school life, and the principal should not be able to add more work on to the stressed, hardworking students.\nDoing something like this would not be fair.",

        "Humans are like penguins. Just as penguins huddle together in the midst of a storm, humans huddle together in groups and find comfort and healing when they're with people that have the same interests. If that's the case, joining extra-curricular activities is a good opportunity to not only build life-long friendships, but also learn about different clubs and hobbies everyone can dive into.\nFor starters, being on a team automatically builds friendships and an unbreakable bond. A team is a group of the most valuable people in your life because members encourage one another and lift one another up. In many professional games, team members root for each other and help each other to be successful. When you see members respecting one another, there's no doubt about the friendship and love between the members. Also, people with the same hobbies become close very quick because of the same passion. I have met many of my close friends through the love of sports. Since my team had the same love of softball as I did, I felt as if I had known them for many years and something just clicked. Lastly, teams stick together. Through thick and thin, players stick together. Many professional players have been with each other for a long time. Since they've been together, they know each players strengths and weaknesses and how to help them. Gradually, a friendship forms and a life-long partner is born. All in all, being apart of a group not only forms a deeper love for the sport, but friendships beyond compare.\nSecond, anyone and everyone can be apart of a group. This is the perfect opportunity to try new things and learn about new hobbies. For example, many people didn't even know a club about learning sign language existed, but after trying it out, they became in love with the art of sign language and ended up becoming translators in the future. Also, you never know where this small hobby can lead to in life. For instance, one of my favorite hobbies is playing chess. When I was first forced to attend the club, I didn't know anything whatsoever about chess. However, I soon realized I loved playing chess and it was a good opportunity I seized. Lastly, everyone deserves a safe community full of people with the same passion. Research shows that those with a group to be in have a stable mentality and more self-confidence. Therefore, joining a simple community can even boost self-confidence and open doors to unknown hobbies.\nIn conclusion, being apart of a team or club benefits many aspects of life such as an incredible bond and friendship with team members, and a safe environment with other people that share the same interests. Something as simple as joining a club may change the way you perceive life. Just like penguins, everyone deserves a place to be.Â",

        "Having an extra curricular activity is a good way to find out what you like or dont like, or what you would to do later in life. It can be both a good and a bad thing. Having an extracurricular activity will help you make new friends, feel good about your self or just in general, and you can also be yourself.\nWhile doing an activity you will be able to make new friends. At the activity you will meet new people that you probably have never met before. By meeting new people you are gaining new friendships and gaining new people that you can count on, and trust. You can also meet people that have the same interest as you. Therefore you will be able to do stuff together and will end up going the the same activity, and will be able to do things together because you both like the same things. You will also be bale to understand each othersÂ point of view. When people are asking you question about your activity you can both see where each otherÂ are coming from and can give them tips and tricks that they can use in the activity, and you can agree on the pros, and cons, the easy, and not so easy parts. While in the activity you can meet new people, make new friends, and who know you could both be friends forever.\nBy looking for an activity you can find that one thing that you love to do earlier and younger in your life. You can find things that your good at may that be sports, acting, singing, photography, and so much more. Also you can keep searching until you find something that you want to put your heart into. By searching you may find new things that you never thought that you would like. Maybe you thought that you would LOVE basketball but then end up loving pottery. Or maybe you thought that you would LOVE acting but instead you like singing. There are so manyÂ things that you could end up trying and loving them. You could also find thing that will make you feel good, may that be about your self or in general. You may play a sport and start to notice that you are happier and not in as bad of a mood all the time. They say that by working out and doing a sport boosts your endorphin'sÂ making you happier. Or even doing something that you love will put you in a better mood because you cant wait to do it or go back to it again, and therefore will have something to look forward to everyday. Therefor you can find things that you love and continue to do it and grow and be better.\nHowever having an extra curricular activity can mean more harm than good. When you have an activity you may not have enough time for house hold duties or even your homework for school. Your activity may run later and you may get home late. The you will have to eat something if you didnt already before, and get ready for bed. But by that time you may not have enough time for your school work or the things that you need to do at home. But if you learn how to time manage everything that needs to be done then you should be okay. By challenging your self you are growing better as a person, and will be able to do things that may be harder for other people to do.\nIn conclusion it is a good idea to do an extra curricular activity as it will help you meet more people, be more comfortable with your self. Will help you get out of your comfort zone and get out there and live. Also find things that you are good at and love. And by doing something you love you are learning little by little to love your self. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "If you were a school principal, would you want your students to participate in extracurricular activities? As a result of their numerous advantages, many schools encourage their students to participate in them. My principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activityÂ can be beneficial, as it gives them a chance to make more friends, be more productive, and find possible career options or passions.\nOffering students the opportunity to participate in extra curricular activities gives them a chance to get to know more people, and make new friends.Â When socializing during these activities, they can get to know people that they would not meet without this opportunity. They can also share their passions or hobbies with other people who might have the same interests, causing them to become friends.Â The third reason is that they might see friends that they do not often see during the school day. These activities cause students to engage in different conversations, and be more social around other people.\nParticipating in extracurricular activities might result in students performing tasks that are more productive compared to what they usually do at home.Â At home, students might be bored and might not have any tasks or activities to complete after doing their homework.Â As an effect of not having anything to do, they might waste their time playing video games or going on social media. Similarly, this would be a waste of learning time where they could be more productive, and could find new ideas or projects to do. These activities can help students see that there are interesting tasks that they can explore, which are more useful than using social media, phones, or other distractions.\nEncouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them find possible career options, and discover new interests or passions. As they perform different tasks provided by these activities, they can find new interests that they did not know they had. Different chances offered can help students develop a passion that they already have, as they might not have necessary tools for it at home. Additionally, adults organizing these tasks can introduce career options in the field of the activity to students who are interested in them. Extracurricular activities can assist students in finding which pathway they will choose for their careers.\nAs a conclusion, all these factors are beneficial for the students, which show that these activities provided by the school can help them with their social life, as well as academics and other work. It encourages them to dedicate their time and effort. As proved by these reasons, the decision made by the school principal concerning extra curricular activities can be beneficial and extremely rewarding for students, by providing them with an opportunity to make new friends and get to know more people, perform productive tasks, and discover what possible career options and jobs there are in different fields.Â",

It is an invasion of freedom, In a way, to make students pick to either play a sport, work on a yearbook, or serve on the student council without their will and some type of benefit. It could also effect their parents/guardian, if students are made to play a sport, because the parents/guardian would most likely have to drop them off and pick them up from games or practices. It should depend on what the students want to do and what they can do, no one should ever be forced to do something if they don't want to do it.\nI think they should allow students to do an activity and give them the choice to decide if they want to do it or not.

I disagree, schools shouldnt make students do that because the activities are something extra for the students who want it. Another reason is if you force someone to go out of their comfort zone, theyre less productive. Lastly, if it was a requirement the schools would need more activities such as clubs and sports teams. In conclusion, schools should not turn these activities into a requirement.\nFirst, schools shouldnt because it is meant for people who want something extra. People who do these activities usually require good grades. Others may be looking at something new. Then they're are ones who just like to do things so they do whatever interests them. This is why these activities are supposed to be something extra.\nAnother reason is if you force students or anyone to do something it usually means they're less productive. If someone joined a play for the school by force its most likely they will be removed because of either not helping or they're not working.\nLastly, if it was a requirement schools would have to make more clubs or sports teams. Schools can have a lot of students mine holds about 1,000 and they're are sport teams or clubs that are too large. FFA and FCCLA are competing clubs but if the schools make it a requirement people will choose them thinking theyll not do anything and ruin it for the ones who enjoy the club. Another good one would be if the school puts on a play certain people may ruin it by moving or breaking props or other impotantÂ items.\nIn conclusion, schools shoud not turn these activities into a requirement.

Just try it, you never know, you might enjoy it."" Generic_Name said, trying to motivate Generic_Name. Confidently, Generic_Name responded with, ""Okay, I\'ll try it."" All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.\nTo start with, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps them make new friends. This is important because it can help a student who struggles socially. For example, say that you don\'t make friends very well. Joining a sport or a club will help you find someone who shares the same interests as you. Another reason is that it will help students become close with students that aren\'tÂ in their grade. For instance, almost all school activities are open to all grades. This is the only time students will be able to socialize with the grades above or below them. So it\'s important that they take advantage of it. Lastly, it\'s important that students make new friends because it can help them become more involved in school activities. To emphasize, I ran track my eighth grade year. My friends motivated me to tryout. I ended up loving it and making so many new friends with sixth and seventh graders.\nSecondly, requiring students to join a school activity will keep them busy. To start of with, when students are done with their homework they immediately go on their phone. To fix this problem, keeping students busy with a sport or a club will prevent them from being on their phone to much. Moreover, so many kids complain of being bored and not having anything to do after school. This is because they\'re not busy. To support my opinion, during track season I never complained of not having anything to do. I was always occupied either with homework or I was at practice. The last reason why it\'s important to keep students busy is because it gives them the opportunity to practice their time management skills. To illustrate, at the beginning of track season I was very stressed about how I was going to complete all my homework. By the end of the season I knew how to manage all my time and didn\'t have to stress on how I was going to finish my homework.\nFinally, requiring students to participate in a club or sport gets students get out of their comfort zone. Getting students\' out of their comfort zone is important because it prepares them for the work force. To elaborate, in the work force you don\'t get a choice whether or not you do something. You have to do it, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Another reason is that putting yourself out of your comfort zone can make you grow into a more confident person. For instance, I joined MAC committee when I was in eighth grade. Talking in frontÂ of a whole class made me uncomfortable. Now that I look back at it, it was worth it. I\'m so much more confident as a person.\nAnother reason is that getting out of your comfort zone can change your point of view. To illustrate, my friend\'s parents forced him to join the art club. At first he thought it was weird and only for the ""geeks"". Joining the art club changed his whole point of view. He now loves art and wants to pursue it as a career.\n""This is so fun!"" Generic_Name exclaimed, as she kicked the soccer ball. ""I told you, all you had to do was get out of your comfort zone."" Generic_Name responded. ""Yeah, you were right. I\'m so happy that you encouraged me to do this. I\'ve made so many new friends and found out I really enjoy playing soccer."" Generic_Name agreed, ""Me too. Soccer keeps me busy and off my phone."" In conclusion, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps students make new friends, it keeps students busy, and gets students get out of their comfort zone.',

When you are playing sports you are moving and this in an extracurricular activity. When you move and workout it helps you to burn fat which will make you healthier and more fit. As well as when you do activities that make you move you will have more fun and have a great time. There was this one time where I was really bored and had nothing to do in Elementary school so my friends told me to sign up for this running club where they do activities and really practice running. It really helped me have fun and, it also helped me get fit. So if your a sporty kid or not you should participate in sporting activities because you will have a lot of fun and will get really fit.\nWorking on things for your school is a great extracurricular activity. When you work for the school maybe under a project it makes you think outside of the box. When you think outside of the box your getting out of a small mindset and doing projects and working hard is a great way to practice getting out of the small mind set and really think big. When you work on school projects you must also work efficient so it is a great way to practice how to work efficient. In Elementary school I worked on the school yearbook. It was a lot of fun and I really had to work hard and smart so I could make the yearbook look really good .So if you can learn how to work efficient and use big ideas you can really do anything.\nWhen you do extracurricular activities you are able to make new friends. This is a great way to just join in with everyone and have a lot of fun and meet new people. When you do activities in sports you can meet new people who also love sports or who have other of the same interest as you. When you maybe do and extracurricular activity for an art club you can meet other people that love art and then maybe you guys can become friends. I once did a basketball club in Elementary school. Even though I was not that good I still met friends who were just like me just there to learn. That is why extracurricular activities are great ways to meet new friends.\nI chose to agree that that every student should do one extracurricular activity instead of disagree. I think that you should do extracurricular activities they will really help you in every way possible. I agree that every student should have to do one extracurricular activity because, doing actives outside and having to move a lot will keep you fit and healthy, when you work hard on things to maybe help your school it will make you think outside of the box, and extracurricular activities will help you meet new people and make new friends.",

        "Agree or disagree? I think joining in a extracurricular activity is very beneficial, because students are able to be a little more active and help the community. Extracurricular activities has so many outcomes to participating in these activities. Students may not have the opportunity to do there pleasures that may they do at home or once they get out of school. This can also interfere with a students social and sport life. Although there are down sides to extracurricular activities there is a huge benefit such as, knowing that a student has helped or even cared about what he was doing weather it was planting plants, trees, flowers, playing a sport, or even helping a student with their homework. I strongly stand by the that participating in an extracurricular is beneficial, not only is it beneficial it is also enjoyable.\nSome activities that students are able to participate in are sports, yearbook committee, student council, and helping out with the environment. Another way this is beneficial is because weather you like it or not it really helps out the person, the community, and even the ourselves. While doing these activities you continue to make someones day by helping out just even a little bit. Many people, including myself enjoy watering the plants, a little goes a long way. Students often enjoy getting to know others and this is a great way to do so. How cool is it to know we have done an extracurricular activity and while helping our community? There are many activities that students are able to learn and put their brain to the test in a extracurricular session, for example student council. Student council is one of the many mind and brain focusing activities there are in these activities.\nExtracurricular activities can be enjoyable and entertaining. I used to stay after for yearbook committee, and we all learned some new and interesting things. While I was in that that club I was given the opportunity to learn a little more about how I can work on the computer and cropping/fixing images. This activity was very helpful and fun. I now know how it all works out and how I can get involved. If it hadÂ not been for my teacher who told me to get involved I wouldn't be as involved as I am right now. I know enjoy doing extracurricular activities. Lastly, Helping out is not such a horrible thing.\nParticipating in activities at a local school doesn't have to be terrible. There are so many activities out there that everyone can try and enjoy. Students get so many interesting things they ca do. Should students participate, yes they should. Many students want to just go home and not do anything, this helps them come out of their shell a lot more. School is not always boring, have fun at school. What will your next extracurricular class be, what will you do to get involved?Â",

        "I agree with the principals decision of every student having an extracurricular activity. Many students might disagree with this decision, because of some students not wanting to have an after school activity. However as being a student myself I have chosen to agree with this decision. When students have an after school activity, the activities that they choose to do can impact them in many ways. There are many reasonsÂ on why I believe that a student should participate in at least one after school activity. However, here are three reasons why I hold the opinion of students being required to have an after school activity.\nStudents will become more involved throughout their school community. If a student joins a school sport club they might be able to make some new friends. When students are able to make more friends they will not feel bored in a class if they have a new friend that happens to be in that same class. Students will also be able to know what is happening in other parts of the school, because of making new friends. When students are more involved in their schools community, they won't be confused of what is going on within their surroundings.\nWhen students have an after school activity, they might figure out what career they would want to have in the future. For example, if a student chose to serve on the student council. This extracurricular activity can help students to decide whether or not they would in the future run for a government position. If a school has Home EC as an extracurricular then a student might choose to become a baker in the future. Depending on the what your school offers, any activity you decide to join will help you when it comes time for choosing an occupation.\nIn the future students will be able to reflect on the things that they have done in the past. When a student becomes older their kids may ask what they did when they were younger. Which is a reason why students should work on their schools yearbook, because they will be able to show their future children what they did in school. These students will be able to show their children the yearbook that his or her classmates made together. Therefore, being another reason why students should participate in activities because of being able to reflect on the past.\nAs you may now know the many reasons on why I believe that students should have an after school club. Like I said before when a student chooses a certain activity, this activity may hold an impact on their life. Requiring students to have an extracurricular activity encourages students to be more involved. I believe that the principal has made the right decision by enforcing students throughout the school to join a club. In conclusion, I think that requiring students to have an activity will benefitÂ many students.",

It should be a choice whether or not you want to have a extracurricular activity or not. I say it should be a choice because alot of people dont like to be active and dont try. If a principal trys to force extracurricular activities on his\\her students than most students wont like nor participate in most of the activitys the classes will be doing once they are in the class.\nIf i where to agree with this decision than i would say that it would be a great idea for the people who do like to play sports, help with yearbook, and be on the student council. I would also say it would be a great opportunity for the students who dont like these activities because it would give them a chance to be active and to give them a chance to have an activity involving the student council or yearbook.\nBut im not, i fully disagree with this decision due to its idea of making students participate in activitys that they may or may not want to participate in.Â",

        "Extracurriculars are activities that generally take place after school hours. These activities can range from clubs like Jazz Band or Latin Club to sports like Soccer or Basketball. Students stay after school to attend activities such as these for fun. Making these activities mandatory could create health problems in some students, take valuable time away from students, and ruin the fun of extracurriculars.\nFor some students, just being in a school building can give them anxiety. Making them stay after school to participate in extracurriculars would worsen this anxiety. Some extracurriculars even require extra work outside of school, adding more stress to the stress students already edure everyday at school. Requiring students to participate in extracurriculars would affect the attitudes of some students, since they are being worked harder than usual.\nSome students' parents can't get off work early to come pick their child up after extracurriculars. Some students have siblings that need to be taken care of after school everyday. Extracurriculars take time away from student to finish their homework. For some students, it can take several hours to complete a single homework assignment. Students would have to stay up later to do their homework making them tired at school the next day.\nMandatory extracurriculars would create overcrowding in clubs, given that more students would be attending them. Some clubs have limits on the amount of students allowed in the club. More teachers would have to stay after school to accommodate the amount of students in extracurriculars. This change would take time away from teachers who have to grade our school work after school, causing them to have to work in their usual free time.\nOverall, this decision would change the entire idea of extracurriculars, making them seem like actual classes instead of the fun activities they are supposed to be. I believe that making extracurriculars mandatory for all students is a bad idea. I think participating in after school activities should be left to the choice of students and not teachers, and I hope this essay has made you feel the same way.Â",

        'Imagine your principal just annouced that all students must have an activity. He/she said the activity that it can be anything you want. The examples provided are such as, sports, extra studying, tutoring, and clubs. If there was a vote on having an extracurricular activity, I would vote ""yes"". There are many good and important reasons to have an activity, here is why.\nMy first good reason is that having an activity can be really fun. At the end of the school day, you would have something to look foward to. You can make new friends and spend some time with them. You can maybe discover a new hobby you are good at. You can do the stuff that makes you happy.\nMy next good reason for a having an activity, is that it would be helpful in school. If you are having trouble not understanding a subject or concept or your grades are low, this can solve that problem. By having private help from another person, this can make you understand a subject better. Also, it gives you a chance to bring your grade up. It can make you be a better learner or make you be ready and prepared for a test.\nMy final reason for having an activity is extra playing time for sports. School is sometimes fun, but if you like sports, than this is a good way to do the thing you really love. If you are just starting or just learning how to play, than this can be a big help. You would have the ability to know what to do in a practice drill or in a real game. This can make you be even better about baseball, basketball, or soccer etc.\nIn conclusion, having an extracurricular activity is a great idea. You can find the thing you are really good at. It is also a good time to socialize with other people. This is also one of the ways to get extra help in school. You can enjoy any of the things you love to do during this time of the day.Â',

I also think that kids should participate in after school programs because it opens up their young mind to different things like photography some people may not like photography till they try it out andÂ if they try it and like it they like it they stay but if they are not interested they can try some thing else.\nPersonally I like my schools after school program because next year I'll Be a freshman in high schoolÂ and I want to play football and my school has a program that you go to to lift weight. But they don't let join then lift you have to go through some kind of training where you have to do four week of training to touch a weight because they want you to be safe they don't want you to get hurt and not play football next year. Something that is SpecialÂ about this club it's run by the high schoolÂ coaches who are also gym teacher here at my school. My school also has a basketball team we play a school in Generic_City named Generic_School. My school Generic_School And Generic_School have a little rivalry. But My schools basketball team has tryout so they can get the best kids that my schools has so we can beat Generic_School. Really I think my school made a basketball team to let the kids have fun.\nI also think other schools need after school programs because some schools are placed in a bad area and the might live in bad areas with guns, gangs, and violence, but if they make an after school program and encourage kids to go you'll be pulling them from all the violence or joining a gang and doing drugs. Some kids have had to move schools and house just so their child does not become a gang member. I know some people who have ha to move because they lived in a bad neighborhood and their mom and dad pulled them out of school to come to a better school. I thin the principalÂ is just helping the kids enjoy school more and is also helping them stay out of trouble.\nIn conclusion, I think the principle is right because I think the principle is just trying to make school fun for kids and help the kids stay active. Therefore i agree with the principals decision to make an after school program.",

Generic_Name shrugged his shoulders and slouched to his room."" Oh Generic_Name I dont want Generic_Name to be excluded this year just likeÂ last year!"" Generic_Name\'s mother cried."" We\'ve got to give him time, he might feel pressured if we talk to him about it too soon."" Generic_Name\'s dad calmly said. Generic_Name\'s parents waited for him to make new friends or to join a club, but every single afternoon he walks into his room, then eats dinner and he doesn\'t say a word. That next Thursday Generic_Name came home and slouched into his room like always."" I\'m tired of this,"" Generic_Name\'sÂ mom said under her breath. She walked into Generic_Name\'sÂ room and screamed,"" Generic_Name I am tired of this, you can\'t hide away just because you are deaf. Your hearing aids are supposed to allow you to hear and talk to people, but you don\'t. You don\'t even talk to me."" Generic_Name\'sÂ dad walked in."" Generic_Name tell your son that he needs to make friends or at least join a club!"" Generic_Name looked at his mom in shock. Students should join a club because, it can help relieve stress from school, clubs can help you meet new people, and it can give you a hobby to do at home.\nFirst, students get stressed easily when a big test is coming up, or if they have a lot of homework and can\'t do it all. Stress can make you feel unhappy which can build up anxiety. When I was in sixth grade I was not in any clubs, and during tests I would panic and forget the answers. I decided to go to the councilor for help and the councilor gave me some good tips on how to keep calm during a test. Having a club to go to can give you something to look forward to during the school day and make you feel less anxious about school work. When I was in seventh grade I joined the yearbook and FAC\'S clubs. I didn\'t feel stressed during a test and my school work seemed easier than the year before.\nAlso, clubs are a great way to meet new people and make new friends. Somebody could like the same thing as you and you never knew. When I was a seventh grader I joined the yearbook club and on the first day\nGeneric_Name told us to get into groups of two or more and go to take photo\'s of the other clubs around, but I didn\'t know anyone. I was walking down the hallway with a boy, and to my surprise he put his hand out and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in eighth grade."" I took his hand and said,"" My name is Generic_Name, I am in seventh grade."" Clubs can help you make that first step to say hello. In eighth grade I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club, I started talking to people that I had never talked to before. I found that these people that I have never talked to have something in common with me. I started to talk to these people I met around the school too.\nThird, sometimes when you join a club that club becomes a hobby and you start to do it at home. In my seventh grade year I joined the FAC\'S club. In the FAC\'S club we would bake and cook food, then I started to bake cookies and brownies more often at home and I also got my brother into it too. Know even though I am not in the FAC\'S club I still love to bake. Clubs can give you an opportunity to try something new, and most of the time if it is something that you like you start to do it at home. In my eighth grade year I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club. I shared it with my brother, and know we invite his friends to come play a campaign with us almost every weekend.\nGeneric_Name stood up and walked toward his mom, then opened his arms up to give his mom a hug. "" I am sorry mom,"" he said,"" I will try to make friends."" The next day Generic_Name came home and strolled down the hallway to his room. He came back out and walked over to his mom."" Hey mom,"" Generic_Name said. "" What is it Generic_Name do you need help with your homework?"" "" Well actually mom, I took a flier from the tennis club, I was wondering if you would sign it?"" Generic_Name smirked. His moms face lite up and jumped in the air. She grabbed a pen and neatly signed the formÂ like she was about to win the lottery. A few weeks later Generic_Name\'s mom was sitting on the bleachers cheering for Generic_Name who is working hard on the court. Generic_Name took the last hit and swung his racket as hard as he could. The ball hit the ground and the crowd on the bleachers jumped in the air. "" Nice one Generic_Name, you learn so fast!"" Generic_Name\'s friend exclaimed. "" Thanks.""

        "I definitely agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For one, it would help raise their GPA, especially if it is low at the moment. Most of the time there is an extracurricular activity for everyone, like STEM, Home EC, Yearbook club, Shop, and so on. Extracurricular activities provide a fun alternative than just going home at the end of the school day. Students can stay after school, come before school, or even go during their lunch period to their extracurricular activity.\nHowever, an injury or disability, like a broken leg or perhaps a learning disability could prevent a student from doing an activity that they want to do. Most of the time there are other activities that the student could do if they can't do the one they want. Sometimes, that particular activity could be canceled, maybe due to the weather if it is an outside activity, like a sports club, or maybe the supervisor isn't there that day. Maybe the student cannot go on a particular day because they already have something scheduled after school.\nSome people might not agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. They might say that the student may not have time for it, or there is no activity that they like. If there is no activity that a student wants to do, they can just start a club for it. If they don't have time for that particular activity after school, they can just integrate it into their daily schedule. For instance, if they can't do it on a Monday, they can do it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. They can also serve on the student counsel and perhaps get a particular activity listed as something other students can take. For example, if a school doesn't have a\nHome EC class, the student counsel can possibly try and get that into the course list.\nTaking an extracurricular activity is a good idea for anyone who: has a free schedule; wants to increase their GPA; or wants something fun to do. There is almost always an extracurricular activity for everyone. In conclusion, it is definitely a good idea to take an extracurricular activity whenever possible.",

        "In this day and age of society, most students that attend middle or high schoolÂ revolve around electronics. This is something that I think should change because some students prioritize using electronics over socializing with other classmates or friends. I agree with my principal, and I think that a student must participate in one or more extracurricular activity.\nParticipating in one or more after school activity in my opinion is a great way to socialize with new people, and make some new friends. Playing sports for example builds you as a team player, and helps you have a stronger connection with your team mates. I am currently training for freshman football at Generic_School for next year. Some of my friends and I go to Generic_School and work out in the weight room together, giving us a feeling of support from one another. During training, we are listening to music while we help each otherÂ out with the workouts we are supposed to do. While at workouts, we also get to know some of the JV and Varsity players who attend Generic_School currently. Doing football was a great Idea because of the strong bond I now have with my friends and the current high school players. When we have away games, we all take the bus to go to the other schools, and on the bus, we all talk and prepare our selves for those games. If you don't participate in a sport, general activities are great to socialize in too. Last year, I chose an activity which was out of my comfort zone, tennis. In tennis, I was in a group of about 7 or 8 other kids who I didn't know at all. But when I get showing up to the practices, and I kept making an effort to befriend the other kids, it ended up working out for the better. I got to make new friends and become good at the sport.\nParticipating in an extracurricular activity is also a great way to have fun. Even if the activity you want to participate in isn't a sport, you can always have some fun in an activity that interests you. Having fun for just an hour or so usually brings anyone'sÂ day up to a better mood. I participated in the yearbook committee in 6th grade at Generic_School and it was a great experience. I would have so much fun hanging out with all my friends while we were designing the yearbook and taking pictures for it. Now, even though the yearbook committee wasn't my first choice for my extracurricular activity, it was still really fun in the long run. I also played recreational league soccer in 5th and 6th grade. At the start of every season, our teams would switch players meaning I would have new teammates every time. This was a great way to have fun with different people and cooperate with them as a group. After every one of those activities, I would leave with a smile on my face, and just being there for that one hour made my whole day better.\nExtracurricular activities can also teach you a lot of new things. Yes, doing an extracurricular activity is fun and all, but you end up learning a lot. In the yearbook committee, I learned how to upload pictures onto a document, how to format the pages to have rows of pictures, and to decorate the pages with cool designs. In football, I learn the different types of positions to play, the different playing styles of other players, the different positions to play, and I also learn how to train properly to play the best I can possibly play. In soccer, I also learned different techniques on how to be the best player I can be. Some activities teach you more than let you have fun, but if you like the subject it is on, than it, again, is a great thing to do. I think learning while you are also having fun is one of the best things in life because it is always good to learn, but it also depends on how you are being taught.\nIn conclusion, doing an extracurricular activity benefits you more than anyone else. They teach you good things, you have fun while participating, and you get to socialize with your friends and potentially make new ones. This is why I agree with the principal, and I think we should do at least one. Â",

        "Do you ever wonder what it would be like, if your principal forced you to participate in an extracurricular activity?Â There would be much debate over whether it's a good idea, or a bad idea. Some students would agree with the principal. Some students would disagree with the principal. It's the same way with the parents. Here are three good aspects of having to participate, and my opinion. I agree because students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find a new hobby.\nMy first reason as to why I agree, is because students can get more exercise. Students get a good amount of exercise in gym. However, some students don't get any other exercise. Plus, it is always good to get more exercise. Students need to maintain a healthy body, because a healthy body is a healthy mind. Getting exercise releavesÂ stress for some students. some are lazy couch potatoes, and need to get off their butts.\nMy second reason as to why I agree, is so students can make new friends. Some students don't have a lot of friends. A student without friends is like a puppy left out in the rain. However, forcing them to participate in an extracurricular activity can change that. Some students like making friends, but don't know how to make friends. Some students have a lot of friends, but want more. If there is a new kid, it would give them the chance to make some friends and meet new people. Therefore, doing this can change a students life.\nMy third reason is so students can find a new hobby. On the one hand, some students have plenty of hobbies. On the other hand, some students don't have any hobbies. However, most students have one to five hobbies, which is a fair amount. For the ones that don't think they have enough hobbies, this a great way to help. Also, this could help some students figure out what they want their profession to be.\nIn conclusion, I agree that principals should force students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students can get more exercise, make new friends, and find themselves a new hobby. Students don't get nearly enough exercise in gym class. It's always good for everyone to make new friends. Also, you can never have to many hobbies. Doing this is good for everybody, even the staff. The staff members that participate will be working more hours, therefore, they would be getting paid even more money. If you think I'm right and made some good points, then show this to someone that can make this a thing in schools near you.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

It would benefit the school and sports teams as well by having smarter hard working students.\nSchools have a lot of hardworking students but also have students who dont care and dont contribute to the school or themselves, making students participate in a sport, work on the year book, or serve on the student council would fix that. By making a student play sport you would make them work towards something out of school instead of just laying around, which would make the student a harder worker and benefit his grades. The sport would help the student have better ability to work with other people also giving them new friends to have fun with making school a more enjoyable place.

        "The principal, of the school, thinks that every student should participate in one or more extracurricular activities.\nThere are lots of students that would like this very much, and others wont be as thrilled if this is to come.\nSome students might not be able to participate in these activities, but will have to do them if they are required by the school, some students might have other sports outside of school, or students parents might want them home after school,and some just might not like what the school has to offer. Students shouldn't have to participateÂ in extracurricular activities.\nMost teenagers now, participate in sports or other activities in there everyday life, so it might be a lot harder to manage school, an after school activity, and a sport outside of school. One of my friends has soccer practice everyday after school, so she has to leave school early to get there on time, but if she had to stay after school she would miss soccer practice, or she might level early and miss her after school activity. No matter what she does she will still miss one of them, but if she didn't have to stay after school she wouldn't have to miss practice or get in trouble for not showing up after school.\nParents might want there children home as soon as possible because they might have a younger child at home that isn't old enough to stay home alone or might not be responsible enough, so if they have an older sibling that can take care of them, they will take the opportunity. As an example*, I have a younger sibling at home who gets out of school around 30Â minutes before me, and my mom dose notÂ like it when shes home alone so when I come home from school I have to stay home until my mom comes home. Most of my friends have younger siblings, so if we all had to stay after school we would have to let our younger siblings stay home alone and our parents might not like that. Another thing parents might want there children home for is chores, if students stay after school they will have less time at home and wont have have time to complete all of there chores or get their homework done, plus some students may have sports or other activities so they would have even less time.\nThen there are the students like me, who dont have any interest in sports or talking in front of random people, students who do this will have to participate in sorts and work on teams and will most likely put little to no effort in what there doing and are only doing it because it is required by the school. Some students may like to play sports and make yearbooks but they might not like the sports the school has to offer or they might not like the people on the team, so again they might put very little effort in to what there doing. Others might just not be good at sports and prefer to read or draw rather then run around, throwing and catching stuff.\nIf students want to join a club or activity they should feel its because they want to and not because the school is making them do so, students should have freedom over joining extracurricular activities. All in all I believe that it would be better if the principal does not make extracurricular activities required.",

        'Students should be told to do at leastÂ one extracurricularÂ at school because doing an extracurricular can help students become more physically healthy, they can leave a lasting impression on their school and they can meet new people. All these can come from doing an extracurricular activity after school. I agree with this decision by the principal since most pupils will have good outcomes by doing an extracurricular activity. Students have a wide range of choices for their activity for example, students could choose to participate in sports such as baseball or basketball, work in the math club, the model U.N.\nAll the clubs you can think of the school most likelyÂ provides for their students to choose, however out of all the good reasons to force students to participate in these extra activities do have some setbacks. Some of these setbacks include the fact that maybe some students have responsibilities after school such as babysitting, jobs or religious reasons.\nFirst, Students who choose to be apart of clubs such as the Student Government or National Junior Honor Society can revolutionizeÂ their school and create change in rules that they do not favor as much as other rules. These clubs usually encourage free thinkers and people who wanna to create change and revitalize their school when it gets a little stale and boring. Some kids might join a sports team or musical ensemble and win a championship or a musical trophy that the school can proudly display like all the other trophies that the school has won. Most schools are very proud of their pupil\'s accomplishmentsÂ in or out of school usually displaying their accomplishments such as their students who went to the NBA like Kobe Bryant or became very famous actors like Tom Cruise.\nNelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the key to life and happiness"" and if that is true partially extracurricular can help you achieve that. As most colleges look at your application form they look at your Grades ACT and SAT but what they also look at is what extracurricular you are in such as clubs, sports teams or musical acts such as a band or ensemble.\nNext, students can become more physically healthy and fit when doing some activities after school. The main example of that is a school sports team that the students can join like track or swimming can help them lead a healthy lifestyle and lose weight while filling their requirements to do a school extracurricularÂ activity. These school sanctioned activities can help students become more fit and lose weight because of the sport. Sports in general are a good way to teach kids to be healthy and not sit at home all day and lay in bed or on a couch all day after school. Kids are easily impressionable to anything or anyone that tells them what they like such as a junk food commercial or a commercial for sugary cereal, these commercials tell them that the cereal that they are marketing is healthy but in reality it is just a sugary full of carbohydratesÂ cereal. By letting kids stay after and teaching them what foods are healthy for them or not we can reduce the impact that childhood obesity has caused the last couple of years.\nLastly, most students who participate in after schoolÂ activities can meet a lotÂ of new people who are interested in the same things as you are and you can talk to them in the clubs or other activities you have joined. Most people who join clubs are often interested in the same things as everyone else in that club, there even some clubs just about certain interests such as the anime club which is just a club for kids who like anime or manga. Other clubs and extracurricular are also good places to meet new people if you are new to a school and need people to talk to.\nthese friends you make can become lifelong friends of yours even out of school and into college or the workforce and adulthood. These bonds that you make in middle school and high schoolÂ can increase your social skills and help you with life skills like communication with other people, a skill needed in jobs like marketing where you most likely need to present in frontÂ of other people sometimes including your boss.\nIn conclusion, being told to do one extracurricular by your school isn\'t the end of the world you can make it fun by choosing a club or sport that you enjoy to do and it will not be a burden on you or your family. In these extra activities you can create a better you and show your school that, you can become healthier and you can always meet new people who share common interests with you. All the students are required to do an extracurricular most likely because the school just wants the best for you and your academic career whether that is from K-12 or beyond to college and the workforce extracurricular help you in many ways throughout your life, these clubs ensembles and teams can boost your self confidence, fortify your social skills while you have fun since you have chosen things that interest you and are not boring.',

        "There has always been extracurricular activities being offered in schools, even in my old house in Generic_City, but many students don't take advantage of these resources given to them. This is why I believe that students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. I make this claim for three reasons, the first of which being that students are more involved in the community that the school built around them. My second reason is that students doing sport related activities helps with exercise and having the need to stay in shape for the team and the school. Last but not least, my third reason is that students that may not have many friends could use these activities as a way to get to know people that are doing the same sport or are in the same band. So I believe that these extracurricular activities would be beneficial not only to the students but the school as a whole.\nFor my first reason I stated that doing an extracurricular activity helps students get involved in a community that was created around them. Students that join sports or other activities provided usually get to know others that participate in the same team or group that the student does. Another reason to back up my claim is that in clubs or competitive sports teams these students generally train together and help each otherÂ succeed in the task that they are working towards achieving. I believe that these activities would help tremendously with letting students get to know each other and further strengthening the schools community.\nMy second claim is that doing extracurricular sports help students get exercise that generally they would not get, had they not been told to do any exercise outside of school. If these students play for a school team (football, wrestling, etc.) there is intense training involved that from, personal experience, is not easy. Im not saying to go run a mile or anything but these sports try to get every competitor in great condition in order to get students to succeed in tournaments and bouts or matches against other teams. So there is a huge exercise component to most sport related activities.\nFor my third reason, let's start with a small story. So, imagine that there is a student that moves around every two to four years. it was pretty difficult to make friends so he generally stayed at home playing video gamesÂ by himself and didn't really go out at all. That was me until around three years ago and doing sports like wrestling and rugby have helped me make friends. So I understand how difficult it is to always be the new kid but these activities let me make friends and get to know people. Students that do these activities usually make friends with the people that have the same interests in activities.\nI believe that enforcing this rule would be beneficial not only to the school but the students as well and these reasons are why I believe in this rule. Communities get built around the students when they do these extracurricular activities. Physical fitness is also a big motivator for a few students with sports related activities. And last but not least, these students can make friends in these activities like I did when I used to move around a lot. Extracurricular activities would be a good service to enforce in schools.",

        "According to recent surveys, around 86% of students participate in extracurricular activities. Students playing sports or being in the year book club has been very beneficial for them. They can learn a lot from the activities, as well as representing the school. Participating in an extracurricular activity should be a requirement for the following reasons: Students will learn something new, students will gain life skills, and the school will see growth in their sport teams.\nFirst, students will learn something new. Not all students have participated in an extracurricular activity. Students who haven't done so, will be taught something they didn't know how to do. When I was in the sixth grade, a couple of my friends and I tried out for something we had never done before. We tried out for the middle school lacrosse team. We learned a lot from our coach and went from not knowing how to catch the ball, to being pretty decent at the sport. Not only can students learn something new, they can also gain life skills.\nSecond, students will learn life skills. Students will learn to show commitment, leadership, and responsibility. My father was a really good soccer player in high school and college. He tells me all the time about the three most important things: commitment, leadership, and responsibility. He also made it very important that I knew about the hardships of being on a travel team like he was on. He had to commit to playing soccer in all of his spare time, always practicing, he had to show leadership and get all the practices and games and help those in need, lastly, he had to show responsibility by making it to all the practices and games on time and prepared. This is why students will learn life skills. Not only can students benefit from extracurricular activities, the school can as well.\nThird, the school will see a growth of students coming to the school. These numbers help the school earn rewards and more money. When people see a school earning a bunch of rewards, they tend to switch to that school if they are in the same activity that is winning rewards. When the school gets more recognition, they will tend to get better players and will keep gaining rewards. One of my friends used to go to the same school as me but then he went to another school that had a better football team and was known for winning the division title. That school has gotten a ton of people to go to their school because of an extracurricular activity. This why the school will see a growth of students going to their school.\nHowever, others believe that students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity. They also say that students shouldn't have to be tied to school any longer than they already are. This wrong for several reasons: students will gain knowledge and life skills from these activities, students will have fun doing so, and students won't be at school for much longer than the normal school day. These activities are not just there to torture the students, they are there to help them excel and grow as a person. The activities will also prepare the students for the rest of their lives.\nIn conclusion, it should be a requirement for students to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students will learn something new, students will learn life skills, and the schools will see a growth of numbers in the activities available. These are reasons why students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. I hope that you will think about participating in an extracurricular activity.",

For example, doing different things such as clubs can help students connect to each other and help them to be more open around other people. If a student isn't good at being open, participating in an activity will be good for them. When a student doing somthing active it can be many different things. Sports can also make you more active by it being fun to the students. Students can also be active by helping the community around them such as recycling or donating. In activitys students can learn new things in many different ways. For example, if a student doesn't know what to do in their future, participating in an activity can help them find that. While students are doing things with other students, they can learn from each other to learn new things.\nIn conclusion it will be good for students to partcipate in a least one extracurricular activity. When students are partipating in different activities it can help them improve different skill sets and help them learn things.Â",

        "Make your own choices! You should be able to choose if you want to play sports or not. School is bad enough you shouldn't have to do something you do not want to do. Extracurricular activities are not for everyone. You should have the right to pick what you want to do.\nLife is full of choices not being told you can and can't do something. Activities like sports, yearbook staff, or serve on the student council is your choice nobody else can make them but you. Principals are just making sure the school is in order not to tell you that you have to play sports. People everyday make choices who told them to make the choice they told their selvesÂ to make the choice. You need to choose for yourself not be told by a high schoolÂ principal that you have to do something.\nMaking choices is how people live. If a principal thinks he can tell kids what they can and can't do he is in a world of hurt. School is the best years of your life and going through school doing what you are told by one person will get you nowhere in life. School is where you learn make friends and do what you want after it is over not be forced to do something. School is a lifetime of memories but doing what you are told creates no memories it creates really bad stories.\nSchool is fun and creates memories.

Nobody else can choose for you. After school activities are fun but not for everyone.\nIn conclusion being told to do an after school activity by your principal is not the kind of school to go to. Then in another sense being told by your parents is different. Your principal can't tell you to participate but your parents can. An after school activity is something you need to do if you want if now then go home and do whatever you want to do.

        "I would agree with the decision to make all students participate in after school activity. I would agree with this decision for a couple of different reasons. One of them would be bringing people together. Parents may start to think and appreciate the teachers more for going above and beyond staying after schoolÂ to work with there kids. This would paint a new path and a new picture for the schools future.\nNot only only would extracurricular activities get more students and teachers working together forming good relations, but it would help students see teachers and the school in a new light. Students may start to appreciateÂ there teachers more and may start to like them. Students could feel more confident with there teachers because they share some of the same interests. Not only this but the teachers may get to see how hard working there students are working outside of school, and maybe the students just need a push or in other words a little bit of help.\nI feel like parents also would appreciateÂ getting the kids off there butts and getting them to interact with there fellow teachers and students. By making encouragingÂ there kids to have a open mind about after schoolÂ activitiesÂ they could also find out what there schools offer and possibly the parents could be interested. The students who look at taking after schoolÂ activitiesÂ with a good attitude will get hooked and find something they really enjoy. When the students come home from there extracurricular activities they could tell there parents all about it and maybe teach there parents something they dont know.\nWhen you sign up or good to a after schoolÂ activity try and go with at leastÂ one friend who is also interested in the same topic. This will give you a safe feeling and you will have someone to share the fun with you! Not only will you have one friend there but if you bring a friend there is a 100% chance you will make more friends there. The teachers will find it very excitingÂ you found a extracurricular activity you enjoy and made new friends. With all the work you will be doing in your after school activity at leastÂ when it gets hard you will have a friend next to you to make it better.\nIn conclusion I think this is a very positiveÂ decisionÂ made by the principal and agree with it completely. There are so many benefits to going to after school activities. Meeting new people and finding interests you may have never new about. For all you know you could have found a career you love and want to do as a job. Finding new friends and meeting new teachers and strengthening you relationship with your teachers is a very smart thing to do. I would highly recommend other schools to do the same as this school and help your students find a activity they love.",

        "Do you want to be forced to work on something? No one does and if a school makes you do an extracurricular activity thats whats going to happen. If we have activities in school, then the after schoolÂ activity would have to be after school. There is a reason why we have P.E, FACS, coding, and stuff like that. We have those classes so that we dont have to do after schoolÂ activity.\nThe first reason why students shouldnt have to do extracurricular activities is because they could already be doing and activity. Whether its Babysitting siblings, playing with toys at home, playing video games, doing sports, or even doing a cooking class. Those are good activities, and even better, its an activity that they like. what if the student doesnt like any of the activity choices given to them. That could be bad for the child. Its like making a person eat when their full already, And to add onto this, The child could also be going somewhere already like out to eat, going to their moms house, dads house, friends house or a restaurant\nAnother reason schools shouldnt make kids do extracurricular activities is because after a long day of school or work you want to just chill and sit down, listen to relaxing music, drink soda, eat food, and all that good stuff. What if your school took away that time from you? That wouldnt be that great because then you have no down time. another thing you could do in this free time is study, do homework, and even work on some other stuff. this time could give student more time to complete and understand their homework. This would make the student more focus and responsive during class.\nThe last reason I have for disagreeing with making kids participate in extracurricular activities isÂ because the kids pick up time would change. some parents that go to work everyday get sleepy. they want to sleep after work just like the child does after school. parents get sleepy fast and thats because they have a lot to deal with. If schools dont do this, than the after school stuff wont be a problem. another reason is because the parent could be working afternoon hours the day that the child has to be picked up. Then the parent is going to freak out and try to get someone to get the child for you. the next reason is because the parent doseÂ notÂ have enough time to pick up the chi;d. and the last reason is because maybe you dont have the money to drive miles to you son or daughtersÂ school.\nIn Conclusion, if schools dont make kids do extracurricular activities, then none of this will happen. So I say we should save the troubles and just not do it. Treat people how you want to be treated. I think this is mean to the children because I feel like the children should have a say in what they want to do.",

        "Students may not always make the best decisions,but we still chose what we wanted to do whether it would affect us or not. We don't make all of the decisions, because we have parents, guardians, and sometimes teachers to help us stay on the right track. However, if a person is in a spot where they could control what we do,like a principal, than their decisions could make things a whole lot worse or better. If our principal forces us to do an extracurricular activity, than I would say\nNo!\nThe reason why is because, We might get stuck with an activity that we've never done, We might have to miss it because of other important matters, and finally if we miss it, we would have to deal with the repercussions\nFirst things first, we have an extracurricular activity that we might not know or be familiar with at all. If the principal just assigned everyone to a random extracurricular activity(lets assume that thats what happened and that we could notÂ change it.) than the chances of people particularly knowing that activity go down by a lot. If you are not a type of kid who hates to run around, or, you have asthma and you can't run,what if he accidentally enrolls you into the soccer club. You go up and tell the instructor that you can't run and they say, thats fine, but, the principal will be somewhat mad that you can't do the program. \"\"I guess i'll ask himÂ to get you a different one this time.\"\"Or what if you get stuck with a game like cricket. It is extremely hard to learn how to play that game, and it also is super hard for newcomers. If you were stuck with something like that, than you are not going to have fun with it.\nNext one up, The game that you cannot show up for (After school activities).Lets say that you were chosen to be on the student council and you have a meeting after school. UnfortunatelyÂ you have a therapists appointment after school at the same time. Will the principal force you too stay or will he let you go like he should do. You might have soccer practice for the junior league championship game that is coming up but you have to sit in a chair and talk about the budget for the Shrek junior play instead. It just would'nt work out with allÂ of the problems, and also the fact that all kids are different and that they should'nt be forced to stay after and miss something important because of their extracurricular activity after school. I just feel like they should let us do what we need to do after school and not bother us with after school extracurricular activities.\nLast things last, The cruel and unusual punishments for missing these extracurricular activities. The principal would punish those who either missed his extracurriculars or made a fuss about them. it would usually range from detention to having to eat lunch in another room. However, if you miss 3 after school curriculars than he would call your parents, 6 he would suspend you, and 10 or more he would expel you, (Permanently). He did do a good job of enforcing his rules too. He has resource officers and they will tell the principal if you have been missing out on his after school activities. The principal really is no joke, so i recommend stayingÂ on his nice list. Even though I still don't agree with him at all for doing this.\nIn Conclusion, No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might, and besides, thats just my opinion and i'm just a kid so what do I know. All i know that it is time to wrap up everything here and it is time for me too leave. I will be taking my leave now,it was surprisingly fun while it lasted, alright, enough with the dawdling see you later, I guess.",

I have so many memories and unforgettable moments from my basketball season and I made many friends. Yesterday I was greeted by Generic_Name, one of the three seniors from basketball,""Hey Generic_Name!"" she said with a big smile as she walked back to softball practice. Basketball season ended a month ago, but the team bond and relationships continue on. Everyone should have the amazing experience I did of being involved in an extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal\'s decision for all students to participate in one after schoolÂ activity because of the importance to our school community, building character, and the lasting impact.\nParticipating in after school activities is important to our school community as a whole. Within a school, positive relationships are key to a beneficial education as well as experience for each student. Throughout extracurricular activities students build relationships with others through common interests. Such as through sports, you develop a relationship with your team. You crave to get out on the court or field to play the game you both love and look forward to seeing each and everyone of your teammates.\nParticipation in programs will help to develop and build the character of each student. Students exercise real life skills that are needed for the workplace. Each program is centered around teamwork which requires collaboration, communication, and compromising which are key components of many jobs. Other skills developed within these programs include leadership by demonstrating through example and time-managementÂ skills by deadlines for assignments. Getting involved in a programÂ may spark your interest in a future career such as a reporter, lawyer, or a political figure.\nExtracurricular activities have a lasting impact. The word impact is a two sided word, it is not only what we are impacted by it is who we impact as well. Each program is made up of a diverse group of students from different backgrounds bringing different perspectives. Everyone has a story to share of their journey, we are inspired by others stories and impacted by their personalities and action they take. Each story or action has a different impact, perhaps the desire to change the world or to look at something with a new perspective. The relationships and inspiration sparked by after schoolÂ programs have a two-sided impact.\nI agree with our principal and believe that every student should participate in an after school program because of the impact sparked by relationships and the development of many skills. Whether it is tennis or serving on the student counsel, I encourage you to get involved in an after school activity because it will no doubt bring more energy and joy to your life. There are a sea of options to choose from. Take a little time from your day to check out the bulletin board beside the main office to view the after school activities posted there. I promise you will not regret it; it will change your life and world for the better.',

        "I think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and i completely agree with the principal. Students might not have any plans after school, but what would be better than being in a after school club with a group of your peers. Or for athletic students they could be on one of the sports teams. Having students be in a extracurricular activity is a win-win in every situation. I think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it could help students with their school work, it can be a opportunity for students to become more social and make new friends, and it could help students get to know the school and staff and make the school a better learning environment.\nSome students might need help in some of their classes. So because of that reason they could be in an extracurricular club like study hall or homework club. Students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. If a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. Sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. These are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes.\nBy being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people. Some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school. They could meet those who they share common interest like video games for example and could bond over those things. Or people who like sports and like to talk about sports. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for students to bond and get to know the people they go to school with.\nBeing in these extracurricular activities students can get to know the school and staff better and make their school a better learning environment for themselves and others. Some students might not know a lot of information about the school they're attending. But with these activities students can connect with their teachers and staff on a deeper level and get to know them more. This could also help them in the classroom. By knowing more about their school they could contribute to making their school a better learning, safe, and fun environment to be in. This is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment.\nI think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and it should be implemented into the school. There are a lot of great things and opportunities coming from this decision. It can help students more than just academically. It can also help them socially. They can connect more with their school and make it a better place. In conclusion these are the reasons I agree with the principal and I think all students should be in at least one extracurricular activity.",

        "Have you ever done an extracurricular activity? Did you like it? My principal has decided that everyone must take part in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with his decision because some students may not have time, no one to take them, or not enough money.\nStudents may not have enough time to do everything they need to do and go somewhere. Sometimes they have to finish their studying, homework, and go to a game or practice. They could also have a job or have to help out on a farm. For example, I had so much homework and studying to do, but I could not get it all done and go to practice. As a result I stayed home and did my homework and studying instead of going to practice. Because I did not have enough time, I could not do an extracurricular activity.\nSome students do not have someone to take them to games and practices. Their parents may not be able to take them because they work late or they have to go somewhere after work. One time my mom had to work late but, I also had cheer practice. Because I had no one to take me to practice, I had to stay home and miss a practice.\nSome times students can not participate because their families do not have enough money. Their parents need money so they can take them to and from places; also, they have to pay to get in games and for insurance. One time I wanted to do dance, but I could not do it because we did not have enough money. Because we did not have enough money to pay for it, I was not able to do an extracurricular activity.\nMy principal recently decided that every student must do an activity.

        "An extracurricular activity by nature is designed to be optional, something that students can join to support their hobby. Sports are a popular example, because if you are enrolled in the school, you don't have to spend extra money to join a sports team. This is great news for the people interested in all the sports their school has to offer. But not everyone wants to join the sports team. Even if you take into account all the other extracurricular activities at school, there will still be people who aren't interested in any of them, and it would be impossible to cover all categories and hobbies of every student at school to make an activity for each of them. This is why I believe the ability to opt out of an extracurricular activity is a fundamental part of the activity itself, hence the \"\"extra\"\" in the name, and I'm going to tell you why forcing students to participate in one is a very bad idea.\nLet's say for this example we single out one particular student, and this student's name is Generic_Name. Let's also say that Generic_Name has a hobby of creating and collecting model airplanes, to display on the shelf of his room. Generic_Name's hobby isn't a very common one, but that's okay. He prefers to build them alone, in the quiet of his room, and maybe share pictures of them online with another small group of model airplane enthusiasts. Generic_Name chooses to spend most of his free time doing this, and he enjoys it. Unless he can't, because the school just made that choice for him, and now Generic_Name has to sign up for an extracurricular activity. Generic_Name's school doesn't have a model airplane building club, as most schools don't, so Generic_Name is forced to spend his free time doing something he doesn't enjoy. He barely has any time to invest into his real hobby anymore, since he has to spend all afternoon at the chess club. As his happiness plummets, so do his grades. The school has nothing to really gain, and certainly a lot to lose, by implementing this system.\nThis leads me to my next point, which is also a question. What does the school gain by putting this rule in place? What benefits does the school get by forcing each and every student to participate in an extracurricular activity? Are they not taking into account the amount of protests to this rule, or the amount of students who will skip the extracurricular activity anyway? What could make them want to introduce this rule so badly, that they would ignore all of the negative consequences that come with it? There is no reason that I can think of that could support this rule even being thought of. A rule like not being allowed to chew gum at school, while pretty silly, still has a reason. It's so that students won't stick their chewed gum underneath the table, and while I would never do something like that, I still completely understand and can get behind this rule. This is in stark contrast to a rule like forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity, where I couldn't think of a single reason for it's existence.\nAll in all, I think adding this rule to any school would only lead to disaster. It only brings negative consequences to both involved parties, and if there are any schools already with this rule, they would most certainly be better off without it. There isn't a single reason I can think of for a rule like this to be made. These are all the reasons why I think forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is a very bad idea.

Why should a student be forced into an activity when they have chores? what about the amount of extra stress? Plus, sports and yearbook aren't everyone's favorite thing.\nAs stated before, some kids don't have time for things like activities. A student might have to babysit a sibling, do chores, work around the house, or even have a job!\nThere's no reason for making extra activities mandatory. Meetings early in the morning? Less sleep for growing children. After school? There's enough at home to handle. Even the middle of class wouldn't work, as the student would fall behind.\nNot only will it mess up a kids schedule, it'll cause stress. Life can be stressful for students. Especially when dealing with tests, quizzes, and changes to the student. Add in an activity that'll cause them to have less distressing time and you'll have a meltdown waiting to happen. You can't expect a student to be able to handle that. If students actively pick an activity to do, it's because they know they can handle the time management.\nAnd finally, Not everyone is going to be interested. Sure, the students might be cool with it for the first week, but then it'll be bothersome and annoying. Activities should be optional, not mandatory. It takes the fun out of everything. Whether you let the students pick or not, it won't matter. Not everyone wants to join the sports team. Not everyone wants to work for the yearbook. Some people would prefer going home and relaxing at the end of the day.\nWhile it seems like a good idea, mandatory participation should't be a thing. Most kids are trying to spend time with family, not giving them time to do sports. Some people might already be stressing over tests and grades, causing more stress in activities. And let's not forget that not everyone would be interested in kicking a ball around or painting. It may be for the best, but it's also the worst to make activities mandatory.",

        "What if everybody did have an after school activity? Would it technically be a good thing? I disagree with the principle. I think that requiring everybody to have an extra curricular would be too demanding. There are also more reasons why I disagree with the principle. I will be writing about the reasons that I disagree with the principle.\nSome kids don'd do extra curricular activities because they have stuff home and family related. Some kids wouldn't have a ride back home from these activities. Now, I know that your thinking, \"\"Can't they ask their friends?\"\" But honestly, is there every friend for every person who doesn't have a ride? Why do you think there is a such thing as a taxi now? And some children, including myself, live farther away than most kids in their school. Not many parents are willing to drive far away for a child that isn't theirs. Also, there are some religions that do certain rituals on a daily basis, at certain times. Like prayers, or temple visits, etc: Some children just have a bed time. So not every one could make it to these activities.\nA lot of children that do after school activities have homework and chores to do when they come home. There would be a less likely chance of these getting done, if everybody had an after school activity. Some kids struggle while they are at school, and they use their time at home to study and try to help gain their academic skills. If they are like me, a lot of kids can't really focus at school and usually finish projects and stuff of that sort at home. Some children just can't balance school and extra curricular activities and either stop doing the activity, or lack academically.\nAlong with the other things that I mentioned, some parents/guardians of the students can't afford the extra things that go along with doing these activities. For example: A lot of boys could play sports like basketball and football, but there are expenses to these things. You have to buy helmets, knee pads, shoulder pads, shoes, socks, food for games, and practice attire. Even things other than sports require paying something. Things like art supplies, musical instruments, money for costumes or outfits. There are some after school activities that don't require money, but most do. I have met a majority of kids' parents that just don't want to pay the money for the sport that their child wants to do.\nThese are some of the reasons that I disagree with the principle. They are valid and practical. I'm thinking about the many reasons why kids don't do after school activities and why it is important to understand these kinds of situations. I have met many kids who has wanted to do a sport, but can't because of a valid reason, like the ones I have listed. You have to take into consideration why everyone isn't doing an extra curricular activity now, and be satisfied with the ones that try and/or do.Â Â",

        "Most schools have extracurricular activities, such as playing sports or working on the yearbook. Most students enjoy these activities and are grateful to have the chance to participate in them. In the majority of schools, a student is not required to take part in one of these activities. However, if the principal of a school were to decide that all students must participate in one, then their decision should be supported because the extracurricular activities will help students find new interests, they will allow them to meet people with similar interests, and skills such as teamwork will be encouraged.\nOne reason in support of a principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities is that they help people find new interests. Often times, a student may assume that a certain activity is boring or a waste of their time. However, this is impossible to know until it is tried out. After trying it out, the student may realize that it is fun, and a great way to spend their free time. Sometimes, a student may simply think that they do not have the time to participate in a club or a sport after school. However, after doing it once and realizing how much they enjoy the activity, they may reconsider whether or not they do not have much time. Both of these scenarios result in the student having a good time, and this enjoyment can only be credited to the principal, as they are the reason why the student participated in an activity. So, by being forced to be in a club or sport, students will expand their amount of hobbies and interests.\nAnother reason why the principal made a good decision is that it will allow students to meet those with similar interests. If everyone has to do an extracurricular activity, they will all go to the one that they are most interested in. For example, those who like taking photos may go to yearbook club. Now, all of those who have the same hobbies are together, and they will most likely become friends, as they can bond over their interests. This was only possible because of the principal's decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities.\nThe last reason why the decision to make students participate in extracurricular activities was a good one is that it encourages skills, such as teamwork or persistence. In most sports, such as basketball or soccer, teamwork is a skill that is always used. The players must communicate with each other to make the best play. They must encourage each other, and keep them from getting nervous. Teamwork will also be used when students grow up. Many jobs will require employees to work in a team to complete their work. By practicing this skill earlier, students will be better prepared for when they grow up. Another skill that is encouraged is persistence. If one gives up after facing a problem, no work can get done. For example, if one is taking part in a mathematics club, they will have to solve a variety of problems. Some may seem like they have no solution. However, if the student gives up after they cannot find a solution, they will not learn anything. Also, they will be ill-prepared for when they grow up and face a myriad of other challenges. If, when they face these challenges, they just give up, they will not be able to do all they are supposed to do. By participating in extracurricular activities, students will not grow up without these skills, and can instead accomplish everything they need to, and more. The one who is responsible for this is the principal, who made students take part in these activities.\nIn conclusion, a principal's decision to require students to participate in extracurricular activities is a good one because students will find new interests, make new friends, and build skills that are absolutely necessary in adult life. By taking part in these activities, students will both enjoy themselves, and they will gain the skills needed throughout their life.Â",

I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it allows students to socialize and collaborate with their peers, as well as meet people with the same interests. All while doing an activity they enjoy.\nTaking part in an after schoolÂ or extracurricular activity lets you socialize and collaborate with friends you may already have, or students that you haven't met yet.Â EitherÂ way it's a great way to have fun and build a better relationship with your peers. Communication and collaboration skills are some of the most important skills in life. Going to extracurricular activities lets you practice and use those skills. Additionally, when students work with peers they share the knowledge and skills that they already have with each other, so in addition to what they're learning in the activity, they are learning new things from each other.\nExtracurricular activities give students the chance to meet people with the same interests;\nattending one or more of these activities allows students to engage with one another.\nThis is good because some students can be shy when trying to make new friends because they can't start a conversation.\nExtracurricular activities gives students that are more shy the opportunity to talk to one another and begin a friendship, because meeting people with the same interests as yourself are a lot easier to talk to. This can all happen while playing a game of chess, basketball, or other extracurricular activities.\nIn conclusion, the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity should be a simple decision because these activities are a great way to practice life skills like communication and collaboration. As well as the perfect place to meet people with the same interests. This will also provide students who are more shy the opportunity to talk to their peers, make friends, and create friendly relationships with the people around them.

        "Many students play a sport or are involved with an activity such as a club, student council, and even NJHS (National Junior Honors Society) as well as other in school or outside of school activities. Most students go home everyday and relax the whole time and don't feel the need to exercise or do anything. This can start to take affect on their health and mental well being or even cause them to not care about school as much as to say someone who plays a sport for their school and attends clubs after school. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity or multiple activities of their choice for the benefit of their health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about.\nPlaying a sport is a healthy and enjoyable thing to add to your life. Sports help increase your endurance, muscle tone, overall health, and even helps you lose weight. Students who play sports tend to be less tired during the day and are much healthier than say a student who stays inside all day and doesn't play outside with friends or plays a sport. By adding a sport to your life, it gives you plenty of exercise and workouts each day and allows you to keep in shape and stay healthy.\nWhen school is over, many students only think about how they're going to relax that day or what they're going to eat as soon as they get home. Most students don't really have much to do the rest of their day and often get bored most days after school. By doing an extracurricular activity such as a sport or club, it allows you to eliminate that boredom and have something to do either everyday or at least a few times a week. You can have something to look forward to everyday at least and can do something you love instead of sitting on the couch waiting for tomorrow to come. It's best to choose an activity you really like, by doing something you love, it makes it both enjoyable and makes you feel less stressful since it's an activity you really like and enjoy.\nSome students find school very challenging or have mental disabilities that prevent them from easily completing school and gives them challenges they have to figure out how to overcome. School clubs such as homework clubs or even clubs that are dedicated to a specific subject or idea can help a student really understand the content they're learning about and help make it easier to focus in class and not struggle as much. Clubs that are dedicated to certain ideas or subjects often learn more about that subject or idea because of the fact that it mainly focuses on specific content or a wide range of data related to a certain genre. By joining a club, you immediately learn more than you would in a class because it's a more open learning environment and different people share their knowledge instead of maybe 1 teacher.\nI do agree that our principal should make all students participate in an extracurricular activity because of the benefits for your health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about. Everyone should find an activity they love to do and add it to their life to benefit them even if it's multiple activities.",

        "Would you like to be forced to choose an extracurricular activity that you don't like?\nThe principal's idea of all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because not every students like extracurricular activity, there are not a variety of activities to choose from, and some students already participates in some extracurricular activities outside of school.\nTo began with, participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because not every students likes extracurricular activities.\nExtracurricular activities are not everyone's favorite, most students would rather do their school work than extracurricular activities.\nOne reason for that is the amount of work the students are receiving.\nThe teachers are giving students an extremeÂ amount of work that the student's interest towards extracurricular activities has declined.\nA way to fix the problem is to make the lessons less ornate, and more simple.\nIn addition, participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because there isn't a variety of choices for the students. The school has some choices for extracurricular activities such as sports, year book, and student council.\nThere are not many selections that are available for them.\nFor example, if a student doesn't have a favorite choice, then they would be forced to choose something they don't favor.\nThat would diminish their view towards school and the principal.\nThe school can create more choices for the students to pick from, and it could make a difference.\nLast, participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because many students already participates in some kind of extracurricular activities outside of school. Extracurricular activities such as swimming which is not possible to be done in school.\nI think schools should focus on the main subjects such as Math, Science, and English, and not extracurricular activities.\nEven if there are extracurricular activities in school, there should be a choice for it.\nIn conclusion, the principal's idea of all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because not every students like extracurricular activity, there are not aÂ varietyÂ of activities to choose from, and some students already participates in an extracurricular activities outside of school.\nExtracurricular activities should be a choice not a must.\nI hope the principal uses my ideas to make the extracurricular activities more suitable for the students.Â Â",

I agree with this decision because students would get more experience inÂ school, they would become more productive, and parents would have more time to work.\nOne reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because students would gain experience from it. If students participate in extracurricular activities they could gain experience from the the things they learned and the mistakes they made. For example, I am part of The Ambassadors Club, and this program has taught me how to manage my time, how to work with other people, and how to efficiently get work done, which I will need as I'm growing up. Students would get new experience if they participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\nAnother reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it will help the students become more productive. Most students at home have nothing to do, so they fill that time up by going on their phones, playing video games, or getting into trouble. One example would be myself because I am lazy, and I love to procrastinate. I would usually get my work done last minute, and I would always do the bare minimum. So, I decided to join a club at school, and I chose Drama Club. The club was very fun and exciting, and I learned a lot of new acting skills. Ever since I joined the Drama Club I have stopped procrastinating, and I have been more productive in school and at home. I believe that if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity they would be become more productive and would stay out of trouble.\nMy last reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it would give their parents more time to work. Many students have parents who work long hours, and their parents might have to hire a babysitter or might have to enroll their child into daycare, which both are very expensive. Parents might not have enough money to provide their children with a babysitter or day care, so they have to get off work early so they can take care of their child/children. For example, my sister, who goes to the same school as me, comes home at around 2:30 pm, but my parents don't come home until around 4:00 pm. So our parents had to hire a babysitter, but all of the babysitters were to expensive, so our parents had to get off of work early just to take care of her and to make sure that she is safe. After a month of leaving work early, my mom signed my sister up for Step Team, which my sister says is really fun. Now my parents don't have to leave work early because of the extra hour and a half that my sister is at Step Team. If students participate in at least one extracurricular activity their parents would be able to work more, and they would be able to earn more money to provide for their children.\nAll in all, parents would have more time to work, students would be more productive, and they would get more experience if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. However, some people might think the new system is bad because students would want to relax or hang out with friends, but I believe that their are a lot more positive effects if students participate in an extracurricular activity.

        "So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason. Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason. Not to be on the electronics all day that would'nt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives becauseÂ you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people would'nt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport.\nReason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too.\nReason number two everyone should do something in there lives should'nt be lazy because that would'nt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lotÂ of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason.\nReason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. won't have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time you'll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play.\nThats all my reason I hope that a lotÂ of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life is'nt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment. So thats all I have to say about being a leader not a follower like do something once again u only live once make ur life go big. Â",

        "Doing extracurricular activitys is like having field day, they are fun and you can do many different activitys. The principal wants all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activitys. Here are some reasons I agree to having extracurricular activitys for all students. For, it can help build social skillls, it can give students a chance to exercise, and can decrease boredem and stress.\nTo begin with, building social skills is an good way to make new friends for example, you can make new friends by joinging new clubs, meeting new people such as coaches, and learing and sharing new ideas between people in your activity. Some students may be shy when it comes to new people; joining clubs like bookclub and art is a great way to find people that has the same interest as you.\nNext, many students may want a chance to exercise by joining sports. Joining different sport teams can help with exercise for example, track can increase your cardiovascular indurance and build your speed. Using sport activitys can teach students how to exercise and how to be healthy.\nAlso, students may want to join extracurricular activitys to decrease boredem and stress. Joining these activitys can get your head out of stressing situations. Say you failed a test you would not feel so great afterwards but to get your mind out of it you can go to your extracurricular class and study more for your next test of get you mind off things. Serving as student council can decrease boredem by setting up school dances and a bunch of other fun activitys.\nHowever, some students may disagree and not want to participate in extracurricular activitys due to being lazy, grades, or behavior. When students are to lazy they tend to skip out on things like sports. Grades are a big part in not being able to join a extracurricular activity due to lack of doing homework, or not participating in class. Behavior in some students may affect them from joining a club too because their mother or father may want them to change their behavior first.\nIn conclusion, I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activitys. For, it can help build their social skillls, students can get chances to exercise, and decrease boredem and stress. These are great ways for students to make new friends and build goals for the future.",

        "Wouldn't it be awesome to always have something to do at the end of a long boring school day. Extracurricular activities give you that chance. I believe that everyone should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity every school year. I think this because of all the benefits. Also, every extracurricular activity has a different advantage. The extracurricular activities I think everyone should be a part of are: sports, academic, and different clubs.\nThe first, and my personal favorite, extracurricular activity is sports teams. Sports teams create a way for kids to get exercise. Kids are recommended to exercise 60 minutes each day. Joining a sports team ensures that you reach that goal. Not only would it be healthy, but the student would feel good about him/herself. Teamwork is also and benefit to joining a sports team. Teamwork is one of the most important skills. It's one of the the only skills people absolutely need to be successful in life. Sports teams are one of the best ways to practice and get better at that skill. Another skill acquired in sports teams is leadership. In sports teams leadership is always a reoccurring skill. You also need to show leadership throughout you life, similar to teamwork. Some may be a bit shy and not necessarily know how to correctly take a lead in situations, but sports teams could definitely fix that.Â To think this is only one of the types of extracurricular activities to choose from, doesn't it already seem worth your time?\nThe next option for an extracurricular activity is the academic workshops you're able to join. Academic workshops and clubs can push students to do better. In these academic workshops you surround yourself with people who want to be better, and are better than you. Surrounding yourself with people who are better than you encourages you to do better for yourself and pride. Academic workshops may also improve your grades a little or a lot depending on how dedicated you are to do so. There are workshops like homework club that help students who need a little more help and guidance than others. If these particular students participate in these types of things, they're sure to see and improvement anytime soon.\nLastly, there are so many different types of clubs any student could be a part of and interested in. Everybody should try something new every once in a while. The different clubs that schools have are the perfect opportunity. I'm going to introduce you to two of the clubs that sparked my interest. First is the yearbook club. Doesn't it just sound fun by its name? Wouldn't you want to be a part of the book that everyone raves about at the end of the year? You get to take pictures, make fun subtitles/caption, and so much more. Sometimes you even get extra credit for it. Seems like a deal breaker to me. Then there'sÂ student council. This is probably my favorite clubs to be a part of. It's very intriguing to see what it's like to be somewhat of a politician. Student council is also an awesome opportunity to show your teamwork and leadership skills strengthened by sports teams. Besides, wouldn't it be fun to basically be at the head of the school. Think about it, these are just two of the hundreds of clubs you're able to choose from.\nI believe every student should be a part of at least one extracurricular activity. Sports teams help push exercise, and strengthen teamwork and leadership. Academic workshops encourage better grades and motivates students to do better. There are also opportunities for student to try new things with the different types of clubs. Think of how well rounded a student would be by participating in one of these extracurricular activities every school year.Â",

There are many benefits, long term and short term, to doing extracurricular activities. If extracurricular activities are made mandatory, it can help students overcome fears and find things they're passionate about. Making extracurricular activities compulsory for students will help them by creating new friendships, helping them get into collage and giving students new experiences.\nMaking extracurricular activities compulsory will help students make friends and build relationships. Engaging in extracurricularÂ activities will help students find people they have something in common with. For example, last year I was in the green eagles club and I met a lot of people I might not have hung out with otherwise. Going to clubs and after school activities will help student meet people they would not usually be friends with and help broaden your perspectives.\nMany students are shy and have a hard time making friends, but if extracurricularÂ activities are made mandatory it will help pull them out if their shells and develop social skills which are incredibly important throughout life. Having all student go to extracurricular activities will also introduce kids to many different types of people so that they have a better view of the world.\nEngaging in extracurricular activities can help you get into a good collage. While collages will look at your grades, they will also look at your extracurricular activities. Collages want not only smart people but also well rounded people who have many interests and will bring something to their school. When I asked my cousin, who goes to Generic_School, about when he applied for collage he said that collages will look at tons of people with good grades but what makes you stand out is your extracurricular activities and the extra things you do. Therefore, if it's mandatory for kids to do extracurricular activities, they will have a higher chance of getting into a good collage and this will help them in the long run.\nTaking part in extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ will give students new experiences. WhetherÂ it's being in an uncomfortable situation or just hanging out with your friends, your experiences are important because they are part of what shapes who you are as a person. If students take part in extracurricular activities, they might even find something they truly enjoy doing. Being in an extracurricular activity will expose students to other ideas and cultures which will in turn broaden their perspectives and make them more empathetic. When I was in sixth grade and I told one of my friends I was vegetarian, she said sorry, looking at me with pity. After a while she learned that I chose to be vegetarian, and that I enjoy it. This changed her perspective on what vegetarians are like and has made her more aware. When you expose kids to ideas, especially controversial ones, it helps them start to formulate their own opinions bases of of what they think and not what others tell them to think. It is very important that all people are exposed to others who are different to themselves and if all students take extracurricular activities, they will benefit through learning about their peers.\nBuilding relationships with people is an important skill that will be used throughout life and extracurricular activities will force students to be in positions where they will make friends. In the long run,Â extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ will help you in many ways such as getting you into a good collage which will eventually help you lead a good life. Taking extra curricular activities will make you a more well rounded and aware person and might even help you discover a passion. On top of this, by taking an extracurricular activity, students will gain new experiences which will broaden their perspectives. It is vital that students are exposed to other cultures and types of people because this will over all help to shape their out look on the world and make them more empathetic human beings. If extracurricular activities become mandatory, students will benefit because, they will make friends, it will help them get into collage, and give students new experiences.",

Extracurricular activities like sports, working on the yearbook, or serving in the student council can contribute a lot to a student's view on school. In addition to this, students will pay more attention to their grades and behavior. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is a great way for them to learn new things, get a break from learning all day, and get to socialize and make more friends.\nIn school, many students dislike to learn new things. By having one extracurricular activity, students will have a great way of learning new things. Sports are something we usually do during gym class, but in gym class at our school we move fast through any unit that we do.Â Having at least one extracurricular activity will give students a chance to enjoy participating in sports that they like. Also students will get to learn more about this sport and even later on join a team. There are a lot of creative students at my school. Students who want to learn about photography, drawing, and constructing things will have a great opportunity to by joining a extracurricular activity that involves this. I would like to add on that when I joined a drawing club, I learned many new things like blending colors. Additionally, training on your mindset is very important. By having a extracurricular activity like chess or board games, students will get to learn how to play board games that they have been wanting to try. Learning new things from extracurricular activities could be very helpful to students because later on they might have a chance to use this information.\nLearning all day can be very hard on some students.

In addition to this, having a break from learning can make students feel more relieved and they will pay more attention during class. If students decide to join extracurricular activities like drawing, they will be able to calm down. It has been a proven fact that drawing will make you calm down, so by doing a extracurricular activity, students will be at ease and contribute more during class. Learning all day is very stressful and takes a lot of energy, so therefore students should participate in calm and relaxing extracurricular activities that will give them a break from school and at the same time help them pay more attention toward school.\nSocializing is something that some shy students struggle with. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to make more friends and socialize. As a shy person, when I first came to my school I was struggling to find some good friends that I could trust. Later on I decided to join a chess club and a drawing club and I made great friends. Joining a extracurricular activity can give shy students a way to to train on socializing, meaning that they could practice how to socialize and even overcome their fear of socializing by talking to people in their extracurricular activity. At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there. Extracurricular activities are very helpful towards students who want to make some friends and socialize, so therefore making students participate in at least one is necessary.\nStudents should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is very helpful for them.

You are sitting in a disorganized mess trying to figure out what to put on your college resume before the deadline, which happens to be in exactly two hours. This could have been prevented if you had actually done any extracurricular activities in the past. To prevent these types of scenarios, all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can give them future opportunities, make them gain many skills, and help them find a passion to pursue.\nEveryone wants many opportunities in life, and extracurricular activities do just that. If you play an instrument, you can travel abroad to play your favorite pieces. You can join competitions and get recognized so that orchestras and symphonies ask you to play with them. It is not just playing an instrument that can get you opportunities, but sports too. If your team makes championships, you both can travel places for that competition. We cannot forget about college scouts either. If they see you play and they think you are good enough to be on their team, then they could give you a full-ride scholarship to their school. If that is not an amazing opportunity, then I don't know what is.\nThe next reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can learn many valuable skills they will need in the future. In leadership clubs like National Honor Society or your school's student council, you can learn how to communicate with people and get your ideas out. You can also learn to lead people, plan or organize events, and help your community. You can even overcome almost everyone's biggest fear, public speaking. That is definitely a huge benefit. With sports, you can also not only build up your communication skills, but also learn to collaborate by becoming a team player. If you are in a chess club, you can gain patience and critical thinking skills which will definitely help you in the future.\nThe last reason why all students should participate in extracurricular activities is so that they can find a passion to pursue. Sometimes, people do not always know what they want to do or become someday and extracurricularÂ activities just happen to help with that. By doing them, you can find out your interests and hobbies, what you are good and bad at, and what abilities you posses. If you love that sport or that instrument, pursue it! Work harder than anyone, and you just might find yourself in the Olympics. Practice with your whole heart and soul and next thing you know, you could be inviting your family to come see you perform with the National Symphony. The point is, all these passions can start from you just wanting to try out an activity.\nOverall, students should definitely participate in extracurricular activities. These activities can bring you many opportunities, valuable skills, and help you pursue a passion you never knew you had. There are so many more reasons to participate in extracurricular activities, but these are some of the most beneficial ones. If you had chosen any of the hundreds of extracurricular activities available, you would not be frantically trying to finish up your college resume two hours before it is due. Instead, you could have been stress free doing what you love the most.",

        "Many people participate in after school activities. Choosing to do so but some people prefer going home and resting after the long school day. But what if your principal said you have to participate in an extracurricular activity in order to go to this school. This may help you in many ways it could provide a way to talk and socialize with friends or make new ones. If it was a sport that involves any type of moving it would make you more fit and healthy. I would agree with the principals idea it introduces the kids to many things they have not done before and they might not of known they liked it or were good at it.\nThere are many benefits in extracurricular activities that you might not of known. Whether it would help you now or in the future. It is very healthy to participate in any activity because it can help you physically and even mentally improving your ability with your social skills in the result of you talking with your teammates or other people constantly. And how it can help you physically is in basically any sport you play. Your moving around constantly improving your endurance and strength it makes you more fit and healthy.\nWhile there are many advantages with this idea every idea comes with some disadvantages. But I have ways to counter them. Some people are not as fortunate as us and many sports have a fee to sign up as a result to that some families might not be able to afford that fee. So the school fills that gap from the cliff stopping that student from participating offering many activities that do not require a fee or any sort of paying. And if they do the school can fill that gap with the extra money they have, you can even donate to the school so the school can keep providing their students with the money they need in order to sign up.\nA lot of sports have practices almost every nightÂ and it might last until 9:00. So when you get home your exhausted and you don't feel like doing your homework or any project thats due soon. And its hard to find the time to do it. In the result of that the school makes the study halls or resources longer so you have time to finish your homework, essay, or school project. This will take the stress off of the students and let them sleep for a healthy amount of time instead of staying up late trying to finish that project.\nthe after school activity does not have to be a sport. It could be volunteering for school council or fightingÂ for the the best design of the yearbook. This also comes with a lot of benefits. Designing the year book is not an easy task trying to make the best possible one making you use your imagination as hard as you ever had making the most unique and creative one. So the judges would select yours as the winner. And volunteering for student council is just as hard to trying to satisfy all of the students needs and opinions making ideas that are mature but also good this makes you think out of the box and your comfort zone.\nOverall the principles Idea is a very good one that will improve the liveliness of the school. Making every student active is very important because it improves their mental health and physicall health. It will also help the students in the future providing scholarships for them to big colleges and programs. Making them feel more comfortable in front of bigger crowds. Students might not like the principles idea now but will thank him a couple years down the road.",

        "My Principal has decided that every student must do an extracirricularÂ activity in school. Most people disagree with this statement but I think otherwise. I agree with my principal because it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.\nThere are many students that sit inside, and dont go outside as much as the are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracirricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. there are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.\nanother good reason to have everyone do an extracirricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. . All the exercise in fooball is physical, working your legs and arms to burn off fat and build muscle. But you can also improve your confidence and determination.\nFinally we have extracirricular activities acting as a great outlet for kids who have family problems and/or are bullied. Most kids who have big problems dont like to open up about them because they feel like they'll be judged or made fun of, but if they are on an engaging sports team, or are working on the yearbook they could have someone to speak with that they trust, or just something to get their mind off of their personal problems.\nI hope this helped you get another perspective on how extracirricular activities could help our school. it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.",

        "There are a lot of bright sides when it comes to extracurricular activities. Some may include college, but if you make all the students in one school participate in at least one.. That's going to be hectic. It's also going to be super stressful. I disagree with this sudden change because, an abundance of kids here have personal issues, the high school doesn't have enough room, and some kids might not want to participate.\nYou never know what's happening in a person's life, unless they tell you about it. Someone might have to babysit their baby brother, until their mom comes home. Additionally, some kids that go to this school, their parents don't have a car. They probably take the bus, to and from work. So how are they going to get home after school? Exactly. So not everyone can play a sport or work on the yearbook. Some kids seriously don't have time for that. You have to be considerate of other people's problems.\nThe high school does not have enough room for every kid who wants to play a sport. I personally run track, and I love it. But there's already too many people on the team. I get that the high school has absolutely nothing to do with the middle school, but they control our afternoon sports. And what's the point of spending more money to hire more sport coaches for the middle school when we have some next door. That's a waste of money. So, if you just let the kids who are in 8th grade and want to try out for a sport, do their thing. We could all totally avoid being on a team with 60 people in it. Not to be rude or anything, but let's be honest.. Who actually wants to serve in the student council or work on the yearbook.\nWhen I say, \"\"some people might not actually want to participate.\"\" I'm referring to the lazy students. You can't actually force us to do anything after school hours. I'm totally sure that is illegal. However, if it's something related to homework, that's a totally different story. Not many people want to do anything after school. You may not see it, but a lot of students here are depressed. Please don't even try to say, \"\"an extracurricular might help them.\"\" It won't. They need to see their doctor, not you. Let us do what we want in our free time, that we legally don't have to be here at school. Y'all adults can work on the yearbook. And whoever wants to be on the student council, and whoever wanna play a sport. Let them, on their own free will.\nBasically what I'm saying is, everyone has a different POV/reason on why they do or don't do a extracurricular activity. You shouldn't force it on us because you want too, without reasoning. Be understanding and respectful of other people's time, and they might just thank you for it in the future. Â Â Â Â",

        "Have you ever wondered how active you are or how active you could be? Many students have hidden skills, but do not want to use them due to their laziness or lack of interest. If many students are lazy, it could heavily impact their future in a negative way or make them miss out on something that could be extraordinary.Â If the principal were to add a mandatory extracurricular activity, it would come with a lot of pros that can help them in the future. I believe that extracurricular activities would be beneficial because of its way to build stronger relationships with your peers, train your body to be in good shape, and could increase hidden skills that can attract people who will reward you with money, prizes and a lot of opprutunites.\nStudents around the world are consumed by loneliness or boredom, but that could change with extracurricular activities. If students were to take extracurricular activities, they could be making amazing relationships that could change their lives. For example, a student could be playing basketball and make strategies with his/her peers to win the game. This could help with your listening skills, as well as athletic abilities which are key components to build good bonds with the people around you. But while your playing with your friends, you are also exercising your body to participate in these activities.\nHealth is a key part to your life and you would be damaging your health if you just sit around, eating junk food, and watching TV. If you decide to take an activity where movement is involved, you will be able to incorporate a lot of exercise in your day. While you move, you are also exercising and losing calories. This could help you lose body fat, encourage you to do more activities to stay fit, or help you focus in school or your activity. Staying in good shape will open so many opprutunites for you to improve or succeed. If you get skilled enough with extracurricular activities, people could reward you with items or opportunities that could change your life for the better.\nSkills are a key component to become successful at school, your home or an extracurricular activity that you are taking. If you get skilled enough, people who notice you will be able to help you or reward you for the skill that you are good at. People like coaches, famous artists or singers could recruit you to an activity that could change your life. A student could be making a painting that is as good as the Mona Lisa, or a student could be so skilled that he could compete with famous basketball players like Lebron James or Kyrie Irving. This could all happen if a student were to take a extracurricular activity and put time into their activity.\nIn conclusion, mandatory extracurricular activities would be beneficial due to all of its opprutunites that it can offer. You could be the popular kid at school with all your new friends, be in good shape so that you can limit your chances of any health problems, or get recruited by people with amazing skills so that they can change your life for the better. Some students are not as motivated as they use to be. All they want to do is stare at their phones for excess hours or look for the best way to cause drama. Unless these students do extracurricular activities, they wont be a significant change and that is why it should be mandatory. They could miss out on something special, or never find their hidden talent. Extracurricular activities could change your life in many ways that you thought were impossible. If you put time into your activity, you never know what could happen, maybe you could be the next legend of your decade, or even century.",

        "Should students really be forced to commit to an extracurricular activity for school? Many children are already committed to activities outside of school. School is very important, but students have lives outside of the school environment. When you commit to something you should put your best effort in to it, but if you are occupied with other things it is very hard to give it your all. The principal should not implement this rule because kids are given homework, they are committed to other activities outside of school, and spending time with your family is essential.\nMost children receive homework from teachers, and there is no doubt about that. Homework is important to better an understanding of a topic that is taught at school, but it can get very stressful at times. Most children spend sleepless nights trying to complete homework for the amount of classes they have. Children usually have an activity outside of school so adding that to the mix with all the homework can be hectic. It is way to much pressure to try to get good grades when there is so much to handle and you also have to remember the fact that we are kids that are still growing up.\nStudents are committed to other activities, teams, and programs outside of school. Would they have to quit doing that activity because they are just to stressed to handle it all? Schedules would not only shift for students but for the parents of those students. Aren't we supposed to get eight hours of sleep every night, but then how do us students do that when there is to much pressure placed on us? Teachers expect us to focus on the material they teach us at school, but that is going to be very difficult and I don't think teachers want to teach kids who don't want to be taught.\nSpending time with family is so important. We spend most of our days at school and doing other activities that it's nice to take a break. I mean if we have so many activities then that's taking away family time. I love my family and I know most kids do too, so I would like to spend as much time as I can with them. This is just one of the negative effects of having to do an extracurricular activity.\nAlthough, doing an activity is good I don't think that students should be forced to do one. It should ultimately be their choice because it can come with some negative effects. Homework, other activities, and spending time with your loved ones can be effected. The principal's rule is something I would not be here for, or would not think is the best call to make. All the stress that can come from the rule could be horrible and essentiallyÂ effect the performance that students do at school.Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Imagine having to take off work because the club you're in has to get together. You have to tell your mom you needed to sacrifice your work hours and won't make enough money to buy this week's groceries. By requiring kids to be apart of an extracurricular activity, difficluties similar to this start to emerge in their home life. I don't think schools should require kids to be apart of an extracurricular activity because not all kids can afford to be in one, parents are working and can't provide 2 transportation, and some kids are needed at their homes and can't leave to go to the activity.\nOne problem that shows requiring kids to be apart of an afterschool activity is not a smart choice is the fact that not everyone can afford to get the equipment needed for the activites. For example, if someone chooses to join the softball team, they would have to invest in softball cleats, a helment, shin guards, and much more supplies that were required to play. Sports equipment is not the cheapest, and not everyone has the means to pay for everything all at once. Also, a lot of clubs have a joining fee on top of all the equipment that's needed to be purchased, which doesn't make choosing an extracurricular any easier. Kids should be given the choice to join a club and if they choose to not join anything, that's their personal decision which deserves to be respected.\nAnother reason why joining an extracurricular activitiy should be optional is because a lot of parents are working and can't take the time off to drive their kid to club meetings or practices. There are other ways you could get to practice, like carpool or walking, but you can't put that type of pressure on somebody else's parent all the time and some people don't feel comfortable walking places. On top of that, parents don't always have extra money for gas and having to drive their kid to and from school more often than they normally would need to wastes a large amount of it. This is showing that it's hard for parents to have to drive their kid everywhere and it would be best to let kids decide if they can be apart of an extracurricular activty or not.\nLastly, every family has problems of some sort, some of which might require kids to be at their house as much as possible. For example, some kids have really young siblings that they have to watch as soon as they get back from school, which would take up all the time that they would spend at an afterschool activity. It's also possible that some families might be planning on moving houses soon and would need their kids to help them pack whenever they were avaliable. This would cause kids to have to be at home as much as they could and wouldn't leave any extra time to be in an afterschool activity. Being apart of an extracurricular activity is a decision made by kids and their parents and shouldn't be forced by anybody.\nIn conclusion, kids shouldn't be required to be apart of an extracurricular activity because it's very costly, it's hard for parents to provide transportation all of the time, and some kids are needed at their homes more often than not which gives them little or no free time. It wouldn't be fair for kids to be forced into doing something that would make their life harder, therefore schools should keep on giving them a choice.",

        'The principal decided to put everyone in an extracurricular class and the students disagree with this decision, if we take extracurricular activities they will be energy, wasting time, and a waste of money.\nExtracurricular activities are a waste of time, instead of being at a meeting for student council we could be home enjoying are families and friends while we can. These activities will just make it harder for us to wake up stable and functional for a new day at school especially sports. No one wants to stay three hours after school for a meeting with some other kids then have our parents pick us up. Those teachers/coaches also need to go home on time to get home to spend time with their families so keeping them here for extra hours is not the best idea.\nThese activities wont be cheap, the equipment for football, soccarball,baseball,basketball wont be cheap they will cost a lot of money. Football equipment will at leastÂ coat 10,000$ because of the gear that is bought every season and the 100 yard field that needs to be cleaned every month. Basketball equipment will probably cost the same because of the jerseys bought every season and the basketball court that is polished every week. Soccarball will not cost as much as football, because the only thing the school is buying is the jerseys and gear, they already have the football field to play on.\nBy the time we get home from these extracurricular activities we will be completely sore or completely tired and we need a good nights sleep to function, so why make us lose our good nights sleep just for an activity, We need to be able to wake up in the morning and say ""ahhhh another day"" and smile instead of "" dang it man school sucks"" and get mad. These activities will completely blow us out, make us not want to come to school, and deplete the energy right out of us. We need to come to school with a good attitude and good vibes not tired grouchy/grumpy, in conclusion the idea of the activities is good but the outcome is not, when we wake up the next day from the activity we will not be able to function at all, the school will just be wasting money ont these activities, and wasting other peoples time.',

Some students may not be as smart as others when it comes to learning in school but, that should not mean that they should not have as much of an opportunity to be as successful as others could be, so giving them a chance to see something that you might really be good at or just enjoy is great.\nOne extracurricular activity is playing a sport like soccer, football, basketball, or track. Students need to be as successful as possible when it comes to giving them the future some students can only depend on playing sports to be successful in life. Giving them the ability to play sports in school is an amazing decision beacuse it could have a lot more benifts then people excpect, some students are naturally born with a talent for basketball or football, or even drawing so making them choose an extracurricular activity, could have them discover something they never knew they could do.\nMany students do not have anything to do once they finish there school work, they may not have the money to buy a computer to play on or an xbox. By having them do an extracurricular activity like chess or something you are giving them the abilty to see other things they can do when they are bored.

        "Sports and extracurricular activities are very common in today's schools, yet in recent years the number of students who participate in these has diminished.Â One of the few top causes are, technology, lack of drive, and higher levels of stress.Â Therefore I feel, that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity to, aid in finding peers with similar interest, be stress beneficial, and drive students with the enticement of competition.\nFirst and foremost, this will aid in finding peers with similar interest because, we are more often than not, on social media or are on our phones more intrigued in what somebody else is doing, or where they are going than what we are doing with their own lives.Â A prime example of this, is that people won't sign up for something they don't like.Â So people in chess club most likely want to be there, that is something everyone there has in common.Â Plus if we participate in multiple clubs or activities and the same people are in them to, they probably have similar interest that could lead to companionship.Â With this added benefit of friendship it opens a whole new door of opportunities for us.Â It means that we can have someone there for support or someone to go hangout with in the future.Â It can also drive us to take more risk in our life and open us to new opportunities like a new food or activity that we may enjoy.\nSecondly, a lot of students, especially in late middle to high school, are under a exponential amount of stress.Â This can cause them to do are think about harmful or life threatening activities to them or others.Â To prevent this, it would be wise for us to be in a place where we can express ourselves and let off some steam. Extracurricular activities fulfill this need for relief in our lives, and A few of the ways it does this is exposure to the community by, travel, community service, or self influence in the community.Â Another benefit is time management, many students, my self included, struggle with time management because we are constantly over run by massive a amount of knowledge from the day or week, so that leads us to give to much or little time to self benefit.Â This leads to higher levels of stress when we don't have time to do anything on the spot.Â I have first hand experience with this where just the other day I came home after a long and dreadful day where I was to tired to do anything so I simply fell asleep even though I had plans to go with my friends that evening, but was famished of energy from school.\nLastly, it opens up a window of opportunity when it comes to competition.Â As human beings we strive to be the best in life. We want to have, the style, the smarts, and the popularity in life.Â With that said, clubs and sports allow for that through competition.Â For some they get to express their leadership skills, for others they get to home in on their teamwork skills and on the very rare occasion it teaches some to be humble with loss.Â Competition gives a sense of unity with each other because everyone is working toward the same goal, winning, and it can also build confidence though leadership.Â A good example is a sport coach, in some sports one of the players is actually the coach, and having that job is often a way to build confidence because it gives a sense of power to them.Â Even losing can help them, for some they feel that winning is the only thing in life so they get all worked up about it. So when they lose and understand that its not a bad thing. It helps them learn not to be so stressed about winning, and I used to be that way, but because I learned that I can lose and it won't kill me, I have enjoyed life more.\nIn conclusion, I feel that having us participate in a extracurricular activity is a highly beneficial idea that will allow for us to enjoy life with a higher acceptance. It will let us make more friends with similar interest, allow for us to be less stressed in life, and give us a higher sense of confidence in life. All of this leads to the fact of enjoying life to the fullest and sharing that with others instead of being secluded and stressed in life which is where a lot of the student population is right now in comparison to a couple of decades ago.",

Most people that do extracurricularÂ have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.\nOne reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my gradeÂ that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.\nFurthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after schoolÂ club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.\nTherefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after schoolÂ to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high schoolÂ early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.\nStudents making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new.Â Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life. Â Â Â Â",

Lastly, some students may struggle with their grades. In conlcusion, students might not have the time, not have any interest in any activity, and having low grades are all reasons that extracurricular activities shouldn't be required.\nFirst of all, students may not have time to participate in extracurricular activities. For example, a student may have to stay after school for extra help with assignments. Or, the student does alot participating with their religion. The student may find it hard to balance their activities through the day. All together, fitting all their day to day activities in one day could be hard for a student.\nSecond, the student may not find an interest in any activities provided by the school. Every student has different interest. One student may like sports, another music, or maybe even working on the yearbook. There could be students though that don't find interest in any of those activities. So, students shouldn't be forced to participate in any activilty they don't enjoy.\nLastly, some students may struggle with their grades. Some students may find it hard to keep their grade up. Alot of the time, the coach or teacher won't let students participate with low grades. The students low grades could get them kicked off their team or anything they are participating in.

        "Your principle states that you are required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you think this is a good idea? would this effect you on a daily basis or in real world situations? Participating in extracurricular activities has many factors and I agree with the decision of having all students participate in an activity. There are many pros to having everyone participate because there are many different activities you can participate in also you can learn important lessons and skills also participating in an activity keeps you occupied.\nOne of the reasons i agree is because there are many different activities to choose from so everyone can find something they enjoy doing. If you enjoy playing sports joining a sports team at your school would be a good a way for you to stay active and create great friendships and bonds with people you play with. There are many different clubs you could join too, If you like taking pictures and being involved around the school working on the yearbook would be a good extracurricular choice for you. If you like making a change or you see a problem at your school joining the school council would be a good way to help your school out and make a change. As I have stated there are many different activities you could participate in so you could always find something you enjoy.\nHaving kids participate in extracurricular activities can also help you learn many important lessons and skills. Joining an activity can help you become more responsible because when your participating in an activity you have to make sure you stay on task also you have to make sure you are on time and do what your supposed to do. If you follow the rules and tasks you are given, this can help you become more responsible as you get older. You also learn how to make friendships. Having every kid participate in an activity helps people make friendships and talk to other people. This is a good way to interact with others and you can use this skill as you get older. Another important skill you learn is communication. In everyÂ activity communication is a big key to being successful in what you do because if your working with other people you need to make sure you understand whats happening and what you need to do so you need communication. As I have stated these are some important lessons and skills you can learn while joining a extracurricular activity.\nParticipating in an activity also helps you stay occupied and busy. Some activities take place after school so instead of staying home and sitting on your phone or watching TV you get to participate in an activity which gets you up and moving. Also being in an activity keeps you active because if your playing a sport or in a club where exerciseÂ is involved that keeps you moving and healthy. Another pro is that sometimes being in activities can be a distraction for you and help you get out of trouble because instead of going somewhere with your friends that can possibly get you in trouble you are doing something productive and good. As I have listed being in an extracurricular activityÂ is a good way to stay occupied and get good things done.\nAs I have stated these are some of the reasons I think its a good idea for everyone to participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many different activities for people to participate in also you can learn important skills and lessons also participating keeps you occupied. I hope my reasons convinced you that everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity is a good idea and many good things come out of joining one. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "If a principle were to make all kids participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity, what would kids and parents think? It could quite possibly go either way, a hit or a miss.\nMost of the kids that go to school are antisocial, and what most extracurricular activities are about is communicating, for example, running a play in football, calling for the ball in basketball, talking to other kids in the student council. And that's most definitely not fair to the kids who are not very sociable. Besides, you also have to try out for sports, so if you happened to not make the team, your stuck with something you don't like.\nAlthough some students may not be sociable, this rule could open some new doors for them, finding a new passion, or something they do in a extracurricular activities might just be their job when they get older.\nParents may also get very involved as well, everybody knows that if a parent sees their child unhappy, they'll do everything in there power to stop or put and end to it. And I personally don't think that schools want a swarm of angry parents trying to change some tiny rule.\nBecause no matter where you go, visit, or travel everybody'sÂ different! The world is a very diverse and unique place, full of humans with all sorts of different opinions and views.

The point I'm getting at is there are a lotÂ of opportunities you can have with extracurricular activities. Don't like sports or dont want to move around to much?\nDon't worry, there are plenty of other things you can do. Maybe you like photography you can join the Yearbook club or the Earths Wonders club.

Dont worry though there are a lot more things you can do like maybe you are a creative person and like to paint, sketch, or draw. You may like the Art club full of great artists.\nThere is also a lot of musical opportunities such as Choir, and Band. In Choir you will be able to sing to your hearts content, go on trips, and sing in concerts. Maybe you dont like to sing you may like band. Band is a purely instrumental group composed of Brass, Percussion, Woodwind, and even Strings. If you like to make music, those are your best choices.\nDon't like music and instead like to read.

If you like watching TV come on down to the Netflix club or Anime club.\nIf none of that sounds enjoyable or maybe cooking is your calling, our school holds a Culinary Arts club to help students learn and master the art of cooking.\nlastly, there is the Teachers For Tomorrow, a group of students willing to teach the next generation of students. We also hold a EthicalÂ Hacking and Computer skills class for those who like technology.

        "Say your principle has made a new rule this year that you must participate in a minimum of one after school activity. This means it will force kids to take action and try something new with a extracurricular activity. I hope my school does this because it will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.\nMy first reason why this would be a good idea is because students will make new friends. We all know there are some of those kids that are anti social and do not like to talk to that many people. But if you force them to do an after school activity, they will make new friends in that program. This can make their self esteem rise as their circle of friends grows. Even if you are not one of those anti social people, you can still meet many different types of people annd make cool friends. If you are taking the same after school activity, that mean you guys both like that same thing. This will make it even easier to meet new people that share your interests.\nMy second reason why this would be a good decision by your principle is because it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer. By some peoples senior year, there may be some seniors that took so many after school activities, that the school loves them because it shows how much they want to learn and get involved. You may get an award at graduation or some recongnition for participating in so many extracurricular activities. I know someone who does a sport, works on the yearbook, and is on the debate team. This shows they want to learn and is a good sign for the teachers at the school. This represents to teachers that he is a well rounded student. Most extracurricular activites also go on your high school trans script. This means colleges will see you were involved with many programs at your high school and it will strengthen your chance to get into better colleges.\nMy third and final reason why this rule should be added by your principal is because it is something new to try. Maybe you have never even thought about going on the debate team because you thought you would never like that. You try it anyways because of this new rule and you turn out to be really good at it and now you have a new hobby. With this new rule forcing students to take part in extracurricular activities, it can expand someones personality by trying things they would never have tried before. It is always good to try new things because it can give you an idea of things that you like and do not like. By trying new things out in after school activities, it will help shape what you want to do with your life as you go through high school.\nThere are really no bad things that can happen with after school activities. You may get stuck in something that you do not like that much, but that is just practicing perserverance and determination. hope my principle will add this new rule forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It will cause students to make new friends, it gets you more involved in the school and the programs that they offer, and it is something new to try.",

        "Have you ever come home from school and been bored, because you have nothing to do? Fortunately enough for you, there are tons of extracurricular activities available. I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first reason I believe this, is that students are able to try a new activity and meet new people. In addition to that, students can learn teamwork and make friends from an extracurricular. Finally, students participating in an extracurricular learn how to balance school work on on top of their activity.\nWhen students try new activities, they can discover things about themselves and new people with common interests. Students may discover a talent or interest in something that they never knew they had. For example, if a person has never kicked a soccer ball, then they will not know whether they're good at it or they like it. Furthermore, even if students come to find that they don't like their extracurricular, they can still use this experience in the future. Just like when a person tries a new food, if that individual doesn't like it, then they will remember. The students can then use their knowledge to avoid what they don't like in the future. Last, it is beneficial to try a new activity, because you may meet someone you don't know who has similar interests to yours. Meeting these new people with common interests can lead to new friendships, that never would have happened. Trying a new extracurricular allows students to learn more about themselves and meet new people.\nParticipating in group activities is very important to students. For example, teamwork can be learned by practicing and working with a team in an extracurricular. In an extracurricular it is crucial that team members trust, rely, and work with each other to achieve the common goal. Secondly, using this teamwork to collaborate and accomplish goals, can lead to new friendships. When a student learns to trust and work with a team member within a extracurricular, they can also trust and collaborate with that person outside of the extracurricular. Last but not least, being able to work in a group is a very important skill that people look for when they are hiring for jobs. Companies look for teamwork in their employees, because co-workers need to be able to collaborate and respect each other to do their jobs efficiently. Activities that schools offer teach an important lesson about teamwork, that can create new friendships and be used outside of school.\nPartaking in an extracurricular and school at the same time has many benefits. The first of those being, that participating in an activity and school at the same time teaches students the manage their time. Adding an extracurricular on top of schoolwork can only be done if the student learns to use all of their time wisely. This time management allows a person to do more things they love to do. If a person can be efficient and not procrastinate on things they have to do, they will have leftover time to do whatever they want. The final reason a student should attend school and do an extracurricular, is that time managementÂ is a necessary life skill that students must learn. In the future students may need to balance a family, work, and make time for themselves all at the same time. Participating in school and an extracurricular teaches students a valuable life lesson about time management, that can allow these students to do what they love.\nI think that all students in school must partake in at least one extracurricular. I think this, because students can get new experiences and meet new people, while trying a new activity. Not only that, activities students participate in can teach teamwork that can lead to new friendships. My last reason for believing this is that, taking part in school and extracurricular activities gives students a lesson about how to manage time wisely. I believe that all schools should require students to partake in an extracurricular.",

Because one it would keep every student focused on something positive. Second it could help them get into college or get a good job. Not to mention it could give them learning experiences and keep them out of trouble.\nOne reason I believe that it would be a good idea is because it would keep students focused on something. For example if a kid decides to try out a sport they could fall in love with it so they work hard at it. So not only could they put that work ethic in the sport they could also put it in the classroom. This can also ready students for the work world when you have to be motivated to do stuff.\nAnother benefit of every kid doing a extra activity is that it could help get them into a college. Like if you do volunteering at an old folks home that could help out a lot. Or if you did something like charity work. playing sports can also help you get into a good college. Not only could that help with getting in college but also help you get a job, etc.\nAlso if you do activities it can help you stay out of trouble. EspeciallyÂ if your a kid that does get in trouble a lot this can help you eliminate bad influences , distractions, etc. it can also give you good learning experiences. So if you have an activity going on it will help you greatly with staying out of trouble.\nTo conclude I think extra curricular activities would be very positive for students. It could help your work ethic. It can help you focus your time and every in to something positive. Help you with getting into college or a job. It can also help you stay out of trouble.",

Their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day. I think kids should have to do extracurricular activities because you make new friends, you help out your school, and it creates other opportunities.\nWhile doing extracurricular activities you can make new friends. Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.\nSome extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot. It may be in a small way but it still helps. Groups that make the yearbook or students that serve on the student council are helping the school out. They are helping to keep the school in order and to keep students happy. Other extracurricular activitiesÂ like football and basketball help their school and community by winning games this helps the school make money, it helps the community by providing entertainment. Some schools even have environmental clubs that help the school, the community, and even the world. All in all, extracurricular activities help the school and community.\nMost importantly extra curricular activities create more opportunities. When doing extracurricular activitiesÂ you might find out that you are really good at something. People that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college. You might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing. Also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college. ExtracurricularÂ activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding.\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities have a lot of benefits. They can help you make friends, help your school and community, and create new opportunities. People may not want to do extracurricular activities but it will help you out later on in life and you will have plenty of fun.Â",

        "I joined a extracurricular activity and made a lot of friends in the process, 1 of myÂ best friends is actually someone i met during a extracurricular activity, his name is Generic_Name and we met through football. I agree with having students being in a extracurricular activity because you make more friends, become more social with better communication skills, and you might find a activity that you like to do.\nOne of the reasons why I think it's good for people to have more friends is so you dont have to deal with loneliness. Being lonely is something that no one wants to go through. You might have a great personality or a really cool talent, but no one is willing try and get to know you. Nobody wants to sit at the lunch table by themselves, or have a class with no friends in it either. And also people want to be known as the \"\"cool kid\"\" or something of that nature, which isn't a bad idea. But if you make friends with people who act just like you then that'llÂ be a lot better than hanging out with the cool kids.\nAnother reason on why its good to have friends is so school isn't as boring. Walking around in the halls by yourself, sitting in a class with no friends, or jogging in P.E. by yourself is boring. If you have friends then he or she will invite you out to do stuff, so it also makes life at home more fun.\nmy last reason on why it is good to have friends is because a good friend can make your day a lotÂ better. If your team just lost the championship and your sad then hanging out with your best friend might not be a bad idea. Or if something is bothering you then a friend can tell when something is wrong with you,and he or she will try to make you feel better or if they have to leave you alone then they will. A good friend should want the best for you,they should make you feel happy. However, if a friend is always putting you down, making you sad, or can't make you feel good about yourself, then that person isn't a good friend.\nSome of the reasons why i think having good communication skills and being more social is good is so making newÂ friends isn't hard for you. If you have bad communication skills then making new friends might not be easy for you. And since your not that good you might not even try to make new friends because you might not even try to make new friends because you probably think that you might come off as weird, and you wont get that personÂ to be your friend. But if you participate in a after school activity then your social skills will grow, and you will also know how to talk to different kinds of people.\nLastly, i think its good to be social and good at communicating in the real world. In the real world you will most likely be working with someone else. If your a doctor, do sports, or something along the lines of working with other people, then having good communication skills would make your job easier. If you have bad communication then your job will beÂ harder and you might not like it as much because of the people you work with.\nMy final reason on why iÂ think students should participate in a after school activity is because if they find something they like to do. If a student is doesÂ a sport like basketball and he or she likes it, then that person might want to play basketball something around that topic. Maybe they dont want to be a basketball player but instead a coach or a physical trainer. Or maybe they just want to be in shape so that their body can do a physical activityÂ at its full potential.\nJoining a after school activity doesnt seem so bad, i think theirs a lot more benefits if you do it than if you dont. Meeting new people,making new friends, being more social, and communicating better with others seems like you have a lot to gain.\nMy reasons for why the school should put kids in a extracurricularÂ activity are making new friends,have better social and communication skills, and they might find a activity that they like, i agree that the principal should enforce this rule and i hope i could convince other people to support my opinion.",

        "I disagree with this because the principal shouldnt have to make everyone do at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons on students dont have to do a activity because some students might have anxiety, work around the house, or homework. Some students might have anxiety because they probably been bullied by classmates and other times they probably grew up in a rough life. Some students do work around the house like some kids live in a farm and they have to take care of animals, and some kids might babysit their siblings. The principal dont know some of the kids went through in their life. For instance, some kids probably got abused, homeless, and foster care. So the principal should ask about how they feel about they feel about the changes of the school activities. Most students dont like sports because coaches push them a lotÂ or there not interested. When a student is behind in school and they have to make up work it takes them time. Some kids dont have time for yearbook or student council. People dont like yearbook clubs because they have to work on a page and it takes days to finish. Some students cant do student council because they cant behave, focus, and be responsible. I have few more thoughts. When it comes to sports parents dont allow there child to eligible to play any sports like football because the injuries, concussions, and even deaths. Students might have body issues for sports like leukemia, and schlolisosis. So I think students doesnt have to do at least one after school activity. Some students dont have the grades to be eligible for a sport like they have 3 F's. Finally some students have to do other sports out of school like wrestling and the gym. So I think students shouldnt have to do at least one activity.",

        "Your principal has decided that all student must participate in or at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree with this? I agree with the principal because kids need to get out and make new friends, learn how to work with others and do better in school.\nOne reason, to make friends can help you because you will see life in there or a different way. You can learn new things about them. Let's say you guys are playing basketball an one of the boys did a lay up, you can teach or show them a different type of move they can do in basketball like how to shoot when you are 6ft away from the net and not miss. It can help prove your low self stream and help you become brave or bold because you know that your friends will have your back.Â There was this one thing when my school sister(friend) cyan had my back when there was people picking on me about my shoes in 7th grade she told them to leave me alone and you are so mean and rude. From that day on we are still the best of friends/ school sister.\nFor an example, you can learn how to work with others. Learn from other people can teach you new things.\nLike cooking someone can show you or teach you they recipes and you can do the same. A lotÂ of people have a different ways of see things like in photographer you have one way ofÂ seem one thing and someone else can see a another way, but if you can put or come together with both ideas you guys can both make a amazing picture. Work together mean there will have to be teamwork like everyone has a job to do to get the work done and they can feel like the are part of this team.\nFinally, do better in school. Extracurricular activity can help you in school because some of this activity you will need to have good grades in your classes in order to be there. I know in basketball and cheer you can't get in trouble like get in fight, suspicion and get bad grades. Yes it must seem a lot of work but it not, but real it's a lot of fun. Your attitude will be much better and so will your attendance.\nAt lastly, make new friends, learn how to work with others, and do better in school. Your principal has decided that all student must participate in or at least one extracurricular activity. I belive that by do this we can make the world a better place.

      essay:
        "I believe after-school activities should be a requirement made by every school across America. After-school activities have proven to help students with a variety of things in their school years. For example, students get easily recognized by various amounts of colleges for the activity they are doing. Another reason is it helps students make friends with people who enjoy the same things as them. Last but not least, it also allows students to experience something new and prepare them for the future. If my principal were to make my friends and I to do an extracurricular activity, I would agree to it. It is something to do and it is enjoyable. I think students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it helps students get noticed by colleges, it gives them a chance to make friends, and it gives them preparation for the future.\nFirstly, after-school activities give students a chance to get watched by colleges. Extracurricular activities are one of the main things colleges look for. For example, my brother signed up for\nB-Tech to do engineering. After hearing about it,\nVirginia Tech started watching him and has invited him to their campus plenty of times. Along with getting noticed, students also have a chance of getting scholarships. Scholarships are a huge deal to many kids and teens who want to go to college. Although earning a scholarship is like getting into\nThe Olympics , it is still possible and it doesn't hurt to try. Scholaships have been helpful to many athletes and doctors throughout the years, so why wouldn't they be helpful to the kids who want to succeed as well? After all, it can be helpful to anyone, and perhaps a student is striving to earn one right now.\nAnother reason students should join an activity is it helps them make friends. Making friends in an environment students enjoy is the easiest way to make friends. The students who are in the same activity probably enjoy some of the same things as the other kids around them, making it easier to converse with them. It also teaches students to be more outgoing, which can help them with future problems, like speaking up. Students can be more comfortable and confident around kids just like them. Even if kids don't want to make new friends, they can join a club with their current friends and spend more time with them. Having friends within the activity can prevent the activity from being boring. Lastly, not only can it help students make friends in the activity, but it shows that the students involved might be interested in something other kids might have notÂ expected from them. This makes them more attractive, enjoyable, and unpredictable, which are characteristics that help attract friends.\nAlong with the other reasons, activities can help prepare students for the future. These activities require time management, which is something many kids don't understand or haven't learned. Time management is helpful for the future when students get jobs and need to work out hours with their boss. It not only helps with time management, but what students want to do in the future as well. Students aren't prone to enjoy the first club they try or even the fifth, but it can help them find a new hobby. A new hobby may not seem like a big deal, but it can end up being what the student wants to do in the future and go to college for. It also trains them for that profession they want to succeed in. High schools have the availability of many different clubs and activities, so why not try them? Students have the capability of joining something, and if they don't like it, at least they tried it and now they know not to do it later in life.\nIn conclusion, I believe students should join a club or an after school activity. It helps with many things the students may need in the future or strive for later in life. Kids who have the ability to join something that may change their life should join whatever might impact them and their future. Even if they might not see it, it helps them a long way into the future and opens up opportunities that might not be available to every child. Students should join activities and clubs whether they are required or not. It has so many benefits, I don't see why students shouldn't join. They can make friends, get noticed by colleges, find new hobbies, prepare for the future, and so much more. Overall, students can find success by just trying something they may have never before. Something that may seem like a simple activity or a \"\"hang-out\"\" can turn into something so much more.Â",

        "Have you ever been forced to do something that you did not want to do? Like a sport or some type of activity? Well the principal has decided that now on you have to be taking an extracurricular activity and I think that idea is terrible and disagree with his decision and here are my three main reasons. First what if the students parents can not help there kid with anything involving the activity. Secondly, the students may not have enough time for the activity. Thirdly, students may not like any of the activities.\nFirst lets talk about how parents can't get involved/or help with the activity at all. Like what if the activity fee is to much and the students parents can not afford it. Or there parents could be working later than usual and there not able to pick you up from the activity because there to busy with work. Also what if your parents are at home watching other siblings how are they gonna drop/pick you up. Or even what if they stayed home sick and there not feeling good who's going to pick them up or drop them off. And what if there exhausted from a big day of work and don't feel likeÂ getting up or moving because there to tired. Finally what if there injured and can't get out of bed then who's gonna pick or drop of the kids because they obviously can't.\nNext lets talk about students not having enough time for the activity because they have stuff to do. Like they have a lot of HW they have to do or catch up on. Or there going to another siblings activity because they can't stay home alone. Also they may have to stay home and watch younger siblings because they can't be left home alone without someone. Or even what if they planned with a couple of friends to hangout that day and go do something fun. And what if there parents have a lot of chores planned for them and there not able to finish because they have to go to the activity. Finally what if they do other activities outside of school like a sport or a club.\nFinally lets talk about how the students may not like any of the activities the school has and what it could cause. Like the students could get mad that there being forced to do something they do not wanna do. Or they could develop a bad relationship with there parents because they feel like there parents are forcing them to do it. Also they might get so bored they will just end up skipping the activity instead of going to it. Or even there behavior could change in a bad way making them mean, naughty, and disrespectful. And they could start developing depression because there being forced to do something they do not want to do which can build up depression/anger/sadness. Finally they could get really bored of the activity and keep misbehaving.\nThis is why forcing kids to do something they don't want to do/or can't do is bad. Because it can lead up to a lot of bad things in a students life and a very few good things. So I think these activities should be optional so you do not have to deal with your parents not being able to help you with anything involving the activity, or not having enough time to do the activity, and not having any activities you like. So if they were optional it would create not as much stress on the students and parents so not everyone is freaking out.",

        "Imagine having to stay after school for an activity you don't enjoy. Students spend seven long hours learning each day and the last thing they want to do is stay at school longer. Most students want to relax after a tiring day of learning. I don't think students should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity.\nStaying after school for a sport, club, or even student council will take away time with family, make expenses to maintain the school after hours rise, and give students less time to complete homework or attend other commitments.\nSpending time with family is important and much needed. If students are forced to stay after school then they're taking away valuable time to be with family. When students are done learning everyone should be able to go home to see their family. A lotÂ of people like to eat dinner together and it would be hard if your kid is having to stay after school for an activity. Adding extra time spent after school can mess up a families plans for the night which isn't fair.\nMaintaining the school for seven hours a day is hard enough. Adding at leastÂ an hour of the school operating each day increases the money spent onÂ heat, air conditioning, and electricity. Each day one hundred dollars is spent on just electricity for the building. Adding fifteen dollars to each day for electricity will add up. Heat and air conditioning is way more expensive than you think. The school spends around five hundred dollars each week towards keeping the school comfortable. Having extracurricular activities will require that amount to rise.\nMajority of students have something to do after school whether it's homework or other commitments. Teachers normally require homework to practice the skills students learn in class. If after school activities are required then homework will have less time to be completed. When there is a small time frame for assignments, students will get stressed and not do their best work. Most kids have a sport or music lesson they attend after school although, the after school activity may get in the way by making the kid late or tired.\nAlthough extracurricular activities may help students get involved with the school, there are many reasons why this is not a good idea. I think the principal should not follow through with this proposal because there could be a lotÂ of negative effects. Taking away time to be with family, more expenses for maintaining the school, and giving less time for homework and other commitments are just three of the many negatives. Forcing students to do something they don't want to after learning hours is not fair. Students and teachers need to spend the afternoon hours at home relaxing not at school.Â",

        "I believe that all students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they dont want to. They should be able to do what they want and not forced to do extra things, now if some students want to participate in some of the activities they can but others should not be forced to. Most students like there free time in school and not forced to do something to make them give up that free time, others may want to do the activities which is fine but others shouldÂ not be forced to do the activities, and students may not find any of the extracurricular activities fun or interesting so which they may not find fun in doing.\nFirst of all, students like there free time. Should they really give that up for something they dont want to do? If a student has free time in school they would like to enjoy it, not have to spend time doing something they did not want to do most all forced to do. Free time in school for students is like having a day off, they have time to chill and take a breather from work and many other things. If the students free time was taken away do to a extracurricular activate they would be really mad and frustrated students. Why would you want to take that away from the students, it is one of the only things enjoyable for them.\nSecond of all, some students may want to do that activate but others just dont want to. Now if some students would want to participate in the activities they may but forcing another to do it is not right. the students should have a choice if they want to or if they dont, if they want to they can if not its OK and they cant or should not be forced to. People dont like to be forced to do an extracurricular activities if they are doing just fine.\nFinally, what if the students do not find any of the activities fun or enjoyable? Do you really want to make some body do something they dont enjoy or find fun in at all? If they dont find fun in the activity they wont do it and may end up failing the extracurricularÂ activity they were forced to do. So if they cant find fun in it why should they have to do it. Many others may want to do something else that is fun and enjoyable and not forced.\nNow if that is not enough to change your mind on having to make them do an activity that they loose free time, that some may want to do but others dont, and finally may not find any fun or interest in, then i dont have any thing else for you then. You should not have to make anyone do anything if they dont want to. after all they are human beings they should be able to do what they want.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "I live in the middle of nowhere. Deep in the woods on a small gravel road in a town most people have never heard of. In fact I dont live in the same town as my school. A little bus picks me up at exactly 8:20 am and hustles down my pothole-filled road into the next town over, just in time for the bell. But not all kids live like I do. Many can walk to their school in 2 minuets tops. We both come to school for the same amount of time, and then go back to our homes. Now, who's to say that we both aren't busy? Homework, family, other hobbies and activities that take up the rest of daylight. Busy with something that won't always involve school. Now, the prinicple has decided that all students are required to participate in at least one extracirricular activity. Who has the time for that? Student's should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.\nOne of my favorite hobbies is singing. I take lessons every week, and I preform in little shows in the spring and fall. I have lessons on Tuesday and Thursday, from 6 to 7pm. I get home about 7:30, and then I go to sleep. I use the couple of hours before hand to finish homework and eat dinner. My day is busy from sunrise to sunset. Now, there are other kids whos days end at 10:30pm. Some play a sport, and those practices last hours . Others are in theater, and I know from experience that play practice NEVER ends. We simply have no time in the day for an extracurricular activity. But not everyone is fortunate enough to have after school hobbies and play sports.\nI live quite literally in the middle of nowhere. I can recall more times than not when my friends tell me that their parent's wont pick me up because of where I live. My mom travels a lot for her work, and my dad lives cities away. My brother's babysitter can barely get him into the car in time to drive me to singing lessons. His tantrums are a melody within itself. I am lucky that I am able to be driven to my lessons, but not everyone is given that luxury. Some teenagers are home alone until their parents get back late at night, others just aren't allowed to leave their house. One of my closest friends lives in the heart of her town, but her parents wont let her walk anywhere unless it is to or from school. Everyone's families are different. Not everyone has a stay-at-home mom to drive them places, or the gas money for it. Unless the school wants to send a bus or reimburse the families who have to pick their kids up from these required activities, we might just have to stay at home.\nSpeaking of home life, what about our families? I have two younger brothers, one with a disability. I have spent more weekends then i'd like to admit watching my brothers, and many evenings when the babysitter has to leave earlier than my mom get home. Other kids watch their siblings the minute they get home from school, becuase their parents can't afford or don't trust a babysitter. And not all of us get paid to do it. I sure don't. It's \"\"part of my responsibility as the oldest.\"\" It sucks. But I know my mom works hard, and family is more important than an after schoolÂ activity. I have friends who are the youngest, and do whatever they please. I know other people who cook dinner and clean the house for their parents and younger siblings. It's just how the cookie crumbles. Lots of kids just do not have the capabilities to participate in these extracirricular activites.\nWhat about the kids who play video games, or do nothing but sleep when they get home? Some of them walk home from school everyday, and do as they please. I can think of one person in seconds who lives a life like that. I call them up after schoolÂ and they're playing on their X box. I personally don't see the hype about video games, but then again, I prefer gardening and writing stories. Video gamesÂ and the internet in general are a topic of controversy and speculation everyday, and it plays a major role in the modern generation. But who's to say it's all bad? Besides, us kids go to school 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 180 days per school year. We need a break! Homework bleeds into home life, and many of us are quite busy in the after schoolÂ category. Kids who play video gamesÂ or simply sleep after schoolÂ need those little bursts of joy in their week. Some kids stay up late completing homework that is too overwhelming or difficult for them to finish quickly. We need more than 8 hours of sleep, and many teenagers get less than that everyday. The trend of 8 hours of sleep was actually created by a company in an advertisement, not by a study done by scientists. It was advertised to promote 9-5 jobs, and eventually became a lifestyle in the United States. We're still kids, and we still need as much sleep as infants. Our society hasn't seen the potential our generation has because we're constantly drained. Adding an extracurricular activity isn't going help.\nOverall, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. Some adults may not realize it but us teenagers have our own lives too! I like hanging out with friends and sleeping in on weekends, and that doesn't make me lazy. Us students are too busy, too tired, and too involved in our families for more activities. Some of us don't have the facilities for it either. There is simply not enough time. Which is ironic considering we live with a calendar that has 365 days.\nAt the end of the day, every kid does their best, and it puts a lot of stress on teenagers. 14, 15, and 16 year old kids are being given work most adults can't handle. We're treated like little kids, yet expected to behave and act like adults. Everyday asks a lot from us, and we try. We deserve time away from school. We deserve time for ourselves. So let us have it.",

Even though kids may have these issues, that doesn't mean they can't try. Anything can be healthy in it's own way, shape, and form! I think that you should make the kids at least have one after school activity but only to an extent.Â Â Â Â",

        "The sound of laughter fills the air as one girl talks about her experience as a midfielder. The other midfielders smile while the attack and defense laugh their hearts out. The lacrosse club is one of the many extracurricular activities at this school. Though you may be busy, extracurricular activities can help you make new friends, stay active, and makes you use your time wisely.\nEver have trouble connecting with people? When you join a after-school activity, your group all have that one thing in common, which is a great place to start. Like in the first paragraph; maybe it's lacrosse. You can connect further by joining the subgroups. In the lacrosse club, there are 3: defense, attack, and midfield. Or say you joined the book club; you could talk about books you've read. Kinda like lacrosse, book club also has subgroups: fiction and non-fiction. All in all, extracurricular activities will help you meet more people.\nStaying active physically and socially is good for your mental and physical health. When you talk to others, you improve your diplomacy skills, as well as your ability to hold a conversation. After all, who wants to be lonely for the rest of their life? Exercise, as I'm sure you know, does wonderful things to the body. Such as reducing fat, raising your cardiovascular endurance, and, in general, making you feel good. Have you ever gone for a, say, 1 or 2 mile walk and felt refreshed after? It feels nice doesn't it? So get out there and have fun!\nHowever, some people may say that they don't have enough time for extracurricular activities. They have soccer practice Monday, basketball on Wednesday, lacrosse practice on Friday, and a basketball game, as well as a lacrosse game on Saturday. While that is a busy schedule, that person is forgetting about Tuesday and Thursday. What if they wanted if off? Well, think about it. Does it seem like these after-school things take up much time? Not at all! In fact, most of them only take up an hour of your day. This will also help you manage your time so you can do as much as possible within that small period. This skill will also come in handy when you are older.\nAfter-school activities are a great way to meet new people, help you get out more, and use your time to it's fullest potential. You should take advantage of the amazing opportunity you have to be more, well, out there! So the real question is, why wouldn't you join an extracurricular activity?",

It's not always fun when you are required to participate in something you don't like.\nWell my principle thinks that all students must participate in some type of activity or sport during school. I have a few opinions on that. First of all there are different types of people. Not everyone likes to participate in sports or activities. Theres also people that aren't veryÂ social so, participating in anything might not be there thing. Then theres some that are just lazy. On the other side their are people that like to participate and be social with people. Theres actually interested in sports or school activities. But sometimes poeple just want to talk with their friends. I think it should't be required to participate in school activities. You should be able to choose what you want to do. Like if you don't participate you should just be able to hangout with your friends while, others can play sports or participate in activities. If some poeple choose to do sports or be in any sort of activity thats great for them.\nThese are my reasons why, I disagree if my principle required us to participate in any school activity.

        "Our beloved principal has decided that students attending this excellent school must be a member of a least one extracurricular activity, and I am in complete support of this idea. The benefits of this proposal are exquisite and will not only help students, but parents as well. Some students may think staying after school would be an annoyance, but there is something for everyone after the last bell. Whether students join a football team or a math club, many children will have a bright smiles on their faces when they're participating in an activity of their choice. All students should be required to participate in a minimum of one extracurricular activity because it will enhance the minds and muscles of students, teach students to be active citizens, and assist working parents.\nTo begin with, executing this decision will strengthen the minds of many students. Fun clubs like the Drama Club and Art Club promote out of the box thinking and creativity. A vast majority of students would benefit from these teachings because they work a part of a student's brain that isn't alwaysÂ challenged throughout the school day. Also, clubs are great way to introduce new career paths to children. For example, the Robotics Team introduces students to the growing world of STEM. Practicing STEM from a young age, especially in an after school club, is a spectacular way to increase the number of future engineers, mathematicians, and scientists, which would heavily benefit our technology advancing planet.\nIn addition to clubs, students would also have more opportunity to join sports teams. Some parents cannot afford to pay for a recreational or travel sports team, so this required extracurricular activity could help a number of less fortunate students participate in a sport of their choice. This requirement couldÂ also promote health benefits for students. With an extracurricular activity as requirement, some students who usually don't exercise may join a sports team, leading to an overall healthier school. Furthermore, with more students participating in school sports, there will most likely be more supporters at games. This could result in more school spirit and in total a more enthusiastic student body.\nAlso, requiring students to participate in after school activities could teach majority of our students to become good, active citizens. Good citizens participate in local government. This new requirement teaches students to participate in extracurricular activities, consequently many of them will form a positive habit of being active in their communities. Children form habits and learn many critical skills in their grade school years, so teaching them to start participating now could greatly impact the future of community activity. To elaborate, some students may join student council. Student council is superb preparation for future government jobs students might hold. Therefore, requiring students to become members of at least one extracurricular activity could lead to a better society with more active citizens.\nLastly, this decision could assist hard working parents. Most parents work 9:00am to 5:00pm, and if their children are at school for an additional hour for an extracurricular activity, they would have the luxury of being able to get all of their work done, and pick up their children from school on time. Mothers and fathers of many students work extremely hard to provide for their families. With an extra hour to spare on a day their children stay after school, parents could potentially have a more zen car ride, free from worry of being late to the car pick up line. As a result of having additional time to get to the school building, parents may drive slower. This could lead to safer roads with fewer accidents.\nTo conclude, the principal's decision to require students to participate in one extracurricular activity is beneficial to the student body and their parents. The decision helpful because it will introduce new ways of learning to many students, promote exercise and school spirit, teach students to participate in their communities, and help working mothers and fathers. This idea could also make the roads safer. As a student, member of many clubs, and a car rider, I believe this decision will make our school better for students, and make our school unique from others. Requiring students to participate in a minimum of one after school activity was a great decision made by our principal and should be supported by all of the amazing students that make out school special.",

        "Generic_Name\nGeneric_Name\nEnglish Honors 8\nMarch 11, 2020\nSchool PrincipalsÂ Should Not Require Extracurricular Activities\nTheir are many benefits to participating in after school activities, they can improve your knowledge on a variety of topics, introduce you to new experiences, provide a chance to strengthen your social skills, and most of all they can be enjoyable! They are not usually enjoyable however, when you have been forced into taking them, and especially not when everyone in your school has been forced to also. There are many reasons why students don't want to or even can't partake in these activities some of which being that it is a financial struggle for many families, it causes a stress for time, and can lead to disappointment.\nSome parents cannot afford to pay the fees required to enroll their children in extracurricular activities. Imposing a rule that these activities are mandatory would mean that they would have to spend the money that they need for other more important things in order to satisfy the principal's instructions. This would then deprive them of a comfortable home lifeÂ since they would be unable to purchase certain needs, and even farther from receivingÂ any desired luxuries. It may even endanger them because they are in an unsafe predicament that they can't afford to get out of.\nThe children's guardians might not have a flexible schedule that will allow them to take time to transport their child to and from their activities. Making them required would result in parents having to take time off of work or enlist others to either accomplish their home responsibilities or pick up their child from the school activity. The students would suffer from time deprivation as well. Time that the students should be spending on school work or family interaction would instead be put towards their activities. They would also not have any time to develop personal hobbies since they would be participating in arranged activities.\nBecause every student would be enrolling in school clubs at once there would be high competition and a large portion of the students would end up in activities that they don't want. This would leave them disappointedÂ about their assignment and disdainful of the principal's program. There is a possibility that it would even discourage them enough not to partake in similar activities in the future. Thus this requirement has more of a possibility of restricting the students strengths and cutting their future options further in life.\nThough there are some rewards that come with participating in extracurricular activities not everyone should have to. Each person has different factors to consider when choosing whether or not to join an after school club or sport. Furthermore, it should be up to the student and their family to decide if they can participate in these groups.",

        "These days, before deeming them worthy of an acceptance letter, colleges take many aspects of a students life, into consideration. Many think colleges only look at grades and test scores, when that is not the case.\nAlthough, grades and test scores are crucial to admission, they aren't the only thing colleges look at. Extracurricular activities are a great way to stand out to colleges. Many students shy away from participating in extracurricular activities because they aren't aware of the benefits. Requiring students to participate in them would eliminate future grievances.\nLeadership skills, passion, and being well-roundedÂ are all things colleges look for in students.\nColleges absolutely love having notable alumni; which is why, they look for pupils with many examples of leadership.\nSchools offer various opportunities to show off those skills.\nOne popular example is sports.\nWhat says leadership better than being team captain?\nSports are also a common way to receive scholarships.\nLast year, someone on the Riverside Baseball Team got into Princeton. It is very likely they got in because of their performance on the baseball team. He probably wouldn't have gotten into Princeton if he hadn't played baseball. The Riverside Baseball player is a key example of how extracurricular activitiesÂ are beneficial to students. If one isn't athletic, sports are not the only option.\nBeing the president, treasurer, or even secretary, of a club are wonderful positions to show leadership.\nMy older sister was the treasurer of Humanity First in her junior year and the president in her senior year; she was accepted into Duke.\nIt is highly likely that if she wasn't president, or treasurer, she wouldn't have been admitted. Leadership skills are vital for college acceptance, and requiring extracurricular activities would help students showcase them.\nPassionate people are sought out by colleges, and extracurricular activities are a great way to show passion. Passionate people are often very committed.\nColleges want active members of society in their schools, not people who sign up for activities to be able to say they were apart of them.\nColleges know when someone signs up for a club just because they think it'll look good for college. They want people to sign up for a club because they genuinelyÂ enjoy its purpose, and not because of what it'll look like on an application. Colleges want active club members; not club members who barely go to meetings. Participating in marching band for all four years shows commitment, passion, and loyalty. Colleges want those attributes, so they are assured their students won't leave them for another college, and if they decided their major, they will stick with it. Required extracurricular activities would help students find their passions, and they would no longer wander aimlessly in life. Extracurricular activities show colleges passion, and passion is rare among teenagers. Often, passionate people go on to do great things in the world, and colleges want to have notable alumni.\nContrary to popular belief, GPA and test scores aren't everything.\nSure, they are very helpful and important on transcripts, but there are other factors colleges look at as well.\nColleges like well-rounded people.\nThis could be linked to the fact that American colleges allow their students to change their majors. If a person is well-rounded, then it is more likely that if they change their major to something completely different, they will not fail.\nBeing an active member in extracurricular activities shows that the person is not just good at memorizing notes, but that they are also able to partake in deeper thinking. Colleges want people that can use all of their brain, and not just one side of it. If someone had a perfect SAT/ACT score, a 5.0 GPA, and no extracurricular activities, they would probably not be chosen over someone with an SAT score of 1539, a 4.35 GPA and multiple extracurricular activities.\nRequired extracurricular activities would stop the person with a perfect SAT/ACT score and a 5.0 GPA from losing their spot to someone academically inferior who had more extracurricular activities. In terms of roundness, colleges want circles, not triangles.\nRequired extracurricular activities would benefit everyone. Leadership skills, passion, and appearing well rounded would enhance anyone's chances of getting into college and receiving scholarships.\nScholarships mean spending less money on college, which helps those who are paying for college. In the end, the principle's decision to require extracurricular activity participation, was a good one.",

        "Imagine, if you will, a world full of students with smart minds and massive strength. It would be the start of something beautiful. I love this plan, the thought of having every kid doing either a sport or a club they like could really help them and the whole school a lot more than just the kids that do it now. I agree with the Principal because participating in extracurricular activities would help the students get to know their peers, it would give the school an extra source of income, and finally, make the students physically and mentally stronger.\nHaving kids do extracurricular activities would help them to get to know their peers. When kids do something with one another, they get the feeling of camaraderie and friendship that usually comes with being on any sort of team, It builds a tremendous amount of trust. Furthermore, when students come home, they might not have any way to reach their friends, the after-school activities would help them stay connected to their friends. Finally, when students do anything, and win, they are given a sense of accomplishment, a sense like they could do anything in the entire world.\nPutting all the kids into extracurricular activities would generate an alternative source of income for the School. We all know that our schools are sometimes overcrowded and underfunded if we helped out by just pitching in a small fee for every child to join an after-school team or club, it would help the school have some sort of spending money so that they could get new things. Just by giving the school that small fee, we could help the kids by creating new opportunities for them, like getting them free college tours, or giving them new laptops that would allow them to make researching easier to get into better schools. And lastly, those fees would help pay the teachers salary, they are overworked and underpaid enough as it is.\nGiving the students the opportunity to go into after-school activitiesÂ would make them stronger both physically and mentally. If students join a sports team like Football or Hockey, it would make them stronger because it builds muscle and gives them purpose. Furthermore, When you look into the science behind why after-school activities are so important you would see that they make kids do better in school and at home, their entire work ethic is changed for the better. When students are both physically and mentally fit, they no longer have that craving for freedom, because they have found it in their teams, they no longer make the terrible choices that lead to them doing drugs, alcohol, or breaking laws because their freedoms are there for them.\nWhen students are placed into extracurricularÂ activities, they have more trust in their peers, they generate a new source of income for the School, and it makes the students physically and mentally fit. when we give the next generation the tools of success, we are making the world better. The science cannot lie, when placed in these situations with their peers, they come out stronger together, like a family. So, the next time that a school has a mandatory extracurricular activity to graduate, do it. Give the kids the tools to express themselves and control their own destiny.Â",

        "Do you want more stress and pressure from your schoolwork and extracurricular activity? Do you want your time with your family and friends cut short? In today's world, students usually gets too much pressure from their extracurricular activities causing them to forget about their grades and schoolwork. Students shouldn't have to do an extracurricular activity in school because it adds more stress to their academic and social life and it cuts the time they can us to spend their time with their family and friends.\nIn addition to that, a reason why students shouldn't be pressured into doing an extracurricular activity is because it adds more stress into their academic and social life. For example, if a student joined a sport or a musical group, students that chose a sport would put their focus in practice since the championship games may be coming up. And students that chose a musical or art activity would also put their focus in their practice time to make sure to top first in their competitions. And all the students would put their focus into their practice time to hold up the school's pride. Meanwhile, their grades may be dropping because the students aren't focused on their grades since their extracurricular activity is keeping them focus on the game or competition. Making students' school work and extracurricular activity hard to balance.\nFurthermore, another reason why students' shouldn't have the need to take an extracurricular activity is because it could cut the time they spend with their family and friends short. For example, students that chose a musical or sport as an extracurricular activity would have to do practice after schoolÂ to focus on the game or competition, and sometimes practice can be held back late since the coaches orÂ teachers want to make sure that the students are focused to hold up the school's pride. And with that, the time the students spend with their friends and family would cut short because of the need to focus on his/her extracurricular activity.\nIn conclusion, making students do an extracurricular activity would add more stress and pressure on to the student making their schoolwork hard to balance, and it cuts time off the time they spend with their family and friends.

        "Imagine being in a club, the kids in it share the same interests as you. You feel at home in this club, and you can talk to your peers if you have any trouble. Making extracurricular activities, like clubs and sports, mandatory will give students opportunities to enjoy this feeling and much more. They will give kids new experiences, and help them with their social lives, I know that these are true because I joined a club once and experienced all of these things!\nWhen kids join activities, they gain new experiences that they had never had before. Firstly, they could discover hobbies, and find out that they really like something that they would have never thought to try before. There is a saying, \"\"You never know until you try\"\", and some kids need to hear this saying. They might never try to join a club unless it is mandatory, but when they do, they might find something that they really enjoy hiding in one of those activities. Also, if they already enjoy one an activity, as in sports, art, music, and others, then they can get more experience in that field. If a child really enjoys drawing, painting, and being creative, but they don't really seem to have time to practice that, they could join an art club and become better at what they enjoy. Additionally, making mandatory activities will get some kids to do something other than laze around at home. In my case, and many of my friends' as well, I have nothing to do outside of school and get bored really fast. Having a mandatory extracurricular activity will help me get outside the house and do more. For these reasons, students would get so many new, life changing experiences from mandatory extracurricular activities.\nStudents' social lives could change for the better because of this new rule. Children will make new friends during these activities. Joining clubs and teams will introduce kids to new peers, and they might even be potential friends. Moreover, making students join an activity will help them in the long run. A lot of clubs will require students to have good grades, volunteer, and more. This will be better for when children are applying for colleges and even jobs when they are older. Lastly, students will grow closer with their old friends. If students join clubs that their friends join, they can spend more time with them than they usually do. I only have half of a block with one of my closest friends, and none with the other. Joining a club together will give us much more time to talk and make awesome memories. In conclusion, making students join clubs and teams will improve their social lives.\nIn my old school, I joined the Lego club with my little sister, I didn't know many people and neither did she. My knowledge of Lego was also not very vast, but none of the other clubs had seemed appealing to me and I also owned some Lego bricksÂ at home. Prior to joining the club, my biggest, most impressive build was a multicolored box that somehow housed a small Lego girl. My sister was not anywhere as experienced than I was. In fact, she only joined because I had, and she wanted to do everything that her big sister did. The first thing we had to do in that club was to make a team and make a space themed build, and our sibling duo decided to partner up with another pair girls. We had 45 minutes, the leftover time would be for displaying the builds. When the time started, our little band of four barely talked, except for the occasional joke or two, but as time went on, we had started to open up more, and soon we couldn't build due to the amount of laughter coming out of our mouths. By the end, we had made an ugly, big, white box that a little, astronaut figurine had squished inside. A masterpiece. We couldn't even present our build due to the fits of giggles that had overcome us, but it was worth it, and my sister and I became good friends with the girls. As time went on, we got better and better at building, and I fostered a new hobby; building with Lego. As you can see, joining an extracurricular activity benefited both my sister and I, and making these activities mandatory will touch many more students.\nAlthough some students will complain against this new rule, extracurricular activities will benefit them in ways that they do not see. Their lives will be filled with interesting new memories as they get more comfortable in their club, or sport. Many more students will have a better social life, making new friends, gaining better chances at colleges and jobs, and improving their old relationships. My time at the Lego club proved these things to be true, and I believe that making mandatory extracurricular activities will help so many students. More schools should make activities mandatory, not just ours.",

        "How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.\nThe first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there.\nAlso, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects.\nSecondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a painÂ to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for.\nFinally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.\nForcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.Â Â Â Â",

        "Making students participate in a extracirricular activity would be a good idea. Extracirricluar activities can help students gain more experience of physical strength, social activity and interaction, and new learning experiences. For example; A student who plays football outside of school can strengthen their physical and social health by playing with other team mates and working out at the same time, while maintaing new knowledge about the sport which would include new learning experiences too.\nParticipating in other activites outside of school can help a student figure out their true interests and help them discover carrers for the future. Making students try and learn something new can be beneficial if they are having trouble finding what peaks their interest. However, there may be some downfalls to this new idea. Extracirricular activites may sometimes not be so easy to manage. Especially with sports or activites for the school. Some activites can make students weeks feel stressful and overwhelming at times. Sometimes actvities can mess with the students outside life such as; traveling, family, religious purposes, etc.\nActivites that are easily able to maintain with the persons schedule and peaks the students interest should be acceptable to participate in. New opportunities could come up for the student reguarding to college or even future jobs. If a student decides to choose this activity in the future, companies would see that they have extra experience and might increase their chance of giving or accepting job offers to that particular student. If he/she works hard in school and maintains a healthy schedule that would not affect them severly, the student might get a scholarship from many different colleges and major in that specific category.\nHe/she might even make new friends in their new activity and might increase their chance of wanting to continue doing the program with them. Making new friends is also beneficial and could help increase the persons chance of wanting to continue participating in this new sport or activity.\nOverall, making students participate in extracirricular activites outside of school or for the school would be great to improve the students physical, social, and emotional health, help the sudent gain more knowledge about the acitvity, and decide future carrers and interests.",

Kids would make new friends, wouldnt be bored all the time and it would be healthier for them.\nHaving an extracurricular activity would be healthier for students. Sitting at home all the time is not healthy for anybody, many people can become depressed, lonely or just really bored. Getting out of the house more, you can get more exercise. Its healthier to be around people then to be alone all the time at home.\nThis is also a really good way to make new friends. Alot of people have friends that they hang out with all the time, this would be a good way to have more friends. Meeting someone at an after school event can mean that you share similar interests. That being said you would get along more because you can tak about you similar hobby.\nAlot of kids go home and become bored because tey have nothing to do. Finding something to do can also be difficult. Having an extracurricular activity would give you something to do after school. Some kids get into trouble when they have nothing else to do, but if they had something to do after school hey should be fine.\nAlthough some people would not agree with me, if you can be healthier, make new friends, and avoid being bored, having an extracurricular activity wouldnt be such a bad idea.

        "I agree that students should participate in extracurricular activities because, sometimes kids go home and have nothing to do and just sit around the rest of the day after coming home from school. Secondly, there is a vast number of students that dont participate in any activities at all. Doing sports and other activities could probably help some students a lot. You can hang out with friends while doing these activities which can make the activity more fun. Lastly, Everyone is always mostly on there phone so they dont do anything productive.\nMost of the time when kids get home they just lay around the rest of the day. Which is very boring, and not fun at all. Doing an extracurricular activity can stop you from being bored the rest of the day. When some students are bored they eat junk food, which is not healthy at all. Thats why some parents shouldn'tÂ let there child sit around all day. This happens very often where kids gain a lot of weight just from being bored. This can lead to a lot of health problems and i dont think anyone wants that for there kid. Nobody would want to see their kid really sick\nWhen doing these activities you can ask a friend to join you if they are not in any activities either. Asking a friend to join can probably make you enjoy the activity more. Maybe you might think the activity is boring and would be better enjoyed if a friend joined you so you can have someone to talk to. Having no oneÂ to talk to makes it boring and makes you want to quit. You can also meet new people and make new friends with the people that are also in these activities. So inviting a friend who isn't in any activities could probably help them too.\nEveryone is always on their phone and they really care about these activities. Sometimes students are more worried about playing a game on there phone or TVs when they get home. Thats these are even relevant for them. Additionally, They should talk about it more often in schools so the kids will see just staying home and doi9ng nothing isn't healthy and they at least should do sports or something productive. And being in front of a screen all day can damage your eyes. I don't blame them because being on your phone is basically like an addiction. Since there is so much to do on your phone instaed of actually going outside and doing things.\nIn conclusion, Being in a extracurricular activity could probably help improve your grades, your social skills, and your performance in school overall. It may even help improve some people grades, because a lot of people werent really focused on this type of stuff but joining an activity may help. It can help with boredom if students have nothing to do at home. It can also give them some fresh air if students are doing sports because they are technically cramped in a classroom and get stuck in busy hallways the whole day. So i agree that joining a extracurricular activity would be a good impact on school life.Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "Shoot the ball! Quickly! Swish that was the sound of my team winning the playoffs. Our principal decided that every student should attend at least on extracurricular activity. His decision has impacted us in a positive way. It's safe to say that I agree with his decision. An extracurricular activity can improve one's life emotionally, and physically.\nOne gain in attending an extracurricular activity is that it can fix a persons body weight. For instance, being in a sports team or cheer leadingÂ requires a healthy diet and working out. If you don't complete these two tasks it could have you kicked from the team. This emphasizes the fact that an extracurricular activity such as sports can improve one's health. Who doesn't want to be healthy? Being in the basketball team overweight is a tough job. Especially when the students in the team must go to practice almost everyday. When they go to practice, they improve their skills in basketball and their stamina meaning they have to run a lot, it can be for any sport. Since the person is already doing their workout in practice, all they have to do outside is eat healthy. Now thats easy! Within months this person could have lose tons of weight and maybe even started to get abs. Sports, an extracurricular activity, has already knocked down the health factor in ones life.\nSocial life is another factor in which an extracurricular activity touches upon. It can help someone make new friends that take interest in the same things as themself. One can join the art or the yearbook editing club and meet people that enjoy drawing, and painting as much as them. That student could potentially have found a new friend that they can share their stories or ideas with. This shows that just one extracurricular activity could bring a student one step closer to their peers. This works the same with any sport as well. Sports also have the ability to make a student connect with others. Moreover, it can help a person communicate better with the friends they already have. If one is having difficulty coming up with ideas to talk about with their friends, they can join a club or do sports. This will give each of them something to talk and discuss about. They could talk about how practice was or what they drew in the art club today. These extracurricular activities provide some people with something to talk about with their friends.\nAn extracurricular activity can help with teamwork, being open to other people's ideas, and sharing a student's own ideas. It can improve the way students consider other ideas coming from different people. If a student decides to serve the student council they have to think about all the others that are also a part of their team. These students have to keep in mind that students around the school might give suggestions on what one should improve. This means that an activity such as, this one can improve the way a student might think about an idea a different student could have suggested. Since, these students are in the student council they have to find a way to come up with a decision that implements everyone's ideas. If a student is working on the yearbook they must find a way to add every person's art in it. Even if it means changing it up a little. Teamwork is a big part of joining an extracurricular activity. Though one may not like a person who is the same club, one still has to consider their thoughts as well. Furthermore, a student might not have the confidence to share their own ideas until they join a club or extra activity. When this person see's that people in the student council are being open about their ideas, he/she might start to share. Hiding ideas inside of one may not show their full potential. Extracurricular activities help get rid of that fear a students might have.\nExtracurricular activities can make one more confident in their own ability. It not only enhances a student's social skills but also creates a path to a better school life. I believe that the principal's decision wasÂ impactful because of all the benefits one can get. Teamwork, health, and social life are not the only enhancements that extracurricular activities provide a student and the whole school with. Lets go collect our trophy guys!!!",

        "Some peopleÂ may think that forcing kids into doing extra circulars, could help them in the future but what if these kids have other reasons that they cant participate in these actives? If my principal tried to force students into doing extra circulars, I would disagreeÂ because, there is a large amount of families who will not be able to pay, Students could already have other commitments out of school and making students participate could end up hurting their grades.\nFirst off, In most countries and the United States Poverty rates are very high, meaning more and more families could struggle to let alone put food on the table, then making their kids do a sport that could cost hundreds of dollars may not be possible for lots of families. Sports teams like basket ball or soccer, usually have away games. That could mean having to stay over night, which is also very expensive leaving the families already very pressed on money, to not be able to go or have to rely on other for somewhere to sleep and eat. Even if the Students of these families are thinking of doing the play or debate team, there is usually still some sort of fee to join, or get the shirts and go to events, still leaving families to not have the money needed to participate.\nAnother reason forcing students to do an school activity is what they are committed to out of school. Students may have to babysit there younger sibling after school, so making the student stay after school one to five times a week. Would force the family to find another way to get the younger sibling taken careÂ of. Sports out of school, most school dont have every sport a student wants to play, forcing the students to join somewhere else. these practices could take up most of their time, so making the students to another activity could end up leaving them no free time, or even having to quit their original sport.\nLastly, if the students actually want to do the sport or activity. There are usually tons of practices leading them to have not much free time in betweenÂ school and practice. If the student starts to slip on school work and not turn in missing assignments, their grades could and will drop very low. Some kids know how to balance out work and sports, but not all do, so forcing all kids to take away an large amount of time from where they do their homework, Could also end up hurting not just the kids but the schools grade average may go down to.\nIn conclusion, Forcing kids into doing an Extra circular activity, could end poorly due to, families not have the finances to pay, Students having other commitments out of school and the possibility of students grades being effected poorly by the amount of work need in sports and clubs. If my principle was making a rule forcing every student to participate in an extra circular activity, I would have to disagree with their choices and thoes are my reasons why.",

        "Did you know that the majority of students currently or have participated in extracurricular activities? This is because there are many different forms of extracurricular activities that suit every student's needs or wants. I believe that schools should require every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they, build friendshipsÂ outside of school, take the students' mind off the stresses of school and strengthen the body and mind.\nExtracurricular activities build close bonds outside of school in many ways. They require students to get to know each other better than if they met at school, such as if they have different classes or friend groups. They Strengthen bonds that have already been formed, like those between two students that share a class. They allow for in inclusion of every student who participates in these activities.\nExtracurricular activites are a very good way to relieve stress from school. Such as, if a student has had a bad day at school they can particiapate in their activity and release some of that stress. They also require students to think about things other than school. If a student is having issues with a certain subject in school, they can go to a team practice and stop thinking about that subject for a while. School based extracurricular activities also help form bonds between students and teachers, leading to a higher chance of a student asking for help in class.\nFinally, extracurricular activities also help stregthen the body and mind. Students may participate in a book club or the debate team which help build confidence and intelligence therefore increasing school capabilities. However, sports like football or basketball help build physical strength and endurance. Participating in multiple extracurricular activities such as football and the cybersecurity team would be a perfect combination for building strength and intelligence.\nThe requirement of extracurricular activities is a very beneficial thing interms of building friendships, relieving stress and building physical and mental strength. All of these together create a very good reason why the principle should require every student to participate in at least one or more extracurricular activites. Should this rule be set in place the school shoud expect to see a boost in moral, grades and physical capabilities.Â",

After a while of being in a extracurricular activity you get very stressed. Extracurricular activities are sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. The principal at Generic_School has decided that all students must participate in a activity, but not everyone agrees with his decision. I disagree that all students must participate in a extracurricular activity because not all students have the time to be in a extracurricular activity, and students have less time in their regular classes.\nTo being with, I disagree that all students must participate in a activity because not all students have the time to be in a activity. A extracurricular activity is useless for some of the students. According to teachers students get stress having to deal with an activity at school. Students worry about the activities and could get distracted. More projects or work having to deal with. Also most students are not very interested in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Students could also stress parents with projects and more work from the activities that they have to deal with. For example, my friend Generic_Name gets stressed with the work he already has in class and a extracurricular activity would not be very helpful for him.\nFurthermore, students would have less time in their regular helpful classes. Having less time in their regular classes makes teachers also stress. Teachers have less time in class to teach students what they need to learn. Students learn less and goof more around in the activities. The grades of students could decreaseÂ badly because they are not learning enough. Also not all students are caught up in class and they would have less time in class to finish their makeup work. For example, some students do not show up to school and they would not have much time to catch up with the work that other students have finished in class.\nAdditionally, I disagree that all students at Generric_School should be required to be in a extracurricular activity.

So my friend Generic_Name decided to convince his principle to take the extracurricular activities away. The reason was becauseÂ the activities made students stress to much.

When someone takes away time from the time period the students need they feel like they have to carry the weight of the world by themselves and then they break under the pressure. Some students have preplanned activities with their families who they now can't spend time with. The extra work puts too much pressure on the students.

With bad attitudesÂ the school will have to give out more detentions then ever before.\nWith more students becoming exhausted students will not pay attention which could become a serious problem students could miss important announcements.\nThird, a problem caused by exhaustion can be bad grades.

The reason why students should participate in an after school activity is sports, students council, and the yearbook.\nThe first reason why students should participate in an after is sports. Sports is a great way for the school to be recognized by colleges. Scouts from colleges will want to come to our games to draft kids into their college.

        "\"\"My biggest in life is to help kids believe that they can be anything when they grow up.\"\"-Kobe Bryant. School is not only for learning but also for helping students practice valuable life skills. As most students think that school is just about learning, it is also teaching them important skills that they need to know later in life. Therefore, having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a good idea because it helps students work on important skills such as collaboration, creativity, and hard working.\nCollaboration I think is the most important skill to have to know on this list. Not only will you have toÂ know how to talk properly at work, you will also need to know how to talk properly anywhere you go. That is why the more you talk to people in a group the more you help your collaboration skills. Collaboration doesn't always have to be oral. It can be done when texting someone. Make sure you think before you speak also that is on where everyone has trouble on, even adults.\nCreativity can be good be bad. It can be good if your on a sports team and your need to make an exciting play. Creativity can also be found in artwork. Only the most beautiful artwork is fond from a creativeÂ artists. Now the reason creativity can be bad is if you take the lazy way out. By that I mean, say John's mom tells him to take out the trash but he don't feel like doing it, he then realizes that the trash can was left open. He decide to shoot the trash like it's a basketball in the trash. John then misses and he is left with a pile of trash to clean up. That is how creativity can be bad.\nA hard working person is a person who he/she puts effort into something to get it done. The more someone says they can't, the more they're telling their brain to just give up. But the more they tell themselves they can then they can do it. Just think of Jason Pierre Paul. He plays for the PhiladelphiaÂ Eagles. When he lost his arm as a young boy he though heÂ would never be able to play in the NFL with his brother. But he didn't quit and he showed the world how much effort he put into wanting to play in the NFL. He went on to win best defenses man of the year award. All because of his hard work.\nIn conclusion having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a great way to help students practice their collaboration skills, creativity skills, and hardworking skills. Every body needs to start learning these skills at a young age. So they can grow up to be a civilized human being. All we need is some modern civilized people. If we had them this world would be a better place to live in.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â",

        "You may think students should have to do an activity, but should they really be forced to? Students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity be fore, after, or during school. Being forced into something makes kids want to do it less, and doesn't give them the freedom and choice they deserve to have. Extracurricular activities take time and some students may be busy with things like homework or, at this age, working for a little bit of spending money. They also take away from time that could be spent with their families and unwinding after their school day has ended.\nFirstly, in middle school, kids are around the ages of 11-15, and they should be considered old enough to make their own decisions. Forcing somebody to do something is never considered a fun thing, or something you'd want yourself. This can lead to more misbehaving, and purposefully missing these activities. Giving the students the choice of doing an extracurricular activity would stop them from misbehaving or coming up with excuses to get out of something they may not want to do. And, let's face it, teenagers are at the stage where they would rather misbehave than listen to authorities, so it would be better to let them have their own choice in the matter.\nSecond, students may already be doing something after school everyday, meaning they don't have the time to do it in the afternoon. Some kids may have a lot of homework assigned to them by their teachers. Some students may already be doing a sport or activity after school that isn't for the school, maybe for the county or the town. Many students are given a lot of homework in middle school,or have plans after school. Which brings me to my next point.\nExtracurricular activities take precious time away from students. This time could be better spent making stronger bonds with their family members, or hanging out with brothers or sisters. While some people may not have siblings, this point still stands. A lot of kids' families are busy, and the one day they aren't they may have a sport or an after school group meeting. Some kids may have family visiting that they only get to see a few times a year, and it would be better for them to spend time with their loved ones instead of running around and kicking or throwing a ball or sitting and talking about school issues.\nIn conclusion, students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities or sports after school without their consent. They miss time that could be spent with their families, or time that could be used on their in school work or spent on activities they may have that aren't from the school. They also should have the choice to do what they would like to, as they are in middle school and are not just little kids anymore. While you may think this was a good idea, the students and I disagree, and would like our choices back. It would be best for the school's reputation amongst parents and their kids and it would be best for the students themselves to not have to participare in an extracurricular activity.",

        "I highly disagree with the Principal's decision that students have to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity. I believe that students should be able to choose whether or not do a after schoolÂ activity. Most of the time kids are exhausted from a long day of school, and want to rest once they get home ,they can't do that if they have an after school activity they have to go to. Often times people have to go home and take care of there younger sibling or other family obligations that are way more important then an after school activity. Some students already have mandatory sport practices and if they do have an after school activity right before it they are just going to waste their energy on that and will be tired for practice. Some work part time jobs after school to help support their family. There are so many more important obligations and they should notÂ have to stay after.\nExtracurricular activities are extra for a reason. Extraculicalar activities aren't part of the school day so we should not be forced to stay after. There are students that just dont like after schoolÂ activities. There is never going to be an activity available that interests everyone. When children's options are taken away such as having to stay for a extracurricular activity they like it less. They like having the option to stay after or to not stay after. Once it becomes mandatory and not a option to stay after it just feel like a chore that has to be done, but you dont want to do. Some students are simply not comfortable with after school activities because, they dread the thought of social interaction, and might be shy. They already have to deal with being scared of social interaction at school but then after school and it just makes them even more stressed and anxious. Kids like to take a break and have fun with their friends after schoolÂ and much rather do that.\nThe students will have less time to do their homework. When students stay after they have less time to do their homework or school projects. Students often stay up all night just to get there projects done or even study. School work is way more important than extracurricular activities. When a student has to do so many things at once they get very stressed and worn out. A kid might have to stay after then right after have practice for a sport then after have to work on a project till late. When students Sleep late they have even less energy at school the next day and often wont even be able to pay attention without falling asleep. If students have a test the next day they wont be awake enough to even remember the right answers.\nIn conclusion I do not agree\nI think that there is no reason for the principal to make everyone do an extracurricular activity extracucilar activities should be a choice. most have sports,jobs,family obligations,,just dont wanna go or have school work that needs to be done. After school being mandatory takes freedom away and as a child you already dont have much freedom so you should be able to choose whether or not you stay after. If a student likes after schoolÂ then they will stay after school ,but if a student doesnt stay after they obviously dont due to not wanting to or having obligations. Students are stressed enough with school work and projects to be having to do a after school activity. The students will not enjoy it if it is mandatory because children like having freedom. I disagree with the principals decision.",

        "Have you ever wanted to be in a club but were afraid of meeting people? Did you ever think about expanding your mind in trying something different or challenging? Or, maybe, you just wanted to join ceramics or drama? Many of us, especially teens, worry about talking to new peers of ours. so we never try it. If we never attempt to go the extra mile to do something, we might miss out on the chance of meeting a life long confidant. After-school activities guide us into doing things out of our comfort zones to enjoy many unknown hobbies. These special groups provide such enjoyment and laughter to thousands of children. I agree with the decision that all students may participate in at least one extracurricular because it takes away unnecessary stress, gives new topics to learn about, and students can make new friends.\nFirst, learners should take at least one extracurricular because it removes unneeded stress. For example, it creates an enjoyable part of school at the end of the day. As every teacher knows, students don't favor school very much and adding an exciting aspect to it will let them relieve all that built up information about tests and homework. Also, this provides a way of releasing all stress by having a specific time that contributes to doing so. When kids don't go straight home and start their homework, they feel more at ease and relaxed about their schoolwork and don't feel pressured. Furthermore, clubs let young thinkers forget about the crazy nonsense that might've occurred at school that day. Maybe students got sent to the office and are worked up about that, this assists them by going somewhere where no one judges you and keeps you as calm as possible. Therefore, removing stress is a big factor on why learners should participate in an extracurricular.\nSecond, these activities give new topics to learn about. For instance, many young adults might be unsure about their interests, and they could make it clear for themselves. You might believe you hate art, but when you join the school club for it, it could be your dream profession to become an artist. Everyone will be able to discover their passions at their own pace. Additionally, if a person wants to be apart of a cultural learning group, it will grow their mind to understand different races and nationalities to compare to their own. While attempting to understand a unknown area, children enrich their knowledge of the world. Moreover, teens can have an opportunity to talk and address issues that are not taught in the classroom. They might touch on World War II in History, but if they want to go into it more in depth, World War II Club will provide them with that. In summary, extracurricular gives brand new items to go deeper into, which helps in the many ways listed above.\nLastly, people can make new friends. Many professors and parents believe that pushing our kids to meet new peers is wrong and shouldn't be accepted. They say that they should gradually build up the courage to speak up. But why not head startÂ them into the path of publicly speaking to people they don't know. Many children haven't been taught how to be confident, so I believe adding these activities will add that to the curriculum. When put in these groups, students are exposed to others with unique backgrounds. They all can share their own point of views to start up collaboration, which can lead to becoming best friends forever. Another point is the freedom of seeing people outside of your classes is added. When you have a pattern of saying hi to a variety of colleagues, you make more connections that could possibly last a lifetime. Introverts also have the chance of conversing very often. They are sometimes misunderstood and handing them a way of being understood might let them open up a bit. All in all, knowing new faces and personalities could create a way of adding friends.\nIn conclusion, I agree with the decision that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it removes stress, it promotes the making of new friends, and gives a variety of topics to learn about. Every teenager should go out and try something they haven't. They should understand that this new rule actually benefits them in ways that they never even noticed. You need to take risks to have new experiences in your life to look back on. \"\"New and \"\"different\"\" might be scary words to hear, but sometimes change and interaction is fascinating. Just take that leap of faith, and everything will work out in the end. When you join that ceramics club, all your fears of people and challenge will go away. Your mind will expand, and it could turn out to be your passion.",

        "Must all students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity? Some schools make their students participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity whether the students want to or not, the students don't really have a say. I disagree, students shouldn't have to participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity. The principle might just want to help the students so that they can get into a good college or just into a good school in general. There are many reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity. Some reasons as to why students shouldn't be made to take an extracurricular activity is simply because they might not have time, their parents may not want them to, and they might just not be interested in extracurricular activities at the moment.\nHaving to take an extracurricular activity is a big responsibility in a way. Students might not have time because just like anybody else they also have a life outside of school and they have things that they need to do everyday. They might need to watch their siblings while their parents are at work, also they have homework for almost every class and apart from that they still have to do chores around the house. The students might really wantÂ to do a sport or join a club or maybe even do both but they might not be able to. The reason being is because they would then have to go after school so that they can go to practice for a sport or meet up with the other people from the club. There's a specific time you have to be there and if you can't make it you might get kicked out of the club or sport or any other extracurricular activities.\nNot having enough time might not be an issue but maybe their parents just dont want them to participate in anything. There are many reasons as to why this can happen, the student might get hurt really easily if its a sport or maybe even by doing simple everyday things, their parents might not be able to take them back to school when school is over because they might not have transportation, the parents could even possibly think that its dumb. There are many more reasons as to why their parents might just not want them to join a club or a sport or even just an after school class. The parents have their reasons because it's their child and they want to do what's best.\nLastly the student might just not want to do anything at the moment. They get a lot to do in school and they still get homework,Â then when they get home they might just want to relax. They might be thinking about doing sports or something else this upcoming year but just notÂ now. students get really stressed with all the work that they get that they might just notÂ want to add more stress by having one more thing to worry about. maybe they are military and they might have to moveÂ to a whole different place where they don'tÂ know anyone so they want to take a year off to get to know some people before they start joining anything.\nStudents shouldn't be made to take an extra curricular activity because they simply might not have time, their parents might just not want them to, or they might just not want to take any extracurricular activities at the moment. They should be able to have a choice of whether they want to take an extracurricular course or not. Students shouldn't have to do more than they have to if they really just don't want to orÂ if they can't.

        "Extracurricular activities can be the thing that a student looks forward to doing that day, counting down the hours and minutes until school ends. They are a great place to interact with others and develop an interest or skill,Â where lasting friendships can be made outside of a student's normal social circles.Â The students have a greater control over how things are run, providing kids the chance to step into leadership roles. However, they are not for everyone. Students should not be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because the school could not cover the wide range of interests students have, would waste time that students need, and would ruin the experiences of other people participating in the activity.\nStudents have a wide variety of interests and hobbies, some that cannot be pursued through an elective or a school-sponsored extracurricular. The point of extracurricularÂ activities, after all, is to develop skills farther than what students learn in school. While some people with interests like football and journalism can join school-sponsored extracurricularÂ activities like the football team or the school newspaper, other students enjoy more niche or specific subjects. Incorporating these subjects into school extracurricularÂ clubs would be difficult due to high equipment costs, lack of space, lack of widespread interest, or several other reasons. For example, some students consider fencing to be their favorite activity. However, the equipment required to do fencing is expensive and prone to breaking. This may not be extremely hard for one person to afford, but starting a school fencing club would require the school to buy several sets. Furthermore, fencing also requires a 14 meter strip as well as extra room so other students will not get hit by any stray blades. The school's resources are limited, and could not sponsor an activity like this without the kind of support that only mainstream sports have. In the meantime, it is not fair to the students who fence to force them into another activity when they could be practicing fencing outside of school.\nExtracurricular activities take up time that would be better spent elsewhere. School already takes up a large chunk of the day, but by requiring students to do extracurricular activities, kids are forced to stay for one or two more hours doing activities that do not seem worth spending time on. If a student chooses to join an extracurricular because they wanted to and not because it was required, the activity wouldn't seem like a waste of time. For the other students, however, those few hours could be spent on homework, catching up on sleep, connecting with friends and family, or pursuing their interests outside of school. Many students are on sports travel teams, and they need the time to practice with their team. Some people take classes outside of school or just prefer to do activities they like at home. Although these students are not joining school clubs, they are still doing extracurricular activities and should be able to continue doing so without worrying about running out of time for homework or missing out on sleep.\nForcing people to participate in an extracurricular activity would ruin the experiences of other students. Making extracurricular activities a requirement would cause people to join clubs without genuine interest in the activity. These students will show less enthusiasm and put in less effort towards club activities and can drag things down for other students. They could be unwilling to do work or serve as a distraction to other students. There is a similar situation in elective courses, where some students only select a course because they believe it will be an easy class. Those students tend to participate less or be loud and off-topic. During group projects, they don't contribute as much. For many other students, it is frustrating to deal with these people, especially since there is no common interest in the activity they are doing.\nRequiring participation in extracurricular activities ultimately does more harm than good to students because it disregards that broad range of activities students enjoy and takes valuable time from students who should be free to choose how to spend it. It also detracts from the value of extracurricular activities- which are created by people cooperating and acting on a common interest -by adding people who don't enjoy the activity. Inspiring students to be curious and passionate should be the school's priority, but by requiring students to do an extracurricular club the schools are only boxing students into a mold that ignores the complexity and individuality of each person. Students are required to get an education that will help them survive as adults, but they should be able to decide which hobbies and skills they want to specialize in. In the end, the unique path they decide to carve out for themselves should be of their own making.",

        'Almost 50% of students in our school sign up for extracurricular activities. That is half of our school! But, there is another half to our school who do not participate in extracurricular activities. They all have their own reasons to not take part in these activities and should not be penalized for a reason which they might not be able to avoid. Therefore, I disagree with our principles decision to make it mandatory for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students need that extra time to dedicate it towards their family and other activities that they go to which they prefer over the ones in school, they might feel various negative effects due to these activities, and they also might dislike the options that they are provided with in school.\nStudents need this extra time to use it for their families and other recreational things they do after school.. They might have to hurry to their homes because they have to pick up their siblings. I know many who go home quickly without any hesitation because they have to pick up his or her young sister or brother who can\'t walk home from where his or her school bus stops by themselves. Many students live far away and do not get a school bus and could get tired after an after schoolÂ activity, making them unable to walk to their homes. Now, unless they can take the bus to near their homes or have a parent or guardian pick them up, this will be very problematic for them, especially for the people who decide to take part in a sports activity. People also sign up for other things that amuse them after school. For example, a student might have been part of a soccer team which they played for and trained with after school. This necessity of having to go to an after school activity becomes a huge roadblock if they want to really succeed as a soccer player or any sport in general. All in all, over usage of time by our school seems to be a big problem caused by these activities.\nSchools are funded based off of how their students perform and these after school activities play a role in grade drops. Learners are often stressed out in school already because heavy loads of homework or assignments in school and extracurricular activities will more likely stress them out furthermore. The likelihood of an after school activity which isn\'t fun and requires you to study in a boring way, is high. Our school even makes us do homework for 3/4 of Gaming club where we are supposed to be having fun and gaming with our friends. Which also leads me to the point that some activities are misleading. Students get upset when they realize that they signed up to do homework for almost the entire time in Gaming club. Once students get a firm grasp of the idea that the activities that they are doing are not serving their purpose, they will lose interest in those activities and maybe even school. Loss of interest in school is already caused by the core subjects. And placing down more things for students to learn makes them more viable to give up on school. Basically, schools would be seen as manipulating and stressing their students out to what they think ""benefits"" them.\nTeachers and the school, and of course mainly our principle, may think that putting down a rule to have to be ""using your time for learning and having fun"" makes us more productive. But in reality, it very much does not. The country with the best education system does not force work onto students by putting down homework on their backs. They instead, educate them in a fun and memorable way. Students will remember the time that they all hopped in a Minecraft server to learn math, and will most likely forget the time that they had to do five pages of math homework for two hours straight just to get a C on that homework. The manipulative part about these activities do not help the school in any way. Deceptive ways to get your students to work will backfire. So, schools should just approach this situation with more concern for the students.\nAll schools are not like this, so why should we be. Tricking our students to ""learn"", using up their time to force them to, once again, ""learn"" and stressing them our with these activities to make them ""learn"" should not be the way to go. School should invest more time listening to the voices of the students that they teach and adapt to modern times. Everything changes to fit the standards of modern society. Why should our school not do the same?',

        "How would you feel if your school district made you participate in an extracurricular activity? You may feel angry, or you may be exited. Some some students love being involved in fun activities like a sports team, or art club. Others have a good reason why they don't enjoy that experience. I believe that it's not fair to force students to participate in extracurricular activities because serious events at home may be taking up their time, they may have learning disabilities, and because it's another opportunity for bullying to occur.\nImagine that your mom is in the hospital, or your sister has anxiety and depression, and you want to spend time with them. Then your school district decides that everyone has to be involved in an after school program, and now you cant spend as much time with your loved one as a result of the time commitment. This is why I think it's important to let the students decide weather they want to do an extra activity or not. What if someone you where close with recently passed away, and you dont feel like doing extra activities? Than you wouldn't show up, and be marked absent. This is why I believe that we should not make students participate in after school activities.\nHave you ever had a to finish work from school at home? This is unfortunately common for students with learning disabilities. If students with who spent a lotÂ of time doing school work where involved with an after school activity, they may have no choice but to stay up late in the night doing homework. I myself have a mild learning disability, and its not uncommon for me to come home from school with unfinished school work that I have to finish by next class. It truly is unfair for the school district to force students to do extra activities which are supposed to be optional, and I hope they never do that in Fairfax County.\nAs many people know, bullying is a problem at many schools. Students hear the constant bickering, and teasing that often means that someone is getting bullied. This is another reason why I think that schools should not make their students participate in after school activities. Some students who get bullied at school laughÂ then so they don't appear a certain way to the people around them, when really they're holding back tears. After school is just another opportunity for a bully to strike, and a more welcoming opportunity at that. When you stay after school, their are less teachers and students around, making the bully more likely to act then. One day I hope that adults realize how difficult it can be to come to school and stay after to.\nI think that students should not be required to stay after school because of serious events at home are more important, some students have learning disabilities, and after school is just another opportunity for bullying to occur. I hope that next time you find yourself requiring someone to stay after school, remember to listen to and consider the person you're requirings concerns.Â Â Â Â Â",

Even though extracurricular activities are important they are hard for some to do. Many parents and kids nowadays don't have time for these activities with all the work and homework they have to do. Also some kids have disabilities or mental disabilities that cause problems when they are trying to do activities like football or yearbook club. In my opinion forcing extracurricular activities on kids is wrong because some parents and kids don't have time, and some kids with disabilities or mental disabilities might have trouble with rigorous activity.\nIn schools all across America kids have homework, it's unavoidable, children have to work hard no matter which school they go to. Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others. In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities. Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress. Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule. An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents. This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time.\nIn many American schools kids are burdened by a disability or mental disability. These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil. This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities. The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids. It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work. Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case. While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricularÂ activities because of their underlying issues.\nThis is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lotÂ of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities justÂ don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong. I can't believe the principal is even considering doing this, but what do you think? Should extracurricular activities be required?Â Â",

        "I would agree with the principal about participating in one extracurricular activity so people can have fun, make new friends,and try out new things. I think participating in an activity would be a good way to go out and meet new people. You can meet people who are very fun to hang out with. It would be a good way to open out and instead of staying home you can be at school doing after school activities. For example I use to be scared doing after school activities because I was new and I didn't know anyone but I signed up for football and i got to know other people and I started to like playing football.Â I also stayed for other sports and I met so many peopleÂ and got closer to them andÂ I was really happy because I wouldnt have to be home being bored all the time.\nTrying out new things would also be fun and you can learn how to play a new sport and become good at it. Other activities like the year book is also fun because you can be creative with the book. Doing the year book can teach you many things and it can let out a lot of stress and can relax you. I would also find it fun doing the yearÂ book because I've always wonder how you make the year book and when they come out they always look very pretty.\nI think it would be fun for people to try new things to be adventurous and stay at school doing fun activities. It's fun playing or being creative and being around people who are also fun. Participating in activity would also be a goodÂ idea because you can be doing something good instead of being outside probably doing something bad or doing nothing at all. So yes, I would agree with the principal of participating in a activity.",

        'You have just scored the game winning goal for your soccer team. ""Goal"", the crowd roars. Your team crowds around you with joy. This is a famillar feeling for students who take part in extracurricular activities. Whether its the newspaper club, robotics club, or the football team. These students get to feel a sense of acomplishment when he or she takes part in extracurricular activities. Therefore all students should be required to take part in an extracurricular activity. Joining these activities will help students make friends, explore future carrer options, and learn life lessons.\nStudents will be able to make new friends if they are required to take extracurricular activities. For example they will be able to find students with simillar hobbies as them. To add on students will learn communication skills which they can use to make firends. For instance if a student were to join soccer they would have to talk to eachother to know who to pass the ball to and when. Lastly they will meet more of their new peers who are also apart of the same club or sport who they might have not ever met before. In conclusion extracurricular activities help students make friends.\nExtracurriculars also help students explore future carrer options. First of all students can figure out what they are good at and explore future jobs that match those skills. For example if a student was in the yearbook club and he or she was really good at drawing they could look into future carrers as an artist or graphic designer. Also speakers come in every two months and speak about their jobs and how students could pursue their dream jobs. Furthermore students have a chance to get a scholarship to college for doing a sport. Then they could continue that sport in college. Also being good at a sport will make it easier for them to get into their dream college. Which is why extracurriculars help students explore future carrer choices.\nLastly by requiring students to take extracuriculars students learn important life lessons. For example student learn how to be good leaders. This is because in extracuriculars there is always a captain selected if you are selected as captain you learn how to be a good leader but, if u aren\'t selected as the leader you learn how to be a team player and how to follow a leader. To add on you learn how to balance your time. Therefore you must be able to keep up with all the stuff you have to do in your club and your school work at the same time. Lastly another life lesson you learn in clubs is how to communicate properley and respectfully with your fellow peers. These are a few of the may life lessons you learn while taking part in an extracurricular activity.\nAll students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurriculars encourage and help students make friend, explore future carrer options, and learn life lesseon. As a student body we must stress to all students how important it is to follow the principals wishes and, join extracurricular activities. Â Â Â',

        "Extracurricular activities should be a choice not a rule. Students should be able to do these activities for fun. I know teachers will think this is fine, but no some of us need to study for tests. We don't want bad grades so we will get held back a grade, or get kicked out of honor classes\nStudents have a life outside of school, and don't want to do thing against their will. They want to play games and chat with their companions; something they don't want to do is not the solution. If that happens they will soon have more things to do on their hands. That is something that can cause stress. Which can lead to lack of sleep for upcoming test, or quizzes that are already to much handle with.\nAfter school, students will get help after school from teachers with homework. Since Extracurricular activities might get added. They will have to do practices, instead ofÂ getting help with work. Students will have to try to figure it out in class without any clue.\nStudents sometimes will come late to class, or even miss a day of school.

Students will miss a big amount of information they needed for a test.

Some students will disagree with me saying, \"\"We do choose to do this, but if we don't are grades will drop.\"\" Nobody wants wants bad grades, which is why this is makes students feel like they have no choice.\nWe the students should have a choice to do activities for fun, and choice what we do with our free time. We should not be forced to do something we don't want to do. I hope this changes the principal's mind.",

        "Imagine being on a field and you just scored the winning goal while your school is chanting your name. Being involved in an extracurricular activity at your school can have so many benefits and even receiving little compliments that make your day can be a benefit. Students should participate in at least one extra curricular activity because they can show off their talents,have fun,and develop life skills.\nOne benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity is that students can get a chance to show off their talents such as in sports. A student could be insecure about other things going on in their life like family issues or friendship problems and they could have this one activity that can make them feel good and proud about themselves. Being proud of yourself is a very important aspect and everyone should have something they are proud about so they can show it. Another amazing part about showing off your talent is that it could influence others to try and find their hidden talent. You could change someone's life by influencing them and all they might have needed was somebody to reassure them to try. Lastly,it can make the people around you proud such as your family,friends,school and community. Knowing you made the people who love you proud is heartwarming and everyone should be able to experience that. Showing your talent is not the only benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity.\nAnother benefit you can get from joining an activity at school is you get to have fun such as working on the yearbook. Having the same everyday routine after schoolÂ can be very boring and you could get tired of it so changing your schedule, it could even be by a little, can be fun. Trying new things can be entertaining and can be good for you in many ways. Another way activities can be fun is you are able to make new friends who have the same interests as you and enjoy certain things you enjoy as well. Making new friends can impact you in many ways such as impacting who you are. Lastly,having fun before you enter adulthood is very important since you might not be able to do all these activities when you grow up. Have all the fun you can as a kid before it all gets taken away from you. Having fun is one of the many benefits about joining an activity at your school.\nHowever, some people don't think students should join an extra curricular activity. Some people may think this because students already have to do so much at home and they are already so busy. This is wrong because students should be able to learn and have life skills for their future. Having time management is something every student should be able to do before entering adulthood and why not practice now? When we become adults we are going to have a lot of work on our hands and we aren't going to know how to manage all the work since we didn't have an previous experiences similar to this in school. Life skills are one of the most important skills there are.\nStudents should participate in at least one curricular activity. Learning something new about yourself,entertaining yourself,and learning skills for the future are all benefits of joining an activity at school. Go find you hidden talent and enjoy your childhood!

Playing a sport or serve on the student council or even working on the year book are some of the extracurricular activities a student can participate in. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would take students minds off of school work and its healthier for them.\nMy first reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it would take students minds off of school work. School can be very stressful and sometimes students just need to get away from all the test and homework. Participating in a extracurricular activity can help a student feel more relaxed and not worry about school that much. Students might even focus more in school and do better on there test.\nMy second reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it's healthy for students.

        "There is an unfortunate lack of participation in extracurricular activities at our school. Moreover, the effects of vaping, gangs, depression, and procrastination have taken a toll on the student body. Seldom do I encounter a student who has not experienced some of the aforementioned issues. Therefore, I agree with this decision because extracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made, students to focus more on school, and prevent students from engaging in illegal activities.\nExtracurricular activities allow for new friendships to be made. It is no secret that children are social creatures, and they require constant interaction with one another. If there were to be mandatory extracurricular activities, their need to interact will be fulfilled. Students engaged in an extracurricular activity will likely find more friends they can connect with, as another student taking part in the same activity may have similar interests as them. This will be different from a classroom environment, in which there may be students who do not share the same interests and thus unable to befriend each other. Without a doubt, extracurricular activities will be able to satisfy a child's need for social interaction and making friends.\nIn addition to helping students make friends, extracurricular activities can assist students with staying focused on school. These activities may provide ample opportunities for classmates to meet up and discuss homework. They also would encourage students to complete their homework once the activity is over. Extracurricular activities keep students in a productive environment, further their work ethic, dissuade them from returning home to do nothing but stare at their phones for hours at a time, and encourage them to finish homework. When a student eventually moves on to become an adult with a job and a family, they can use the experience they had gained while working with others in an extracurricular activity to help them become a functioning member of society. Certainly, extracurricular activities are instrumental in helping a student grow into an studious man or woman.\nExtracurricular activities prevent students from engaging in illegal activities. Gangs have made a resurgence in the school district lately, and students are partaking in crimes such as dealing drugs and vandalism. Furthermore, the teen vaping epidemic has severely impacted our school in particular. These illegal activities are fueled by depression, isolation, and bad grades. All of these issues can be rectified by implementing mandatory extracurricular activities. As mentioned above, extracurricular activities can provide students with ways to socialize and improve their academic situations. A troubled student may not be able to find time to meet with a gang or purchase a vaping device when they are involved in an extracurricular activity. Without any reason or time to break the law, order may be restored in the school and the consequences of gang violence and vaping may be avoided. Then, the troubled student can academically succeed and grow up to be a law abiding citizen.\nI support the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because of their ability to form new friendships between students, make students focus more on academics, and eliminate the possibility of students consistently breaking the law. After this rule is implemented, the school, no doubt, will become a much friendlier and productive place for students.Â Â Â",

Kids should also have multipul choices to choose what they wanna do because here they only give them like three options that honestly is not far well thats my opinon other people might think other wise. I also agree because it will help kids get personal stuff outta there mind example parents fighting,getting bullied,over thinking,depression,there are many more examples these are just ones that came out of my mind because i wouldnt really think about stuff like this. Student council is actually really good i used to be in it but i got kicked out because my behavior and grades when i was in it i didnt put much effort like i didnt care about it but it was the only thing that had my grades good and now since im not in it i never have anything to do i wish i would have not behave the way i had so i would have not gotten kicked out but it is what it is. The principal actually is thinking because he does what new things for them in life so when they grow up they can say i did this i didnt do this and on the other hand if u dont do that you wont be able to even have fun you have to try new things in life because without trying you wont get anywhere in life. I also think they should have more options for the students to choose because not all students might like those options maybe they have other things in mind like gaming like you never know what they could be thinking you should let them speak out maybe they have even better ideas you never know because students have open minds some people dont know that.

        'Have you ever wondered ""what if making students do at least one extracurricular could help them improve in school""? I know many people who have thought about that and truth be told, they are right. I agree with the principle that students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Doing this can help students do better in school, get better at playing any sports that they are interested in, and can help relive students who are stressed out from school or home.\ndo have a students who is struggling in school due to lack of knowledge and understatement? Staying after school for an educational extracurricular can and will help students do better in school. I have taken a language and struggled to understand and comprehend it, but at my school they provide us with after school clubs that are also extracurricular\'s. So one day I decided to stay after for a french extracurricular that I ended up really enjoying, so I started to go every day that it was offered, I started realized how much of an impact it made on my grade I went from having a C to an A. This is one of the many impacts an educational extracurricular activity can have of your students.\nHave you ever been really interested in a sport but not knowing how to play it?\nIf you think about it, Labron James was not always as amazing of a basketball player as he is now. The reason he is so good is because of how much time, effort and motivation he put into his practices. Staying after for a sport can put you on your path to being able to succeed to doing well at the sport. That is why it is so important to have after school sport extracurricular activities to help students who have a dream of playing the sport professionally accomplish it.\nStudents who feel more stressed out from school or home are less likely to do as well in school as others. Students who have parents who make them do homework as soon as they get home without a break feel more stressed, and probably wont put in as much effort as they would is they got a break. At my school they provide us with after school downtime clubs to help students relive their mind. It also helps students get the break that is needed form a hard working day at school, and students are more likely to have better grade outcomes.\nThis is why is it good for students to be required to do at least on extracurricular activity after school. They will help students do better in school, help students who are interested in playing any sports get better, and will help students who are stressed from school feel more relived. So next time you doubt what amazing powers of extracurricular activities remember how much of great of an effect it can have on students.Â Â Â',

        "Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity so they can make friends and do what the like without being forced. It also can help students get out of there shy zone and do something they like or enjoy, and just be themselves. I agree that all students should have to participate in at least one activity like the yearbook, helping teachers, and sports.\nOne activity they could do is help teachers with students. When a teacher is teaching and some students are having a hard time understanding the lesson they can help there class mates, since it's only one teacher and about twenty students. The teacher can't help everybody at one time so one student can be their little helper. So if one student understand the lesson then they can help the teacher with the other students. Also they can help grade papers with the teacher. So the students can get there paper back faster and see if they were successful or if they need more practice and studying time. So like if they got a 60% on there test then they know they can stay after school and get extra help so they can pass next time. One more thing is students are scared to ask questions because they think people will mess with them for getting help, so they just stay quiet and not get the help they need.\nAnother activity they could participate in is the yearbook club. The yearbook is like an important thing in school because it holds all the amazing memories that happen throughout the school year. What makes it fun is the students can go all around the school and take pictures. Also they can decorate the book and make is enjoyable for others. When students are participating in the yearbook it means they can make new friends and be be more active. If the students get caught in school taking pictures all the time, then ask them if they want to be apart of the yearbook club and they can take pictures all they want and not get in trouble. The yearbook club should be a place the students can be free, have fun, and not have to have a teacher yelling at them all the time for something small.\nOne final thing student's can participate in is sports. Some students love sports but scared to try out because they think their not good enough for the team, so they just sitÂ back and stay quiet or d nothing. If sports is something students' like to do then they should do it if it's basketball. football, soccer, or anything else then do it. Students have the right to do what they want without having to be asked or blackmailed. Like if a student is in GYM class and not doing anything then out of nowhere the coach says \"\"if you don't participate in the game then i'm calling your parents\"\". So let the students choose when they are going to join in a game. If some students want to play soccer but the others want to play basketball, then have one side of the court basketball and the other soccer. So they all can do what they like and have fun.\nI agree that student's should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as the yearbook club, helping the teacher, and sports. So the students can feel free at those times and have fun doing what makes them happy. Â Â Â",

        "The principal has stated that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity can be best defined as an activity that does not have to do with main school subjects, these can be sports, clubs, etc. Having an extracurricular activity can be very beneficial to students and teachers alike. People can join clubs, sports, or student committees which can help the school run smoothly and possibly even get it awards, if the teams do well. It can help the teachers refine the way they teach and help the students learn in an improved way. Finally, this can help the students in many ways, such as giving them more social skills, getting help in a subject they need help in, helping to find a new skill, or helping to nurse and grow a current skill.\nThe first way that having extracurricular activities is helpful and beneficial to students is the fact that these can help grow social skills. Many people in school don't really talk to others, they mainly stay either focused on their studies or on their personal problems, this leaves them open to bullying or, worse even mental health problems such as depression. This is because they feel that no one gets them and that they are all alone in school, being in a club, however, could let them talk to other people and spill their feelings about problems. Even if they feel that their problems are their own business, they could talk about things that they do in their free time, what games they play, hobbies, or views on certain subjects. Even if people don't have problems, they could be solely focused on learning and not talking to people, because they may feel that this is just a mere distraction from what is truly important. However, these people need to talk to people so that they don't develop depression or worse mental illnesses, which is where a club or social group could help.\nAnother way that this can be beneficial is in the field of academics. Many people in school are very talented, but they just don't understand a certain subject or problem, and teachers have many other students to worry about, so they may end up missing them. This could make the struggling student feel resentful, and start making them feel that the teacher doesn't care and that they should just give up, since there is no one to help, especially if their parents are too busy or if they don't seem to care. If they were to join a study club, things could change, someone else in the club could step up and help, better yet a teacher could help the student and they could help solve the problem and possibly even change the way they teach to help more students understand a particularly difficult topic. Going to this study club could also help people who are more focused on studies talk to other people or teach them, because it's said that you don't truly know something until you teach it, so this could be a learning experience for both sides.\nThe final way that this program can benefit the school would be it could let students find new athletic skills. More and more people now have started to just sit around and play video games or look at social media, this means that there is a higher risk of obesity in younger generations, it also means that they aren't getting enough sunlight to keep their bodies healthy. Despite many people thinking that saying this is just an excuse to get them outside, sunlight actually gives us the vitamin D we need to survive, so joining a sports team or even a hiking club can let people become more fit and healthy, and it could let them talk to people face to face, instead of over a chat, which will make them know that this is a real person, and someone their age who can be interested in the same things as them. For someone who wants to try out for something, but doesn't know if they have the skill, they could join a small club and practice for a sport to grow their skills. This could also let a person learn something new about themselves, such as finding a new ability that they didn't know they had, which could inspire self confidence in them. Along with that, this could lead to an influx of talented people which could help the sports teams out and potentially even lead them to championshipsÂ which would give the school large amounts of recognition.\nAs stated in the above three points, the principal's new plan is a very good idea that can be beneficial for all parties involved. Having at least one extracurricular activity lets students be fit and healthy, and it could also let themÂ socialize, build confidence, and work on schoolwork at the same time. Along with that, it could allow students who are already knowledgeable about something test how much they really understand it. This could also let teachers refine the ways they teach their subjects and also identity who might need more help than others which could let them do their job in a much better way. This project could help the school because if the students are getting higher scores and the teachers are doing a better job at teaching, then it could get the school more recognition. All of these would ultimately lead to a school that is vastly superior to others.",

Many students are pressured to sign up for sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities by parents, friends, and teachers. This ensures that they are getting physical activity, time off electronics, and are spending time with their community. However, students should not be forced to participate in these extracurricularÂ activitiesÂ because of their homework and jobs, lack of time spent with their families and friends, and the money some families do not have to pay for these activities.\nStudents' lives are almost always busy, and many rarely have a chance to relax. First, they have to spend eight hours of their day in school, only to go home and do two hours of homework. After that homework, many students go work jobs to save for college or build a resume. Even after that job has ended, students go home and may have to help do chores around the house. Only after those fourteen hours of the day have flown by is the student allowed to finally get ready for bed, struggle to get their required eight hours of sleep, and wake up only to do it all again. With this crowded schedule, it would be near impossible to manage an after school activity that lasts about two hours on top of all that. Kids should be able to enjoy their childhood by hanging out with their friends and relaxing, not having to worry about how the yearbook is coming along, if the sports teams are doing well this season, and if the school has the budget for prom at the end of the year. Those are enrichment activities that people without as busy lives should be able to choose to partake in, not forced to.\nPeople hear a lot that they should strive to spend quality time with their friends and family, to ensure they don't become a little hermit that lives in a secluded world of their own. On top of the already insane schedule many students maintain, there's very little time left for spending time with friends and loved ones. Many students miss out on going to the mall on weekends with their friends, going out on dates with their significant other, and laughing at movies with their parents and siblings because they're busy working, applying to colleges, or doing homework that a teacher assigned to them over the weekend. Forcing them to participate in extracurricularÂ activities does not benefit the situation at all. On top of not being able to spend time with the people that mean most to them, they're being told to run laps at sports practices, waking up at dawn to get ready for the big game, taking pictures for the yearbook at events, or going to meetings with the other student government members to plan the school dance. This causes immense stress for students, and it also weakens the bonds and strains the relationships between students and their friends and family.\nIt's not exactly difficult to see the fact that many students' families struggle financially. Many times, the only time students ever get to eat is at school, and often don't have enough money for hygiene, clothes, or school supplies. If these students are forced to participate in these after school activities, they may not be able to afford it; if they can, it often becomes even more of a struggle for the family, as that money could have been spent on paying the bills or food, rather than it being spent on sports uniforms and gas for cars that need to be driven to and back from practices, meetings, and events. Sports tend to be very expensive, with registration fees, uniforms, proper equipment, gas to drive the students places, and snacks to provide after school, as many students need to eat during practices. ninety percent of Americans are already in some sort of debt, whether it's student loans, house mortgage, cars, or just bad spending. Adding the cost of sports or other after school activities will drown students and their families in bills that they may not be able to pay off.\nAlthough it is a good idea for students to participate in extracurricular activities, they should never be forced to because it impacts many students negatively because of their busy schedules, lack of time with their friends and loved ones, and because of the financial struggles many students' families face and may not be able to afford. Instead, students should be able to say whether they can and want to participate in these activities, or be able to not do extracurricular activitiesÂ and be able to relax and spend their leisure time however they please.",

        "Some schools or principals say that taking a extracurricular can be good for many students . This means students can take extra or another class other than your, Civics, Science, English, or Math. Some classes can be yearbook crew, photography crew or maybe a computer crew! Anything is a good choice.\nBeing in a extracurricular class can help you learn something new. When being in a extracurricular class means you learn something different than your usual subjects.\nYou can have chance to learn your favorite subject example;Art. Extracurricular classes makes you open your mind to other things or be open mined. When you want a job on the class you are taking, it can help you have a better understanding if what that subject or job, is going to be about. People still take their usual classes, but they might need more help. So they take a extra class to help them get better at the subject they are struggling with.\nWhen is a extracurricular class or activity you can be more social or make more friends. When in extra activity class you are most likely be in a group of people. Being in a group with a lot of people can make you more social and have a voice. Communication is key, so when you are in a group you can be better at communication. When being social you meet someone that you feel more comfortable talking to. For example, when you are in a class that you or, a student doesn'tÂ feel comfortable talking in you can talk to the teacher cause maybe, they are the only person in the room you are comfortable talking with.\nIn some certain classes you can go traveling or go on a trip. For example, if you are taking a music class than, you can choose to go on the trip. This also helps you getting out of the house more. Some students love to travel sometimes it helps them learn new thing on a subject. When travelingÂ in a school trip you probably wont have your parents there with you, cause they might have work. So when you go on a trip by yourself, it teaches you how to take care of yourself and how to be more dependent. Some students have bad parents so traveling with your friends and taking a break from your mom or dad can be a good thing for some students. However, some students or parents think its bad for students to go off on their own. Some say that it can be dangerous and that something might happen to their child.\nBeing in a extracurricular activity isn't always a bad thing. It can maybe get you into a good job in the future. There are many reasons on why taking a extracurricular class or activity.",

        "Should students be required to attend extracurricular activities? Would this really help students and provide enjoyable experiences? While there are some good things that could come out of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities, there are some downsides as well. Personally, I disagree with the decision to require all students to participate in the activities because some students may not enjoy doing extracurricular activities, or simply might not have any time to attend them. Extracurricular activities do give some students the opportunity to expand their knowledge in certain areas, spend time with friends, and maybe help them find their passion in life, but other students may not be as positively impacted in the same way as others.\nSo, there are the students who don't enjoy participating in extracurricular activities. There are many students who don't prefer to do these activities because perhaps they are socially awkward and would rather avoid social interaction. Maybe there just isn't an activity that is available to them that is of interest. Another reason is that they might enjoy doing something else that doesn't qualify as an extracurricular activity. It isn't right that the principal is forcing students to do something they don't want to do. Students should be able to choose what they want to do and how to spend their time. Some may learn how to enjoy an activity after joining one they were unsure about, but others may end up not enjoying the experience at all, therefore, giving them something not to look forward to that was forced upon them with the intention of a positive impact.\nOther students may not like the decision that requires them to attend extracurricular activities, specifically activities held after school hours, because they already have plans, and being forced to attend activities would break in to their already-planned schedules. Scheduled plans such as family events; religious events; sporting events that don't directly involve the student; work hours for a job; or perhaps just time to finish schoolwork. All of these examples are things that students may not feel obligated to cancel, just so they can attend an activity that was forced upon them. There will obviously be some times when students are allowed to miss out on the extracurricular activities they are supposed to attend, but why give students a sense of worry about not being able to go to an event that they might feel very obligated to attend?\nOnce again, I disagree with the decision to force students for participate in extra curricular activities because some may not enjoy doing them, and others may not have time to attend them. The fact is, is that the principal should not be forcing students to attend extracurricular activities. The principal should be giving every student the opportunity to find one and attend one if they wish to, but never have it be mandatory that they do. Many students do enjoy attending extracurricular activities, but it is important to consider the few who don't when making a decision like this.Â",

        "Generic_Name enjoyed going to school so he could socialize with friends and learn about new things. That all changed when his principle decided to make every student required to participate in one or more extracurricular activity. This greatly angered Generic_Name and his parents; many other students felt the same way as he did. None of the activities listed spiked an interest in Generic_Name, but he was forced to participate in one. All the activities took a considerable chunk of time from him which resulted him losing time with his family and friends. Generic_Name thought to himself, \"\"Why do I have to do these extremely boring and useless activities?\"\" Over the course of several weeks, these activities continued and his stress level skyrocketed; his grades started to plummet due to all his stress and he also lost some friends due to his increased irritation due to the activities. He felt like these extracurricular activities have ruined his life. Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because they may not have interest in any of the activities, they may not have the time to participate in any actives and, students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need.\nOne of the more important reasons why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because that they may not be interested in any of the activities. When students are forced to do something they don't enjoy, it makes them frustrated and not willing to work. If students and not interested in an activity, why force them to it as it will interfere with the students that are genuinely interested in the activity? A supporter of required extracurricularÂ activities would say that it allows students to try new things that they may enjoy. However, this is just not the case for most students because students can determine what an activity would be like with the given information. Most people would not want to do something they don't enjoy, so why make the students do it?\nA contributing factor to why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because that students may not have the time to participate in any activities. As more and more students do activities not related to the school, they would not be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Students may also not have time due to them being with family and friends and students should have to be away from family and friends if they don't want to. A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that students would manage their time wisely. That is false due to the fact that students may not be able to change to time for their other activities and they might only to be able to see their family and friends at certain times. If students don't have the time for extracurricular activities, they shouldn't have to participate in them.\nThe most important reason why students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is because students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need. As students already spend up to seven hours a day in school, they shouldn't have to spend anymore time than they want. What students want to do after school should be up to them, not the school. Forcing students to do something unneededÂ that takes up their precious time is just wrong; Student's time should not be stolen like this. A supporter of extracurricular activities would say that forcing students to participate in these activities would be beneficial them. This is not the case because students would not get a benefit from being forced, it would be the opposite. Students shouldn't be forced to do something, they should have the option to do something, but not be forced.\nThough extracurricular activities may be beneficial to some, it is not for all students. Students should not be required to take extracurricular activities because they may not have interest in any of the activities, they may not have the time to participate in any actives and, students should not be forced to spend any more time at school than they need. If students were forced to do extracurricular activities, it would be problematic for the students and the school. Students should be able to decide how they want to spend their youth, not the school. If you could change any of my reasons, what would you change?",

        "Research has shown that exercising does help you live longer. However what if you were forced to do a sport or something after school that is not a sport? Me personally I disagree, but I am going to talk about my opinions on why right now.\nPeople shouldn't have to do anything after schoolÂ if they don't want to. Staying after school is a opportunity to have fun and see some of your friends. Therefore if it was forced it would defiantly not be as much fun because you wouldn't want to do it. Nobody should be forced to do something if they don't want to.\nThere are other things people want or have to do sometimes instead of staying after school everyday. It would take away some of the fun. For instance what if someone wants to go out of town but they can't because they have to stay after school. Additionally people have other things to do outside of school, things like ballet, basketball for someplace else, maybe any sport, etc.. If they did then they would be burned out like a fire in the rain.\nHaving homework and having to stay after everyday would be terrible. With having to stay after school also comes homework. We at least have one thing to do everyday, sometimes more. With that being said some after schoolÂ activities last 2:30-4:00 or 2:30-6:30. Homework usually takes 20 minutes tops depending on what it is, but when you have 2 or 3 things to do you can't go to bed until late. Also studying can be hard with an after schoolÂ activity because that really takes a long time. Additionally, you still have to shower and do things to prepare for the next day which makes you go to bed even later when you have to wake up at 5:30-6:30AM. Only that is whole different subject for a while different time.\nStaying after school is fun but if you were forced it would change everything. People stay after because they want to, not because they are forced too. It would defiantly not be fair if people were forced too. That is my opinion on this question.",

        'Starting at a young age and throughout their life, every child and person wants to be great at something. If you look at the people who are truly great at what they do, they all started their passion at a young age. Many sports players, politicians, and people in all fields are a great example of this. Quite frankly, extracurricularÂ activities are a great way to spur interest within students in their youth. For this reason, I believe that the principal made the right decision about making students do at least one extracurricular activity. Beside for getting students to develop an interest and passion for something at a young age, extracirrular activities also help people become more confident in their abilities. Additionally, with all of these options, there has to be at least one activity for each student to have an interest in.\nAs I stated earlier, extracurricular activities are a great way to get students to find a new interest. For all you know, the student may really like the activity and pursue it as a profession. Without being required to do the activity, the student may not have even discovered their interest in whatever the activity is. Requiring students to do extracurricular is a great way to open new door and possibilities for the student. There are many different activities the student can take, so at least one has to be appealing. By finding out what they have an interest in, and starting at a young age, the student will have plenty of time to develop the skills need at get really good at something. It is important to be unique in at least one thing, because it helps identify who you are as a person. Even if the student does not ""fall in love"" with their activity, it still could not hurt to try something new.\nStaying on the topic of learning something new, extracirrular activities are a great way to get students out of their comfort zone and to build up self-confidence. If the school did not require the student to take an extracurricular activity, chances are that the student would not have tried out something new. By making students try something new or continue something that they are already good at, it is making them better at whatever they are doing. This boosts their confidence level, and makes them want to try even more new things. Additionally, many of these clubs and activities include working with other people and students. This means that these clubs help students with their communication, organization, and teamwork skills. Personally, I am on my school\'s debate team, and I enjoy not only having fun and tournaments, but also working with my friends that are also on the team. Even though I do not really plan on becoming a lawyer or politician, I still feel as if being on the team has made me a more confident and clear speaker. Helping develop important life skills is once again another benefit of making requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity.\nWhether it is a sport, club, or leadership position, there is always something for each and every student. Based on the field that the person wants to go in, they can do an activity that is related to that field. For example, if the person wanted to be a politician, they could do something relating to the student council. Out of the many choices for extracurricular activities, at least one has to fit each student. Even if the student is not sure what they want to be, there are also plenty of options such as sports that are plenty of fun!\nAlthough some people may say that it is not right to force somebody into doing an activity, or say that there are better things the person can do with that time, the whole purpose of requiring students to do after schoolÂ activities is so they can get better. Not only do extracurricularÂ actitivites help give students important life skills, but they also give students a chance to gain an interest and passion in an activity. If anything, it just giving the students another opportunity to try out something new. It is almost guaranteed that every student will find something that they can manage, so there is no downsides of requiring students to do extracurricularÂ activities.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it is best for people start something at a young age, and requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a great way to do that.Â',

Everyone having at least one extracurricular activity gives us students the chance to develop their skills and talents, it'll give us experience for our future work place, and give us a chance to make ever lasting friendships bettering the group efforts.\nWorking on an extracurricular activity can help us learn talents and while developing older skills. Some students may learn important social skills and, other can develop those skills. Many students have hidden talents yet, might not ever be able to use it if they're just doing standard desk work. I hope with this new rule we can all express ourselves while learning from valuable experience.\nIn recent years, studies have shown that 66% of students who joined a club or have done an extracurricular have a higher chance of getting into colleges or getting a job. A lot of people can benefit from extra work experiences. Jobs and colleges are looking for talented individuals who know how to work. I think that is reason enough to start this program.\nThese activities give students who only want to socialize with people like them a place to meet others. Students with similar interests working together can be a force of good. When you get to learn and work beside those who you are comfortable with you'll do and feel much better.

        'Imagine a school where no student feels left out and everyone has a group of friends where they belong. The students are genuinely happy to be in school, are generally in a good mood, and are also doing well academically. This would be the result of all students participating in an extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity is any activity that someone does outside of school, like sports, working on the yearbook committee, or serving on the student council. Our principal should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will encourage students to make friends and develop new skills.\nRequiring students to participate in extracurricular activities gives them the opportunity to make new friends.Â Anyone who has been a part of a team or club knows that when someone is a part of a group, they form friendships that can last. Additionally, students who were always too afraid to be themselves at school would have a second chance at doing so by buiding confidence.Â Having friends is important because friends can make a person happier overall and give them a sense of belonging. Making friends outside of school will also earn them more friends in school. Soon, the empty nearby seats at the lunch table will be occupied with people that a student met at one of their extracurricular activities.Â Some people may not be very social at school, but participating in an activity outside of school will give them the chance to speak up and form strong friendships.\nWhether a student is interested in doing sports, cooking, or participating in an academic competition for their extracurricular activity, they will develop several important skills along the way.Â The most obvious skill they will develop: being able to do that particular activity. However, students will also develop leadership skills, collaboration skills, and many other skills that can be applied to tasks and activities that they will do in the future. For example, one extracurricular activity that I participate in is dance. Dance has taught me how to work well in a team because I have to work with the other girls in my group to create unified movements. Dance has also taught me leadership skills and teaching skills because I often teach dance classes for the students at a lower level. I have the responsibility of deciding what they need to accomplish that day, and then executing it. Like dance, extracurricular activities can teach students important skills, that will benefit them in school and in the future.\nIn the end, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will only benefit them by giving them the opportunity to make new friends and develop important skills.Â If someone is marked as the ""shy kid"" at school and doesn\'t have friends, participating in an extracurricular activity will build their confidence to speak up and make friends. Extracurricular activities can also teach students important life lessons and give them skills that will improve their work and relations in school and in the future.Â All in all, requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a decision that at first glance seems terrible because it takes away the students\' freedom, but in reality, it will have many positive effects on their lives.',

Doing that could cause a lot of stress on many of people.Â That being said, the parents of those students would then have to worry extra about any activity their children is participating in. Now, think about all the trouble the kids that are disrespectful would cause. That would mean more trouble-making kids to deal with all the time. I disagree with this decision because not all students have the extra time, permission from their parents, or they might even abuse this privilege.\nFirst off, have you ever thought about how much spare time another person has on a day-to-day basis? Many students have a set routine that gives them a plan of what they do everyday. Whether or not that includes chores, time with their family, or even a job that gets them some money. Putting that responsibility on the kids and parents will cause a lot of chaos. This would mean working parents struggling to find a ride for their kid, or even the kids who might already struggle with time management with the stuff they have to do everyday.\nNow think back, has anybody, even your parents, ever told you no, that you can't do something?\nAll children face this answer everyday; It may be about going to their friends house, or asking to stay home from school. Just imagine a pair of very busy parents, or even a single parent, having their kid ask if they can participate in a extracurricular activity. Their first thought could be, \"\"This is going to affect my work schedule and I can't loose anymore money.\"\" If they get told no by their parents, while this rule is enforced, it may cause them to get in trouble by their principle or teacher.\nLastly, have you ever hosted or attendedÂ an event thatÂ a lot of people showed up at? If so, you know there are some people who don't care about anyone else and will cause trouble wherever they go and whenever they want. If that were to happen at a school, and the children who see it go home and tell their parents, the school would get a lot of complaints. After a certain amount of complaints the school would start to be questioned by higher authorities and they may even be looked down upon. Some students will get that type of opportunity and abuse it. They will cause as much mischief and chaos as they can. They may cause fights, be disrespectful to their mentor, or even damage school property.\nIf you haven't already realized how this decision could affect a school, then hopefully you understand it now. There may be a handful of students that care about participating in school activities or sports. But not every student is that way. Making all the students at a school participate in a extracurricular activity could cause a lot of problems, with the students or parents. This decision would be a big problem because some students may not have the time, they may cause a lot of trouble and are disrespectful, or they may have parents who are too busy for any extra activities.Â",

        "I agree that students should have an extracurricular activity. It can help them stay active, and also help the school out a lot. Having an extracurricular activity means having a extra thing to do in school that you like that will provide for the school; like for an example: being the school announcer in the morning it's something that you like that will provide for the school and it is why students should have an extracurricular activity.\nThe extracurricular activity is 3 to students and it will help them pursue in the future. Example: say if Generic_Name was very shy to talk in front of a class, but he really want to become a businessÂ man and it requiresÂ talking in front of is business partners about business, but he still to shy to talk; so he does a extracurricular activity about debating and he found confidence in his self, and now he can talk in front of class presentationsÂ and it will help him to become a better business man. that's an example of the effects that it do to a student's character.\nExtracurricular activity's can also give some relive to the principal's, if the students help out the principal than the the principal won't have too much too do on that day like for dances, pep rallies, and meetings and thats why students should have an extracurricular activies.",

        "Have you ever participated in an extracurricular activity before?\nWho or what made you participate or join that extracurricular activity and benefit from it? Many schools convince or make students participate in extracurricular activities such as sports, working on the year book,or serving on the student council to make them active in order to prevent them from being idle apart from school basedÂ activities. I agree that our principle should make us participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents.\nThe first reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it keeps us fit and healthy. For instance,take a sport such as basketball. Most basketball players are fit and healthy because basketball serves as a physical activity which makes them be in a very good shape for any situation. Playing basketball can also make people healthy by burning fat from their bodies and preventing their blood vessels from being clogged. Being fit and healthy means a lot to the school ,and that is why the principle should make us participate in extracurricular activities\nThe second reason I agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is that it can improve our brain function. Apart from school activities, students can also acquire more knowledge to improve their brain function by participating in extracurricular activities. I once read an article on a website named \"\"Gale.\"\" It stated that scientists have proven that students that have participated extracurricular activities in schools have improved brain function and has made them more attentive, more quite and more discipline ,but I didn't believe that until my friend from another school,which has extracurricular activities,told me he joined the student's council. At first, I told him it wasn't going to do him any but in a few weeks, I noticed changes about my friend. He had become much more brilliant and more knowledgeable. He told me it was because he joined the students council and it improved the ability of his brain to think and to act some ways. So improved brain functions of students is one thing we would benefit from if our school was introduced to extracurricular activities.\nThe final reason\nI agree that the principle should make students participate in extracurricular activities is thatÂ it can help students find their unknown talents. An example I would like to share is that my elder sister was in high school ,and she participated in the extracurricular activities. At first, she didn't want to participate in it ,but my mom edged her to do it becauseÂ she saw her juggling her ball ,and my mom saw that she was very good at soccer. She could have made her join a youth team for soccer ,but she didn't have enough money. When my sister joined, she didn't perform well at all ,but when the coach motivated her, she showed her through colors. She led the school's women soccer team to win the district finals and the state finals. People always asked her where she had acquired these skills for soccer ,but she had only one answer,\"\" I didn't discover my talent until I joined my school's extracurricular activity.\"\" She is now a big superstar play in Europe for a club named Arsenal. So many talents can be revealed if the principle could make everyone participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\nIn conclusion, I agree that the principle should make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it keeps us fit and healthy, it improves our brain function and it can create an opportunity for students to find their talents although one might disagree with my decision.",

        "Imagine the sound of the school bell ringing, freedom, time to go home, it is a Friday after all, you get to go home and relax; but then you remember the new rule, all students must be signed up for an extra curricular activity. There goes another hour of my free time you mutter as you slowly walk towards your robotics club. Kids should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. Most kids have other prioritiesÂ whether it is limited time, or not wanting to be in a club, to even the stress of being forced into a social environment.\nThere is only one thing that is limited for every single person on the planet and that is time. Many kids feel that they dont have enough time already and if forced to join a club that only meets once a week for an hour that just cuts an hour off their free time that they could be doing other things. Many kids participate in a sports that are very time consuming. Most combative sports have multiple practices and games a week, along with practicing on your own. Another very time consuming part of every child'sÂ life is family, spending time with grand parents or even just having fun with your parents or siblings. Your family is the most important thing in your life and any time you can spend with them should be spent with them, not at school in leadership council. Finally your friends, every kid has a friend group and friends are a very important of every kids life. Your friends are who you go to for advice and who you learn many life lessons from.\nA huge part of middle school life is stress. It is impossible to never experience it about something. Homework is very stressful, having math, Spanish, science, English, and civics homework that is all due on one day is crazy, especially if you have less time than you usually would. Most kids have an hour and a half of homework each night with some nights being more. Imagine not getting home until 4:30 then having another hour and a half of homework, that means if you are focused and you can get your work done you don't have any free time until 6:00. Pets are another thing that stress many kids out. Knowing that you have to hurry home to let your dog out is stressful, and it is made much worse when you have to wait another hour before you can leave school. Another reason that kids shouldn't be forced to participate in clubs is the amount of kids with social anxiety. Many kids freak out at hearing that they are going to have to go out into public once, much less every week. If kids want to be in clubs they can but it isn't fair to make that a requirement.\nTo close, most kids who want to be in a club are in a club. Most of the kids who aren't in a club dont want to be and there is no reason to force those who would rather be at home with their family or having fun with their friends to be somewhere they don't want to be. Simply people have better things to do then be in a room with a ton of other people doing something that they aren't interested in. Clubs are great for kids that are interested in them and for kids who do want to be there, but when you add in a ton of students who would rather be elsewhere doing their own thing it just makes everything worse. Also there isn't enough space for everybody to be in their preferred club so there would be angry kids and parents demanding that they signed up for a different club then the one they are in.\nKids shouldnt be required to be in an extra curricular activity if they don't want to be. Students have more important things to do with their time, they have many different things causing them stress and most importantly they don't want to be in a club. There is no need to overcrowd clubs with grumpy kids that ruin everything for the kids who signed up to be there.",

        "Some people agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities instead of letting the students stay home and do what they want to. This is wrong and cause many problems. I disagree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments.\nThe first point is that students may not have time for these activities. For instance, students could be participating in other events that are not provided by the school. If students tried to participate in both activities, one could get in the way of another and cause issues. Students may also miss the activities because they are spending time with their families. If they were forced to go to these activities, they could loose the time they would be spending with their family by participating in the activities. Another problem that could occur is the parents not having the time to take their children their activities. This could be cause by work or any other event that the parents must attend.\nThe next point is that students may not be interested in the activities that their school provides. This could be because the school may not have many activities. If the school does not have many activities, some students will be left out and forced to choose one that they do not want to participate in. Another reason could be that the school does not have the money for specific activities. For example, a student may want to participate in wrestling, but the school cannot provide the needed gear and mats. This would mean that the student cannot participate in an activity that they would like to participate in.\nThe final point is that students may not be able to complete assignments. If a student has a very important test that they must take, they have to study for it. If the student cannot study for tests, they may get a poor grade. Students may also have projects or homework that must be completed. If they do not complete these things, the student's grade could fall and they would have to work harder to raise it. If they still did not have the time to work extra because of the required activity, they could suffer from an even poorer grade.\nIn conclusion, students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time to participate in these activities, they may not be interested in the activities that their school provides, and they may not be able to complete school assignments. If students are required to participate in these activities, many problems could arise. Â",

        "Ever wanted an opportunity to have fun and learn new things after school? Well extracurricular activities are perfect for that plus more! The principles decision to make extracurricular activities mandatory is incredible. After all, extracurricular activities are a great way to make new friends, learning new things, and give you an opportunity to help the school out.\nThe first reason that mandatory extracurricularÂ activities are beneficial, is you can make lots of new friends. In clubs you are surrounded by people with the same interests as you. This gives you an opportunity to share things with other people, connect, and work together. Whether it's on a sports team, or in the year book club you interact with new people and make some new friends. So get out of the house and make some new friends by joining an extracurricular club!\nThe second reason that they are beneficial, is think about all the new things you can learn, by joining extracurricular activities you learn new things through social interactions, or improve on pre-existing skills. Either way you learn tons of new things in these clubs. Also these clubs already exist, so why not join them? By not joining you are wasting the opportunity to learn and more importantly have some fun!\nFinally, one day you can put some of these clubs on your resume. It might sound crazy but it's true. If you are trying to get a job relating to coding, and you took the coding club as a kid, you can slap that on to your resume! That could be the difference between you getting the job and another person getting a job. You never know! My dad told me that he still remember some of the things he learned in a coding club and still applies that knowledge today. These clubs are free knowledge so take advantage!\nIn conclusion having mandatory extracurricular activities is beneficial because it gives you many social opportunities, you can learn many new and exciting things from these extracurricular activities, and these extracurricular activities can be used throughout life. If you school does not make this mandatory, you should join a club anyways. But choose wisely!",

        'Isolation. Nothing to do. That\'s what most kids do when they get home. Play video games or sit on their phones for hours. That\'s why schools should have students participate in one extracurricular activity. This could help make students happier and healthier, improve social skills, and give opportunities to explore their interest.\nOne reason schools should have students participate in one activity is because it makes students healthier and happier. Studies from John Hopkins university stated that ""9 out of 10 kids are happier when they participate in activities."" Which means more students are in a better mood because they\'re moving around and getting exercise. Getting kids to go outside can improve their mood swings. Not only does it help with mood swings, it also helps with depression. Healthier and happier students tend to be more happier in general\nAnother reason kids should have extracurricular activities is because it improves social skills. Professor Jimmy Facs, from University of New York, says, ""kids who get involved in out of school activities, have better social skills than kids that do not participate in anything. Also, getting involved in out of school activitiesÂ help kids with anxiety."" Facs basically is saying that out of school activities helps kids get out of their comfort zone. Pre-teens who have anxiety could feel more safe around the people at their school. Kids that participate in extracurricular activities could also meet new friends that they\'ve never talked to or even see before. Meeting new people could form a better community at this school.\nAnother important reason is that extracurricular activities could open up new opportunities or interest for students. A survey from students at Generic_School shows that 3 out of 4 students find a new hobby or interest that they enjoy. This means that kids could try something they\'ve never tried before. Finding more interests for students could help them open up their choices of what they want to become when they grow up. This could also help students find people who have the same interest.\nSome parents and students complain that they won\'t have time for homework. In an article produced by the Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City says, ""kids that participate in multiple sports still come home to homework. This could make the student stress and have a mental breakdown."" The Board of Supervisors of the Generic_City is stating that kids mental health is bad because they have multiple activities going on. Although some students say they get stressed from more extracurricular activities, most kids already participate in one. In an article by Generic_Name, she states, ""5 out students 6 say they already participate in sports. A student from Generic_School, Generic_Name, even says, \'I play 4 sports and I have never been stressed. Playing 4 sports actually makes me feel less stressed.\'"" Generic_Name is saying that most kids play sports to relax them. Relaxation makes students feel more focused in school. Putting all your anger into playing a sport can make students more calm when it comes to challenges. Less stress can help students loosen up.\nOverall, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It helps students be healthier and happier, improves their social skills, and opens up more opportunities. Activities benefits both you and your community. Your community can do is support sports by, going to a game. What you can do is, participate in an activity you\'ve never tried before. Open up more opportunities for yourself. See what\'s out there, you\'ll never know until you try.',

        "Schools should allow extracurricular activities and after school programs. It has been proven that most children show an increase in brain activity, creativity, and over all functionality when they have been and/or are currently doing an extracurricular activity. This includes sports such as football, basketball, baseball, soccer and many more outdoor activities that encourage physical health. These activities also include board games like scrabble, chess, and puzzles that help with brainÂ growth, comprehension and critical thinking skills.\nExtracurricular activities are always something someone should at leastÂ think about indulging one's self in. In any case an extracurricular activity could help you with a lot of obstacles in life; such as social struggles like making friends or speaking up in class or maybe less expressive things like focus and paying attention. These activities also help with confidence, self esteem and to a certain extent humility. Most extracurricular's teach teamwork and cooperation and in many cases how to make friends and conflict resolution. This usually resolves in great social and communication skills.\nAfter school activities and extracurricular activities in addition don't just help with mental and/or physical health, but they also do a lot for one's future as well. An extracurricular activity in the future could be used as a credit for a job or college regime; even allow a person to earn a scholarship for the activity that they have chosen to participate and even excelÂ in. Although most esteemed colleges do offer scholarships for physical sports, others often give scholarships for more academicÂ extracurricular's such as debate, mathematics and common knowledge quizzers. This is a great reason to motivate one to take on an extracurricular and better one's self.\nExtracurricular activities have become very important in the modern world. This because of the over usage of cellularÂ devices, most people don't talk face to face or even go outside at all. It is important that people indulge in extracurricular activities so that they can create a face to face sense of understanding and friendship in an environment where everything is digital. The needÂ for extracurricular activities is dire and has to comeback before the value of friendship is lost. Extracurricular activities maybe one of the most important things in this day and age.",

        "I agree with the principal that students should engage in some type of activity outside of school and their current form of education. If students were to do so, then they could meet others who share the same interests, which would benefit all students because they are doing things that they like to do, and at the same time, they are sharing the experience with others who enjoy doing the same activity. Extracurricular activities can help students to find and learn about a skill, whether it's one they've never tried before or one they havent had time to look into yet. In addition, extracurricular activities can help students later on in life when they are in college, applying for a job, or any point in their lives beyond that. The principal has chosen to require students to attend an extracurricular activity, which is not only beneficial to them in many ways, but also to everyone elseÂ when the students go out into the world and spread their gifts and talents.\nOne way that students could be helped by learning an extracurricular activity is that they can meet some new people that they might not have ever met before. Students can become friends with them since they have a bond over the activity that they are both interested in. However, some students are shy and/or have fears of social interactions, which can cause them to avoid these activities, but extracurricular activities can actually help get those timid and quiet students to express themselves through the activity. Sometimes, these students are alone and have no friends, which can lead to them feeling down, as well as anxious; extracurricular activities can help prevent these students from being isolated, and can also help them to relax by eleviating the anxiety that they might feel when they are alone. If students become more extroverted in this manner, then they will feel good about doing an activity that they want to do, which can possibly make them feel better so they are happier and less pessimistic.\nThe additional requirement of an extracurricular activity is opposed by some students who say that it wastes their time and interferes with their schedule that is always packed. Having a packed schedule is not always a good idea because it could physically and mentally stress the human body; a way to vent this stress is through an extracurricular activity where students can focus on what they're passionate about instead of what stresses them. Other students who disagree say that they don't know what type of activity they want to participate in; thanks to the wide variety of choices available, they will most likely find either an activity that matches their interests or one that helps them to learn something new. Another pro is that they can choose an activity such as Homework Club that assists them in getting their work done so they don't have as much to do. If students really enjoy an activity, they may choose to major in that activity in college, consider it as a job, or at least find it useful sometime later in life, which disproves the argument that extracurricular activities won't ever help anyone.\nSome students don't have access to certain materials and items at home and are barely getting by because minorities often get less money than the majority does, which can unfairly deny them the chance to do the activities that they like doing; extracurricular activities are usually held at and/or sponsored by schools that receiveÂ enough money, which gives these underprivileged students a chance to finally participate in extracurricular activities. These minorities are often lonely and neglected, so a mandatory extracurricular activity will help them to feel included in a larger group.\nIn conclusion, I truly believe that it is necessary to add an extracurricular activity to the school curriculum because it can lead to so many good results. Requiring them will lead to students feeling less alone and stressed, as well as finding ways to help reduce that stress and include all students. It will help minority groups to be able to engage in activities that they have previously been unjustly impeded from doing. It will also allow students to find others who are passionate about similar things, which might lead to them becoming friends.Â Lastly, it will help to prepare students for their future, even if the activity they like to do doesn't seem that useful. For these reasons, I agree with the principal's decision to make an extracurricular activity mandatory.",

        "The principal can decide a lot of things, but not decide what a student does before or after school. I disagree with the principal's idea of making all students do one extracurricular activity. First issue is, it extends an already drawn out school day, making the day last an extra hour or two. Also, a student's talent may not represented in a club, therefore making them feel left out. Finally, students may have outside of school routines, or work they must do, and this rule interferes with their routine. This idea is taking away a bit more of a student's free will, thus leading to my argument. I disagree with the idea of making all students participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because it extends an already long school day, could make students feel left out because their talent isn't represented, and can interfere with a students after schoolÂ or before school routine. Now, onto a more in-depth look.\nFirst of all, the school day issue. School can already be long and tiring, so there's no need to make it longer for students. While some may enjoy sports or other extracurricular activities, those who do not are wasting their time by doing an activity they may not enjoy. Students typically only have around 5 hours of free time outside of school. Add an extra two hours and now they have 3 hours, and some of that time will be used to do homework leaving little time to do what they enjoy. This can stress students out and lead to depression, and make them dread going to school because the entire day is eaten up by it. Along with these points, a student may not have a club or activity they fit into, leading me to my second point.\nNext up, students may not have their talents represented in clubs or activities. Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something.\nFinally, it may interfere with a student's before or after school routine. In the morning, most students have a routine they follow. If they have an activity that begins 45 minutes before school, they have to rearrange their whole schedule. This can lead to them losing sleep, not getting a good enough breakfast, and generally under preparedÂ for school. If a student has an after school activity, this can change and shorten their routine. If they get home, do homework, play games for 2 hours, eat dinner, shower, and then go to sleep, an activity can limit these things to less games or enjoyable activities, not as much of a dinner, and the day being taken up by mostly homework. It can cancel their time to relax or have fun, and cause a routine change. It shouldn't be up to the school to choose a students after or before school life, and throw off their entire schedule.\nTo summarize, I disagree with the principal's idea. It lengthens out a long school day, can make students feel left out, and can mess with a student's schedule. It doesn't seem fair for the school to control a student's out of school time. While school is important, it shouldn't be a student's entire life, they need breaks from it. Clubs, activities, and sports are balanced because people who want to be in them join them, not because they have to. Other people can suffer from a student not participating in their activity making it not enjoyable for others. The school shouldn't choose a student's out of school life.",
