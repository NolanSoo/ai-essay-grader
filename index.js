    ESSAY: "Unmasking the Face on Mars\n \n \"Come over here quick!\" As I told my NASA crew members, I told them that I had found something. Hi i'm a scientist at NASA diccusing the face that another scientist thinks it was created by aliens. As i told them they all came and was wondering what I needed them for and if I found clues. \"I think I found parts of the face that is not an aliens.\" states one of the scientist at NASA. We didn't find anything unusual, except that there may be more than one of the faces.\n \n Many of the scientist are starting to wonder if this face was created by aliens. Scientists have tooked camera over and there is no alien monument after all, But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied. The face on mars is located 41 degress north latitude. The camera they had been using had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. They said the aliens marks may have been hidden by haze but some didn't even think that their were aliens marking and said that it is just a natural landform, but then again how could they prove it.\n \n April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time ever. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal photos. Many anxious web surfers were waiting for the first image to appear on their screens. All they got was a natural landform no sign of alien transformation.\n \n Lastly, NASA had many images for web surfer to see. The caption that they had noted underneath was huge rock formation. Which is resembles a human head. It is formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose and mouth. The authors reasoned that it would be a good way t engage and attract the public attentions to Mars.\n \n What the picture was actually showing was the martian equivalent if a mesa or a landform. Which was common around the AMerican West. It reminds many people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idoho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same size as the face on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.\n \n The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.\n \n Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.",

Haha,..nope just a natural landform.\n \n Only a few scientist thought that the face was an artifact, but as soon as NASA heard this the made it a priority to go back and photograph Cydonia once again. Jim Garvin says \"We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" (Paragraph 6) This mean if it was an alien artifact NASA would have made money and benifited from finding this.\n \n However, when Michael Malin went back and photgraphed this again it revealed only a natural landform.(Paragraph 7) Later when others went back again to photograph it they were fortunet enough to get close enough to get a clear picture. (Paragraph 10)\n \n The picture acutally only shows the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.(Paragraph 12) Too bad for all those scientist who thought this was an alien artifact.

    ESSAY: "When the face on Mars was first descovred from a region of the planet called Cydonia first found in 1976, many people thought it might have been created by aliens. However this is not true, the face on this planet is a natural landform. The face is a natural landform because it is equivalent to a Martian mesa, there were no ther objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.\n \n The face on Mars is a mesa. A Martian mesa is commen around the area of Cydonia. The mesa is only seen as a face because it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The shadows give the rock formation the ilolusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.\n \n There were no other objects seen in any of the pictures that had been taken. Michael Malin's team captured an extraordinary picture using the camers's maximum resolution. \"As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size\" Garvin explaned. So if there were any objects in this picture such as airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even a small shack it would have been seen in the pictures.\n \n There was no alien movement detected on Mars. If it was aliens that created this face the camers's would have picked up the movement and captured pictures. On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed a natural landform proving there was no alien movement.\n \n The Face on Mars is a natural landform that looks like a face becasue of the shadows it was formed by. The Face is a natural landform that was not created by aliens because it is equivelant to a Martiam mesa, there were no other objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.",

    ESSAY: "This face landform stucture found on Mars was not made by any living source. I belive nature took its course and it so happened to look like a face. Eyes, nose mouth it looks like a face no doubt about it, but it cannot be stuctured by living substances. Most scientists have been saying that this face was made by aliens, but I have to disagree. It just simply can not.\n \n I belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times. There is basically no evidence that aliens have built this landface.\n \n Well If you still do not belive me and still think aliens have built this landface than I think you are insane because I gave you a bunch of reasons why there is no way and there is no evidence that aliens have built this landface. Everybody should be on my side and say mother nature has built this face, but untill there is prove aliens exist I don't think aliens should be in the topic about this.",

    ESSAY: "The face on Mars is just a natural landform. Their's really no existense of aliens, because theres no proof of them. The face is just a landform that was created with Mars. On Earth we have landforms that look like faces and other things that were created with Earth. There's also no proof that there's life on Mars, becuase there really isn't life on Mars.\n \n The existence of aliens is false, humans and animals are the only life forms out there pretty much. If there were proof of aliens then why arn't they on Earth then? Aliens never made that on Mars, that face was created when Mars was. NASA just used the face to get money, because this face was starred in a Hollywood film, it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store check out lines for 25 years. Then after that they really didn't care for the face anymore. Everyone was not really satisfied with the face on Mars.\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-- landforms common around the American West. Garvin a scientist even says that it reminds him of the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also says \"That's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n As you can see the face was never created or made by aliens. The face was created with mars. In the story, it even says that the landform was basically created with Mars. So in fact there is no existence of aliens and there is no life on Mars.\n \n In the ending of the story, it basically says the face is just a landform, it tells the height and everything about it. They even say that they don't pass over the face that much anymore. So it's just a true fact that the face a landform, they even said it was just a natural land form.",

    ESSAY: "Do you believe that the face on Mars is made by aliens? I know my opinion doesnt matter, what matters is whats real. I know you are also thinking that this is crazy, because we all know aliens do not exist. There is no proof of aliens.\n \n It has to be a natural landform, because in the 12th paragraph Garvin said it reminded him of Most Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. Our universe can create anything, just because something look like it was made does not mean it is. There could of been rocks there, and the dust just blows around them. Making it look like it was made, by something or someone. The very most obvious thing is aliens do not exist, there has been no proof of alien. Even to this day in 2016 there is still no proof of aliens.\n \n In the 3rd paragraph NASA even mentioned it as a \"huge rock formation\" scientist are very smart if there was other such thing that made it, it would have already been discovered. Also the face on Mars was a good way to get attention, like paragraph number 5 said so. The face of Mars turned into a famous pop icon. It was on Hollywood films, all the way to Haunted grocery store check out lines. If people could get the public to think that it was aliens that made the face, it would have maybe become way more popular. Plus most people do not believe in such thing as aliens, if they do not have real proof.\n \n My very last example is , if NASA found out was aliens they would have already told the public. It would be huge for NASA to discover aleins. There is no way they would hide the proof that aliens are real. It would help their budget, if they did discover an ancient alien civilization on mars. As it says in paragraph 6 scientist started hunting for more information. It became a priority for them. All the pictures they took revealed it as a natural landformation as it says in paragraph 7.\n \n There is no way it is related to Aliens. So if someone says that NASA is just hiding it, it would be false. NASA would surely reveal that there is aliens on another planet. Just imagine how much attention they would get if they actually discovered it. They would probably be one of the richest people. It is positive that a face on mars, made by aliens is not real.

    ESSAY: "Now there hasnt been real information on the existence of aliens or any other lifeforms of that kind. Stories behind those creatures are usually made up by many people. We dont have any evidence as to seeing or taking pictures of any aliens or UFO's. So why would aliens be on Mars?\n \n Due to the fact that researchers have identified that the \"Face\" is juast a mesa, I think is safe to say that there are no alien life forms on mars and there never was.\n \n Nasa has very good cameras that are way better than the ones in 1976. They can zoom in way more and take 3-D images as well. if there were aliens living on there you would be able to see UFO's and a whole lot of aliens on the planet. And if there were Egyptioan style pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see them to. The \"Face\" is a martian equivalent to a butte or mesa as scientifically proven by scientist.\n \n Another reason as to why the mesa on mars is a landform and not some alien made artifact is that in the article it said that there were shadowns giving off the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. \"Its a good way to enage the public and attract attention to mars\", as said in the story. Also making the Face a pop icon also would make more people think that there really is life on mars without any real evidence. The face appeared on movies and magazines, which made more and more people follow this trend of life on mars.\n \n The final reason as to why the object on mars is just a landform and not an alien made thing is that on a cloudy, wispy day, the photo was taken. Making it seem like the aliens did it on purpose. But, scientist took the photo again on a less cloudier day and found out that is was just a landfrom after all. when they shot it with their better camera, it showed that is was just made by mars just like earth makes its own lanforms sometimes. So it seems as though technology from back then just wasnt updated enough to get the job done.\n \n Ultimately, the reason that evryone thought that there were life on mars is because technology wasnt as evolutionized as it was in 2001 compared to 1976. With the technology today, we would be able to find out right away if there were actually life on mars. So in conclusion, there is not life on mars and there never was.",

The picture shows a Martian like butte or mesa.\n \n After all the research Garvin says, \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" By saying that its pretty clear that is was any of what you may be thinking. Before all the research I though it was an alian or a creture too . Now there is nothing to worry about is just a natural landform just like Earth have some too.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as \"The Face on Mars.\" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.\n \n Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.\n \n On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.\n \n Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was. Now NASA had proved that this brilliant \"face\" was only a landform.\n \n NASA did endless amounts of research in hopes of finding evidence of martian life, so why would they hide something like that? Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform. The research NASA has put into may not have given them the results they wanted, but it may later benefit them in finding life on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist I had to discusss the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation of the face on Mars giving the mosts reasonable and lucid -something clearly shown- ideas. There is many reasons why this \"face\" was not made by aliens. As a scientist I had to explain some evidence that would show what this \"face\" is classified as. Also I had to show the main ideaology on these speculations or conspiracies that \"know\" what NASA is doing. My main job as scientist is to observe, study, and explain many mysteries but I had to use clearly expressed qualifications for the face to be created by aliens.\n \n For my first reasoning on this topic I had to discuss this person how this landform is classified as mesa or butte which occurs normally in many environments. Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, \"It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\" showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!\n \n After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.\n \n Another type of reasoning this \"face\" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this \"face\" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the \"face,\" shows that the \"face\" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a \"face\" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.\n \n Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.\n \n So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the \"face\" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the \"face\" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "The \"face on mars\" is not a real face. The face is a mesa or butte that looks like the ones found in the American west. It looks like a face by the shadows that form on it. The camera that found the \"face on mars\" was old and later a new one took a picture that can clearly see the surface. The new camera cannot be argued with because it is the latest and clearest. Also why would NASA try to hide the fact that there was aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them alot.\n \n The mesa or butte on mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kindof sounds dumb. If you think about it in the way i do it would be lke an alien race looks down on our planet saw a mesa that looked like a face and thought we knew he was there and wanted look at him/her/it.\n \n Also dont you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the \"face\" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock.\n \n If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they was going to wait for a clear day too so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine,and the image is completely real too.\n \n If ther was really aliens on mars it would benefit them alot. Think about it why woul NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollors to study them. Also if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way,because what if they had technolligy we didn't wouldnt we already have it? If there were aliens wouldnt they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war.\n \n The \"face on mars\" is totally fake. Now that ive bestowed upon you my knowledge maybe you can pass it on to other conspiracy theorists. Then maybe the \"face on mars\" thing wil finally blow over. Next time something like this happens you can probably look into that further too. Also maybe just maybe conspiracy theorists might come to an end.",

They could've ruled us by now. The Face is a natural landform on Mars.\n \n To prove that this was not caused by aliens, NASA reported,\" Huge rock formation which resembles a human head that is formed by shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It is all just an illusion.

    ESSAY: "This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.\n \n The only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says \"Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all\". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?\n \n Scientists say that in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West\". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.\n \n But, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. \" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze\". So right now it shows that there could be a possibility that aliens could have made the Face. This one piece of evidence could be the evidence they are looking for.\n \n In conclusion, no one knows what made this interesting Face on Mars. But we do have a lot of information about what could have made it if it wasnt aliens. When we don't have a lot of information here, we can not really think what this Face was made by.

So we decide to send the picture back to NASA to see what they had to say about it. There replies where so shocking to us we could not belive it they that the face had been created by aliens.\n \n Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this.\n \n Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this.

    ESSAY: "If I were a scientist at NASA and I was disucussing the Face with someone who doesn't think the Face was just landformation I would say, it is because of what other scientist in NASA believe it was a landformation that looked like a real human face.\n \n The Face was just something formed by the planet because the artical says, \"huge rock formation... which resemles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Which means that is was just a rock that was formed a different way to look like it was a face. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but there were more scientist to prove them wrong. Another piece of evidence was when they were taking pictures Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. This evidence goes with my argument because if it was some type of alien siglnal the camera would of picked it up and they would of seen what it really was, but they didn't all they saw was a landform like the ones around American West.\n \n In conclution it was not an alien signal, or artifact, it was just a piece of land formed differently. Now you all know it wasn't from aliens. All it was, was an illusion that looked like a real human face with a nose, eyes, and more. Don't assume everything on other planets are always from aliens because for now we don't have proof aliens exist.",

    ESSAY: "The fae on mars is just another landform. I think this becasue there are land forms that form exactly like it on earth, and why would the government let us see pictures of it if it was an artifact from some alien civilization.\n \n The face on mars is just a messa. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" So infact it is not an artifact of a alien civilization because there are landforms just like it on earth from domes of lava that take the shape of an isolated mesa.\n \n If this was an actuallly conspirasy than why is it not being hidden from us. \"Although few scitests believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the REad Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.\" They did not take more pictures becasue they believed that there was some kind of alien artifact, they took mare pictures because the pictures they had from before were eighteen years old. So things on mars could have changed during those eighteen years.\n \n After all of the proving that it was not an alien artifact there were still some skeptics. \"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze.\" Then NASA took more pictures on a clear sunny day and used a really high pixalization to show people that if there were peryamids on mars they would be able to see them in the picture.\n \n This just shows to prove that the face on mars is just in fact a landformation and not an alien artifact. NASA has proved many times again and again that this mestry face is not mare that just a mesa that formed on mars. Skeptics will keep tring to prove NASA wrong but there is not another logical explainization than the Face just being a landform on mars.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars is not what everyone thinks it is. Hollywood shows, magazines, and radio talk shows can exaggerate to make the landform sound like more than what it truly is. As a NASA scientist, I believe that you should know exactly what this historic landmark is, so you know the correct story for years to come.\n \n First, you never know what publicity will do with the next big story. Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. \"Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.\n \n To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. \"....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.\" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.\n \n In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",

    ESSAY: "Why do you believe the face was created by aliens? When looking at this image, you can think about that at first but if you believe it immediately, then there is something wrong about that. I will explain to you why the face was not created by aliens though i will also explain why someone may believe that.\n \n The face is an image we found in 2001 that was taken by our Viking 1 spacecraft that was circling the Mars. The face is an area of land on Mars that has the illusion of a face. The illusion of the face comes from the shadows making the land look like it has a nose, eyes, and a mouth that resembles a human face. It was a surprise for most people here at NASA but we didn't believe it was alien works immediately because we didn't have any real evidence of it. It just so happened to be a patch of land that looked like a face.\n \n We couldn't say it was made by aliens because we needed proof of that and we haven't studied Mars' enough to prove that aliens made the face. We know Mars is similar to Earth but it's still a different planet in our solar system. Although we hoped it might've been an alien civilization, we studied the face more and it was simply a landform similar to a mesa or butte of our world.\n \n Even though we know it was just a landform, there are reasons we could see people saying it might've been made by aliens. We know Mars is able to sustain life because of it's conditions and there has been few deposits of water found there, but we have never found an actual living species on the planet itself. We as humans still don't know if aliens live on Mars or if aliens from other worlds exist at all. Many people believe there are aliens from other planets and some don't really care about the subject at all but it is possible that there's life on other planets.\n \n Because we haven't figured out if Mars has life, people believe the strange and convinient findings on Mars (like the face) are works of alien beings. Although we have confirmed the face was not a work of aliens, we still don't know if aliens exist. We can conclude that the face is not the work of aliens but there just might be unearthly beings on our neighboring planet, Mars. Before we can confirm there are alien beings on Mars, we would need evidence to explain they do exist at all. But we can conclude, the face is not made by aliens.",

According to the text it states,\"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible.

Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too.

    ESSAY: "Have you ever wanted to be apart of NASA or a scientist? Scientist get to explore many parts of the world, even outer space. Have you ever wanted to travel to Mars known as the, \"Red Planet?\" Mars has a long history, however some NASA scientists say that in 1967 they saw a face on Mars and some people thought that aliens created it.\n \n Twenty-Five years ago from this date May 24, 2001 a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars taking pictures of possible landings for the sister ship named Viking 2. As the spacecraft was circling around the planet Mars, it saw something very odd which was, shadowy likeness of a human face with and enorumous head nearly two miles from the end it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on the red planet called Cydoina. Soon scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, however this one had unsusual shadows which made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n As NASA looks at the images the caption said \"huge rock formation.\" The Mars then started to reveal images of a face such as the, eyes, nose, and mouth. Mars has now became a famous planet. The planet Mars has starred in Hollwood flims, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery story checkout line.\n \n The agurment now is weither or not the face was made by aliens and the answer is NO. In passage seven, it says, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orgional Viking photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landfrom. There was NO alien monument after all.\n \n I believe if I was in the NASA or if I were a scientist I would use passage seven to back my answer up. It gives all the details about why the aliens did not make the face on the planet Mars. Even though everyone would not be satisfied with my agurement, I now have proof that it was not created by aliens.",

    ESSAY: "Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.\n \n First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people.\n \n Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.\n \n Of course, people still weren't satisfied. Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face. After extensively studying the pictures, Jim Garvin states that it \"is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\". He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West. The Face is just a regular landform.\n \n In conclusion, that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Almost 30 years of research went by until they came to their conclusion. The Face is only a meer mesa. It was created naturally, and not by aliens. No one can argue with facts!",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist of NASA, I can say that \"The Face\" is in fact a landform. We made this conclusion when we first snapped a picture 10x faster of the face, we also took a second look and picture, and it has simalarites like a natural landform from the Snake River Plain of Idaho on Earth. But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory.\n \n In 1998 on April 5, for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. A picture was captured 10x better than the orginal viking photos. they were later posted on a website for the public to see but for the people who thought it was a sign of life on Mars, they were wrong. Scientist's said it was just a natural landform.\n \n For the second time, the scientist could yet again reach Cydonia once again to turn their conspiracy theory to fact. Others back on Earth said it was too windy and it made the clouds affect the picture. This time researchers used a maximum resolution camera to prove the theorists wrong. Yet again Garvin said, \" If there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were.\"\n \n Scientist said that the \"face\" was equivalent to a butte or mesa. They made this staement because there is something similar to it on Earth in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These are found around the American West. Garvin said, \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the \"Face on Mars.\"\n \n On the other side of things, there were many conspiracy theorists that questioned NASA's claim. Everyone wasn't satisfied with the pictures that were first taken people said it was during a cloudy season, that's why there was another trip with more advanced equipment. They also stated that the camera on board had to go through the clouds and dust to see the face so the picture couldn't been shown clearly. Another claim they made is that since there were wispy clouds the alien markings could be hidden in the haze and scientists just didn't look hard enough.\n \n In conclusion we have the facts that we need to prove that \" The Face\" is just a natural landform. We have provided the public with two pictures. Plus we also made observations that it looked like a landform from here on Earth. As NASA, we would like to see the conspiracy theorists prove us wrong then they could state the facts for once.",

    ESSAY: "So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.\n \n My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.\n \n My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?\n \n The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. \"It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Garvin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.\" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.\n \n My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?\n \n This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.",

    ESSAY: "Many people, including nasa, believe that \" the Face\" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.\n \n First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.\n \n Secondly, the only reason it \"has\" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.\n \n Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.\n \n Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.\n \n Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",

    ESSAY: "Is There Really a Face on Mars???\n \n The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).\n \n When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.\n \n Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).\n \n Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.",

    ESSAY: "I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there.

    ESSAY: "The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.\n \n The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.\n \n Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.\n \n The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",

Very few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian Messa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" However, people thought it was a real face. When the picture went online or on TV, people thought it was \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Even though some people are defenders of NASA, we still shouldn't give them money to see if there is an actual ancient civilization. If we do we could possibly be putting that money to waste. We should think about if the pictures are real or if they were photoshopped.\n \n However, NASA has confirmed it a messa. Which is a natural landform. Since it is windy or cloudy on Mars this messa could have been pushed around to make it look like a face. Even though we got pictures we would still be able to see things like airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks. We could have actually seen those on the ground. NASA dosen't even pass over the face that often. In contrast, we would not be able to get much information on it. So we should not even worry about how to figure out what it is.\n \n Therefore, when scientists Jim Garvin says it reminds him of \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" we should think about how is he right. When a scientists says something big and important we are listening and comparing something on Earth to Mars means that it could have been caused by erosion. Even though we are just getting pictures of it isn't enough. We could have better pictures now then they did back then. In conclusion, erosion and plains on earth come naturally. We have no idea what that could be made of it could be made of, sand for all we now.\n \n Therefore, we may have confirmed pictures it is a face. But do we have pictures that it is not just darker sand. The face could be anything on Mars. Because their pictures confirmed it a messa, it is a natural landform. In contrast, it formed naturally. Just like how it looks like Middle Butte in Idaho. Which was formed naturally. If this gets people saying that their could be life on Mars we probably would have found it by now.\n \n All in all, if the face was real then why don't we have more advanced pictures of it. NASA only has older pictures of this so called \"Face\", it looks like a natural landform in Idaho. So next time NASA gets people crazy about another ancient alien civilzation, think about how they need to prove it.",

    ESSAY: "Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.\n \n First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?\n \n NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.\n \n If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.\n \n Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",

    ESSAY: "I know this wasn't created by aliens in many ways. It is just a naturally created landform that looks like face. If it was created by aliens then NASA would benefit from discovering life on a different planet, so that shows that everyone in NASA is sad that we didn't find life. Landforms created from nature shouldn't be lied about just to get attention. That is why we don't tell other people a lie when it is just a landfrom like the Grand Canyon. Here are also reasons how I know it wasn't created by aliens.\n \n Some rock formations on Earth are created by wind chipping off peices until one day the rocks are completely gone. We didn't have any control of the winds that created the rock formations, so that shows that nothing living created it. Around the face is other landforms that were created the same way the Face was made. The Face is the only one that people pay attention to becuase it looks like a face, but if you look at the entire picture you can see that other landforms are there that might not look like a face, but they show that landforms are created naturally there.\n \n These examples show us that these landforms were not created by aliens, but by the weather that accurs there. That is why we shouldn't lie just to get attention and make everybody believe something that isn't real. This concludes that the Face was only created by weather like the landforms on Earth.",

    ESSAY: "I know people think the face on Mars is something that was created by some kind of life, but really it is not. This is acually just a landform. The face was found in the region of the red planet called Cydonia. It is very hard for NASA to get the picture because they have to angle the satalite just right. I am not trying to be pestimistic but, NASA has seen landforms on Mars before and the article says,\"the mouth, nose, and eyes are allusions caused by shadows\". The facts just dose not add up to their being life on Mars.\n \n This face is just a landform. There are many ways this landform could have happend. For example, a duststorm, astroids crashing on the planet, or underground volcanos. These are all examples of how the face could have been created. The article says it was caused by butte or mesa. Time for everyone to come up with a new theory!\n \n This face was found in the area Cydonia. One day the aircraft Viking 1 was circaling the plant and found the face. Could you imagine the scientist face when the aircraft reported it back. A few days later they released it to the public. Lots of people were confinced that it was caused by some kind of lifeform, but really it was not.\n \n It was hard work for NASA to get the picture because they had to rotate the aircraft at 30 degrees. This was not easy because if they went to far Nasa would miss the face. If they did not go all the way around Nasa would still miss it . It had to be perfect. It could have been 29 degrees, one of, but it did not matter it would still miss it. It had to be perfect. NASA finnaly got the picture and proved that there was no lifeform.\n \n The nose, mouth, and eyes are caused by shadow illusions. They might have been formed by astroids crashing there, but are most likely shadow illusions. These illusions are caused when the Mars acsis are tillted a certain way and the sun hits it. This is most likly how the shadow allusion happened. This is what scientist says caused the illusion.\n \n In conclusion there were many ways for this landform to happen. Do not think this was caused by some kind of life form because there is not enough proff. There are many ways this could have been formed. For example. A dust storm, or underground volcano the list goes on. It may never be solved what caused it. Just face it it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars is a very mysterious thing, but it's only been caught on camera, clearly, once, but that was in the 1970s. The cameras in 1976 were not very clear, as you see they have a 43 meter span per pixel, which makes the picture a whole lot more blurry. Even though it's been seen all over the world as an unknown landform or an alien artifact, the evidence has been seen through, and the face, is, well, not really a face at all.\n \n The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars. Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001. Yet the picture doesn't depict an Egyption face staring back at you, but a standard, normal, everyday, Mars mesa. The pictures of the face in 1998 showed clearly that the face wasn't quite a face, with a camera 10 times sharper than the original Viking camera, yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars. Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time. The cameras' span was 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the Viking's 46 meters per pixel, and the planet of Mars was as clear as the eye could see at that time, but there was no unnatural objects to be seen. Yes, it is hard to prove that the famous mesa isn't man-made, you would have to be on the planet to do that, yet the facts and research is all here and it's time to let go.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars has been very iconic on what it has done to the people, and the world as a whole. It's been analyzed and researched over, over, and over again. And it all comes down to the cold hard facts, which all points to the intriging rock of 1976 of being just a rock formation that was, well, lets just say, for now... misunderstood.",

Many people like to make theories about subjects but nobody knows about the real information. Not unless we share it to the public, we will not share things we want to hide from everyone. The picture was not made by aliens and we explain why it is just a natural landform.\n \n If I were to be a scientist at NASA I would tell the person that the Face is just a natural landform. There are many conspiracy theorists that claim we are trying to hide something, such as saying aliens made the Face. In the article it says\n \n \" evidence that NASA would rather hide \" , that is correct. If the aliens did make it then we wouldn't have showed the public the photos. We would want to keep it out of newspapers, magazine, tv shows, and movies.\n \n NASA would also never want lots of people to see the picture of the Face if they were to hid something. We would make the picture an enigma to the citizens of the world. Scientist in NASA have studied these for years and they have all the information. Also in the third paragraph in the article it tells us that there are some shadows that make the the Face get the illusion of having eyes and a nose. The third paragraph says \" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. \" which is telling us that they want people to know more about Mars so we obvisouly wouldn't be showing the pictures if the aliens made it.\n \n Although there were few scientist that believed the Face was an alien artifact, in paragraph seven it says\n \n \" ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. \" , NASA scientist take their jobs very serious. People continued to say the Face markings were made from aliens but the NASA scientist said it was just a natural landform and some of the pictures were made from the shadows. On April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer in Cydonia, Malin's team got an \" extraordinary \" picture of the Face because many people such as the theorists said maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.\n \n In the second paragraph NASA was excited to see if the Face was something sensational and the article says \" Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. \" the only thing that made this one stand out was it has shadows that give it facial features such as a nose, eyes and a mouth. NASA soon showed the picture for all the people to see with a caption telling them what it was. NASA would not show the picture and make up something if the Face was really created by aliens.\n \n In the very last paragraph the article tells us what the picture actually shows from what the scientist at NASA have gathered. Paragraph twelve says \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. \". The scientist are telling us that the Face is just a landform, as a NASA scientist there is a lot of information about the Face and it was not made by aliens.

I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.\n \n First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.\n \n Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts.

Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.\n \n Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there.

    ESSAY: "For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, \"aliens\" have done so.\n \n In 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.\n \n To conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform. But in reality, no one has the facts to prove that an alien life-form had created this landform. No one has the facts to prove there are alien civilizations on Mars. I only say this because there has not yet been facts, or any information involving alien-life forms or ancient civilizations on mars. Maybe in the future, there will be signs of some type of life-form on Mars, or very odd, peculiar objects that we may find somewhat weird, or, out of the ordinary.

    ESSAY: "I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the \"face\" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.\n \n The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.\n \n Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing.

You can't see all the details.\" At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural.\n \n This Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientists have even compared it to buttes and mesas here on Earth. An example of this comparison was by Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. He said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho stating, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\" Also, Mars is known for being a very dusty and rocky planet. It would be very easy for the formations of Mars to erode together and make such a landform as this.\n \n In addition to it just being a natural landform, there is absolutely no evidence of life near this area or anywhere else. This goes to show that it can't be man/ alien made. The NASA scientists, are using the highest quality cameras in technology today. They zoom in to 1.56 meters per pixel, allowing them to see every little detail. After doing this they found no shelter, no water, no life showing any forms of a civilization. There has never been any life, outside of maybe bacteria, found on Mars, and even if there was, NASA would quadruple their funds after that kind of discovery giving them no reason to hide it.\n \n The Face of Mars is simply a natural landform similar to a butte or mesa similar to those on Earth, with no alien interaction.

    ESSAY: "In the Story \"Unmasking the Face on Mars.\" The face on mars has apparently been founded in 1976, NASA claimed the the face was formed by a alien, Here is were I come in, The world had made a bunch of movies including aliens from mars, Mars, for hundreds maybe thousands of years have been the 'Aliens home'. Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Â“MalinÂ’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameraÂ’s absolute maximum resolution.Â”\n \n That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.\n \n Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â”\n \n This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. Â“huge rock formation....\" It basically says that the rock is a formation \".......giving the illusion......\" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth. I clearly gives out that opinion that if you put it together you get \"A huge rock formations giving the illusion.........\" and so on.\n \n I also think that The 'face' Is just a rock the looks like a face, clearly I stated that. Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...\"over time it transformed .....\" in the text... \"Huge rock FORMation.\" It is just a rock thats looks like a face, and just because it's on mars don't mean a thing.",

    ESSAY: "Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a \"shadowy likeness of a human face\". Shadows on the object give \"the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.\n \n In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.\n \n The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.",

    ESSAY: "There are a variety of perspectives and opinions related to the Face on Mars. Many say that it's simply a lava dome, or that it could just be a strange rock molded in such a way where it may appear to be a face. However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.\n \n This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures. They thought of many different possibilities to why this was formed in a way that reminded us of an Egyptian Pharaoh such as the possibility of the camera's angle, the shadows covering it. Basically we thought of everything minus the chance that it may have been the works of such \"aliens\".\n \n Aliens have been the illogical reasoning to many things we find on the various assortments of planets so hearing that this recent discovery was blamed on aliens isn't very shocking. We spent a few days deciding whether or not to show the images captured to the public, but in the end we decided to do so. The Face on Mars instantly became a well-known subject all over the world things such as movies, magazines, and even radio and tv talk shows all spoke of the mysterious Face on Mars. Many considered this discovery as the new pop icon. During this there were many conspiracy theorists who began to state that the Face on Mars was the work of aliens. However that's the thing, there are no statistical facts simply a load of different conspiracies made from people who strongly believe in such things! Considering there is lack of proof on even the stance that aliens are real the \"case\" was never thoroughly thought through.\n \n There can be various reasonings and opinions about the Face on Mars and though they may be very amusing or interesting to hear, the reality of it is really that it is simply an isolated lava dome. This isn't the first time that natural landforms have represented such things as faces or even common artifacts. There is still research going on about what's casuing these strange formations, but you can be sure that it's not the work of aliens.",

Some conspiracy theorists believe that a face found on Mars from a photo taken by Viking 1 - a Mars Global surveyor -\n \n was created by aliens who lived on the planet over 300 billion years ago. NASA released information and a picture about the 'Face on Mars,' to the media, with the caption, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head.\" The face believed to be found on Mars is nothing less then a rock formation, and was not created by aliens.\n \n Mission controller Garvin says, \"It's not easy to target Cydonia.\" He also noted that his crew does not pass over the Face very often. This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years. Over time the wind and atmosphere has shaped the rock into the form of what looks to be a Face.\n \n NASA leaked evidence about the Face on Mars when they unveiled the image for the public and media to see, stating clearly that the Face was formed by, \"shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see the image on a JPL website, the text in fact quoted, \"It was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n The people that do believe that there was alien life on Mars, think that the aliens markings were hidden by haze, and believe the Face is \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Contarary to what skeptics and other theorists think, there is no actual piece of true evidence discovered by NASA to prove otherwise.\n \n Garvin and his team said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyarmids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" So this actual NASA evidence that the mysterious \"Face\" found on Mars was nothing but a simple landform.\n \n The NASA Space Program has been around for decades. NASA has not yet found evidence to consider the Face on Mars was alien artifacts. Even with NASA's best cameras, there just isn't a theoretical proven fact that this could have become an artifact from ancient aliens.

On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia.\n \n Back at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figures it was just another Matian mesa, around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.\n \n Some might believe that the so called \"alien artifact\" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth.\" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they \"photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it.\" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.\n \n As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the \"camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,\" and according to skeptics, \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that \" It's not easy to target Cydonia,\" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is \"bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.\n \n In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too.

These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976.

The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big.

I've thought about it and I have read this story called \"Unmasking The Face on Mars\" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.\n \n When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption \"...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth.\" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This \"face\" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.\n \n Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage \"It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.\n \n Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that \"the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.\"(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.\n \n After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars\" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all.",

    ESSAY: "The face on mars is not created by aliens this is a natural landform on earth there already were landforms that were created. We can't say aliens made those too. Such as vocanoes, rivers, and mountains we also couldn't say we built those because we didn't. If aliens really did build the face on mars how come their isn't any proof anything was on the planet? If there was any form of a living species you would have at least seen Egyptian- style pyramids or even small shacks.\n \n Mars is a planet that is know for having rocks on it, there is a possibility that this is just a huge rock that was carved into the planet already or the planet it's self got either hit by and astroid or had been forming it's self in some way. Aliens could'nt have build the face they would've needed soem short of unground passege or even shelter's, none of these things were found when we discoverd the face. We get the picture looks blurry btu even with zooming in you can't see any such thing as if there was an alien.\n \n Scientist has studied the photos the astronots had brought home we saw their were may rocks this could have been a mistake. How would an alien know what a human face looks like anyways? By our understand we could be looking at it and imageing it's a face when really it's just a rock that was formed to look like a humans head.\n \n April 5, 1998 when mars Global Surveyor flew oven the face he snapped pictures ten times sharper then the original Viking photos. Thousands of people anxious to have the photo appear on JPL web site by yet still came out with saying that it was just an natural landform. People were not satisfied, this bring's me back to the point were it was just our imagination maybe we're lookingat it wrong it's really meant to look like one thing but were making it look like another.\n \n We belive that if aliens really did make this face how come their wasn't any type of form in which we can tell their was any type of life form living on mars? Landscapes are usual to see on planest and this was one of them. If there was any type of life form i think Michale Malin would have already taken pictures of them if he had seen anything. He didn't which means this face was actually a natural landform.",

    ESSAY: "Do you think the Face on Mars is real? The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. If there was something that made this, they would leave tracks. But there's nothing.\n \n The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. Scientist says it's a \"mesa.\" Which is common in Mars in Cydonia. It also said that NASA said \"a huge rock formation which forms a head, eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" So everything is made out of bunch of rocks. Michel Malin and his Orbiter snapped the picture ten time bigger than the original picture in 1998. So then it revealed a \" natural landform.\" Theres nothing special about. It's was just land. Later on, Malin's team did a second picture but bigger in 2001. Gavin said there were other objects like shack, airplanes, pyramids, etc. They were all made natural. Also, in Earth, there are many landfroms that looks like things. Like Middle Butte in the Snake River. And it is almost the same size as the Face on Mars.\n \n Just because it's on Mars doesn't mean it made by aliens. It's made out of natural. Sometimes strange objects appear around the Earth. Thats because it's normal to the us and enviroment. It's just a natural form. Its just the lack of conspiracy theorist.",

    ESSAY: "The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.\n \n The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of \"The Red Planet\" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.\n \n The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. \" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken.\" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.\n \n Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.\n \n Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity\n \n My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa. The mesa on the planet is only a natural landform that happens to look like a face. Nothing more and nothing less.",

Lastly, their camera would have caught any glimpse of alien markings. These statements are valid because looking at the evidence provided it gives you more facts that any skeptic could.\n \n The passage states that the Face is just the shadow of where the camera was, then creating the affect of the eyes, nose, and mouth that you see in the pictures.

That is not true because in paragraph 11 they state that they can make a pixel 3 times its size.

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1 snapped a photo of what looked to be a Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA released the picture to the public. The \"Face on Mars\" became a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people still believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is the work of aliens. I believe the \"Face on Mars\" is not the work of aliens, but a natural landform.\n \n The article gives good evidence that the \"Face on Mars\" is just another weird natural landform on Mars. In paragraph 5, conspiracy theorists claim the \"Face on Mars\" is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide. In paragraph 3, NASA unveiled the image for all to see in 1976. The caption noted, \"a huge rock formation...which resembles the shape of a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars; which it certainly did just that. The authors of the article wanted to attract attention towards Mars and NASA even claimed that it was a huge rock formation in the caption. Later, stating that shadows gave the huge rock formation the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper and clearer than the original Viking photos. The picture taken in April of 1998, would most likely not have shadows to give illusions of the face, nose, and mouth. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. NASA again stating and proving that the \"Face on Mars\" was just another out of place natural landform on Mars. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Here again we can see NASA trying to prove that the \"Face on Mars\" in still just a weird natural landform on Mars. Someone who stills believes that the \"Face on Mars\" is the work of aliens might say something like this. The \"Face on Mars\" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim. However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001. The photo taken in April 2001, the weather was perfect-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The photo taken that year still looks like a natural landform on Mars.\n \n The excellent reasons stated above prove yet again that the so called \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural landform.

There are also lots of different holes around the landform which means more have must have been formed close by the landform. Also im sure if there was someone or something on Mars when this happened NASA would have saw. The NASA also had said that \"There was no alien monument after all.\" Which means that there must not had have been aliens on Mars after all. So the landform had to just be a natural landform. I honestly don't even think that aliens are even smart enough to know excatly how to prcocess this landform. The landform doesn't look done with any kind of tool or anything so therefore I think that yes the sculpture is a natural landform even though that's kind of weird & the article actually shows that as the years go by the landform starts to form even more.

When our Viking 1 was scanning the planet to find a safe place for the next space craft to land, Viking 2, Viking 1 suddenly \"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" The scientists at first, were excited, but then we realized that it was probably a common Martian mesa. We just assumed that \"this one had unusual shadows.\" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.\n \n Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.\n \n Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was \"winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.\n \n Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a \"cloudless summer day.\" \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,\" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution.

So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin stated.

    ESSAY: "Why does NASA consider the \"Face of Mars\" to be a natural landform? They claim that the \"face\" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.\n \n Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed \"haze\" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.\n \n In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called \"alien face.\" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the \"alien face\" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.\n \n On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure \"resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face of Mars\" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",

When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.\n \n Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up. Landforms can have all kinds of shapes and the face of Mars just has a very unique shape. In conclusion, the face of Mars is just a odd shaped Butte.",

    ESSAY: "Do aliens really exist and are they capable of doing something like this? I don't think they could but if they were capable of doing something like this. We will need some proof to stand with this. There is 3 reasons why this is just a natural landform. They can just be like any landform on earth, a face like this can happen anywhere else, and if you believe in aliens are they really capable of doing something like this?\n \n The first reason why this is just a natural landform is because it can also happen on earth. For example, this can happen upon natural sources. Such eratation and it can just be a mesa. Another example is, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough round Cydonia\"(2). If this is common than most likely it wouldn't be made by any alien. My last example for this is, most landforms have ways it can look. The landforms can happen anywhere and that wouldnt mean it was caused by an alien. If something like this happened on earth most people would think it was caused by natural thigs like the weather.\n \n My second reason is that things can happen anywhere. For example, another planet my have this but that doesnt mean an alien went and left it there so we could find it. If an alien did this we would be able to find something almost the same as this face. Another example is, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars\"(5). This can be true but if it was an alien wouldnt they do a face they new or reconized. Lastly, in the passage it states that \"There was no alien monument after all\". The picture clearly showed a landform not an alien made monument. In conclusion, things like this can happen in different forms but nobody has proven it was made by an alien.\n \n My last reason for why this is not an alien made monument is because there is no proof that aliens made it. For example, have aliens been proven to exist. No proof was every made that aliens exist in the planet mars. Secondly, how could they build such a thing. if aliens built it than there must be a great amount of them that we did not know about. Lastly, if aliens aready built a Face on Mars why can't they do the same thing on Earth. there is no explanation of they wouldn't be able to do this. In order for the aliens to make something like this that would mean they are capable of this and more but they still haven't been proven to exist.\n \n In conclusion, the face could have been made by something other than aliens. The three reasons explaining why it couldn't have been aliens is it could have been done by nature, it can happen somewhere else, and are aliens capable of this. This can prove that aliens didnt build it, that it could have been made by different things.",

    ESSAY: "The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.\n \n There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.\n \n If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.\n \n They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.\n \n While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.",

    ESSAY: "I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform. It may look like a face but it is really not. What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away. So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad. It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.",

As a scientist we are constantly getting information from people about their thoughts on the Face on Mars. We get many suggestions, such as the face being created by aliens. Well as a scientist I'm here to tell you it was not created by aliens.\n \n This face on Mars was not created by aliens, but was created by nature itself. The Face on Mars is a natural landform. I know this because as a scientist of NASA we believe this face is just a huge rock formation. This rock resembles a human head. The human head formed by shadows, giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and lastly a mouth. Many authors that have researched on this topic believe it will attract more attention to planet Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars has became a very big deal. It has played a role in movies, showed up in magazine articles, and has been a topic on radio talk shows. Many people have come to conclusion that NASA would rather hid information about this such thing. But NASA just wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\n \n Many people still believe that this artifact came for aliens, but few scientist and have come to believe this is true. NASA takes pictures of the Face on Mars but many aren't satisfied by the quality of the pictures. As a scientist at NASA it is very challenging to capture a good photo because this face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude. This means that the camera has to peer through many wispy clouds to catch the face.\n \n We scientist at NASA have come to conclusion that this Face on Mars isn't created by aliens because of those reasons. Although many others may disagree and believe NASA is hiding information on this artifact. As a scientist that works for NASA, we will continue to look more into this specific topic and hopefully be able to know for a fact that this is created by landform and not aliens.",

According to the text, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,\" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.\n \n Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said \"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars, is it really what NASA says it is? The Face on Mars is really what they say it is;a face on Mars. Most belivers in the alien world believe that aliens did do it, while most scientist do not. I am a scientist at NASA working on the \"project\" and most scientist believe that it was just a giant mesa or a \"mountain\" or something that was formed by natural effect.\n \n I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that. In April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia, for the first time ever, and snapped a very \"sharp\" picture of the \"site'.\n \n Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.\n \n The belivers in aliens were still not satiisfied on the image they had seen on the internet due to the weather that day. Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the \"reasearchers\" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.\n \n After they had gotten the second picture they \"blew it up\" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids. The picture acutally showed that it is the, Martian equivalent, size of a buttle or (a. k. a. a mesa) which are landforms most commonly made by nature in the American West.\n \n \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Gavin. \"Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n I hope this has convienced you to believe that the picture is real and that aliens did not build it and that the pictures and people that have spoken told you that it is just a natural landform that was created by \"mother-nature.",

There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.\n \n After studying the \"face\" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the \"face\" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the \"face\". There are many other theories of what the for may be.\n \n I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the \"alien head\" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the \"face\" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the \"face\" was real, but can you always trust magazines.

    ESSAY: "Twenty-five years ago a photo was taken of a natural landform that appears to look like a face. Many people will argue that it isn't a natural landform but, more of an alien artifact. While the two sides still don't see eye to eye they both have evidence that could support their belief.\n \n While, some people think that the face on Mars is \"bona-fide evidence\" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was \"important to the taxpayers\" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.\n \n So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.\n \n While NASA hasn't changed there opinion because it is in fact just a landform. Many people still want good proof that it could quite possibly be acient civilization. So, they prepared to send up another. This time they sent it up on a cloudless summer day so that no-one could argue that the weather affected the pictures. NASA was right again. This time they took up a camera that zoomed in the structure and it didn't show anything new that would have meant that there has ever been any life there.\n \n All together, these facts prove that it is just a landform. A scientist named Garvin was quoted saying \"That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The face is indeed just like a landform that we have here on Earth. Although the other side of this long running debate did have some evidence that might have made NASA think twice, there is still more proof that it is a landform.",

    ESSAY: "Face The Landform?\n \n Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.\n \n First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that \"face\" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.\n \n After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.\n \n Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.\n \n So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.",

    ESSAY: "In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the \"Face on Mars\". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.\n \n When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that \"the Face\" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that \"the Face\" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.\n \n Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture \"huge rock formation...\" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of \"the Face\". The articles states the the image was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\". This image proved that \"the Face\" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph \"on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look\". It also says \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says \"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West\". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.\n \n The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that \"the Face\" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars. Who knows?",

However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.\n \n First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.\n \n Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,\" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.\n \n Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,\" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Also, paragraph twelve states,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West.\" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.\n \n In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",

    ESSAY: "Mesa on Mars\n \n Who or what created this \"face\" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say \"the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This \"face\" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.\n \n To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it states, \"...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos.\" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...\" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.\n \n Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this \"face\" for what it is?\n \n Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars.\" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.\n \n Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the \"face\" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and \"sunny\". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been \"obducted by aliens\". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that \"scientists don't believe there is a chance of this\" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.\n \n All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa. All of these things proove that not only was \"the Face of Mars\" just a natural forming landform. Will you know the real cause of something like \"The Face of Mars\" next time you see one?",

But a big percentage of those people said it looked like an aliens face which was a Huge rock formation but they kept defending their statement. But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.\n \n Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so. The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement. On Mars there is that to, the only three things Mars dosen't have is oxygen, water, or any subtance of food or plants that make oxygen. The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars. The thing is that no one really could of created that without any food or water.\n \n I think after all the research NASA has done and the studying of the natural landform on Mars that was created by Rock Formation turns out to be ture and for evryone that thinks that me and my team at NASA are wrong well no i don't think i am wrong i think i am way beyond positive that we are right because NASA has done everything they can to bring the people the right information. The people that think the natural landform was created by alliens need to join NASA so they can come along see that NASA brings only the truth noting but the truth to the people. But NASA always trys to do there best to convince people to know the right information and to have the correct facts in hand.",

    ESSAY: "The face on Mars is just another fake thing happening in this world. Honestly it is just another natural landform. Scientist might have been shocked when they saw it back in 1976 but know they are understanding and learning that the face is just a natural landform.\n \n The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.\n \n Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.\n \n This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.\n \n This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.\n \n The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.\n \n Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.\n \n When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.\n \n This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.\n \n The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.\n \n Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.\n \n Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.\n \n Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.\n \n This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.\n \n If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face.\n \n The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Scientists made a discovery on Cydonia,a region on the Red Planet. NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of the area, looking for sites for its sister ship, Viking 2. While it began to take pictures of the region, it spotted a human-like face. Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.\n \n It has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos. There was no alien monument, only a natural landform. Finally, they gave up.\n \n After eighteen long years of investigation, many researchers gave up on the Face. Many natural landforms disappear over time which is why scientists and researchers can no longer find it. Although, some researchers are still on the look out for the Face, hoping to find it again soon.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1 took a picture of what looked to be a a human face on Mars. A few days later the picture was reviealed to the public eye, and it was starred in hollywood film movies, books, magazines, and talks shows. But in 2001, new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it was only a mesa. Though there are many credible reasons to believe that it was only a mesa, some people still believe that is an alien artifact.\n \n Yes, one might think that the mesa looks like a face from an egyptian Pharoh, but after closer examination, it was only a natural landform. We are able to prove this because on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Sureyor flew over for the first time, a picture was taken that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that showed only a natural landform. When the picture was unveiled to the public eye, it had a caption that told people it was a mesa that resembled a human face only because shadows that were on the rock gave an opticl illusion of eye,nose, and mouth. Also on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enogh for a second look and used the cameras absolute maximum resolution to take an even better picture that again showed that it was only a mesa. From these pictures alone you can tell that there wasn't a face on Mars and that there isn't any extraterrestial beings living on Mars.\n \n in conclusion, the \"face\" on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform that you can probably see on Earth. Also if there were to actually be life on Mars, it would be a major break through that would help better fund NASA, so what would be the piont in trying to hide it from the public that funds our research?

    ESSAY: "So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?\" the man asked. \"I'm not buying it.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" I replied, \"and I'm about to show you why I'm right.\"\n \n The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, \"I'm all ears.\"\n \n The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\".\n \n To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the \"face\" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.\n \n \"Whatever, geek!

This figure is probably a fake because how often do you go to a planet and just find a random rock that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up.

It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.\n \n First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This \"alien created object\" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?\n \n Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.\n \n Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this \"plain\" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.\n \n It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.\n \n Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this.

    ESSAY: "Face\" the Facts\n \n The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the \"truth\" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the \"Face on Mars\" is nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" it says \"...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.\n \n Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.\n \n Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.\n \n To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to\n \n In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.\n \n - E.M.",

NASA has sent numerous things into space but one in specific has caused a great deal of curiosity through out the world. In 1976, a NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, took pictures of Mars and something unusual happened. A face apeared in a picture. At first NASA thought of the possibility of it being a foreign life form. But that possibility was stopped when scientists found out that it was just another Martian Mesa. A common landform on Mars. When the pictures were released to the public, many thought that NASA was lying, especially conspiracy theorists. They thought that NASA didn't want the public to know about an alien life form. That was very irrational.\n \n Many people don't like the idea of space exploration because they say it's a waste of money. If NASA encountered foreign life forms, it would only be benefitial to tell the public because then NASA would gain popolarity and skeptism of the program would decrease. Many people would be curios about it and would want to know more about the race. Therefore NASA would have a better reputation and be more popular because of their discovery.\n \n Secondly,technology has changed significantly since 1978. The original picture looks more like the face than any other one because of the old technology. In 1998, the picture looks more detailed. In 2001, it looks even more detailed. In 1976 the camera that took the photo only captured 43 meters per pixel making it much less definated compared to the picture taken in 2001 that captured 1.56 meters per pixel. This technology makes it less of a face.\n \n Finally, because of the newer and more advanced technology, NASA's scientists could look further in to the so called alien face. After studying it, the scientists concluded that the \"face\" was a mesa. A mesa isnt't only found on Mars. It can also be found on Earth. There is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it even has the same height as the Face on Mars. The \"face\" is more of a natural landform than anything.\n \n New technoogy, comparable lndforms, and the explanation of how alien races would benefit NASA helped the space program prove conspiricy theorists and the public wrong. All of these supports are hard evidence that the face was a mesa in disguise. Although the finding of an alien race would be revolutionary, it's safe to say that the \"face\" isn't the discovery of one. We'll just have to wait until the future to encounter a race that isn't our own.",

    ESSAY: "Since we had sent surveyors to Mars we have found many interesting things. We learned about much of the landscapes there and compared them to what we have here. Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa biom. The face in the area of Mars know as Cydonia is a mesa biom, so natural formations accur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa biom.\n \n The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not a alien structure. As it said in the article, \"Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact.\" They are the ones that truely study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique stucture that was naturaly created.\n \n The second reason is that the first image was burry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were cearer and prooved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.\n \n The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa biom. Things like this form all the time and should not be thought of a being made by anything other than nature. Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to accur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.\n \n There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa biom so this is natural.",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist at NASA I strongly believe that the \"The Face on Mars\" is simply a martian from of a mesa, which is commonly found on Cydonia. According to the text \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This was of course after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydonia and captured a higher resolution image of \"The Face.\" In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.\n \n Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.\n \n In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon \"Mars martian face\" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere. There was no need for all the chaos and random conspiracy theories, all it need was a little bit of science and hard work.",

On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.\n \n First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the \"facial features\" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.\n \n Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.\n \n Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the \"face\". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.\n \n In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point.

    ESSAY: "I can see why you can think that \"the Face on Mars\" is some form of proof that either alien life did at one time or is still cuurrently on Mars . The human mind is meant to think, imagine and wonder \"what if\". Let's say these \"aliens\" are in fact real and constructed \"the Face\" in order to communicate with us. Carving a giant face has got to be one of if not thee least effective way of dong so.\n \n These \"aliens\" very well could have simply just put a peice of shiney metal on the surface and the MGS would have seen it and we would probaly think \"hey, this unknown element is here on the surface of a planet where there are no metals\". Not only would it make us think that there is indeed metals on Mars but then we would think \"hey metals most usually form deep undergroud so there is no reason for this to be on the surface\". THAT would be a valid way of letting us know \"hey, we exist\".\n \n Also another thing, if \"aliens\" made \"the Face\" how is it no footprint s were found. And there's no wind on Mars they coulnt have blown away. Seriusly, that's a big project so you're gonna need a lot of your alien buddies to help you out with it and no footprints....hmm. Well hey,maybe they have got giant eagle wings and fly everywhere. Yeah, on a planet that HAS NO GRAVITY!\n \n Let's face it though (ha, face, get it?) everybody loves a good \"supernatural \" story. I believe that this is nothing more. \"Once in 1976 a NASA spacecraft was looking for a place to land, and there on the surface they found... a huge human's face carved out of the surface Mount Rushmore style....wooouuh\"\n \n In conclusion, The very thought that \"aliens\" somehow carved a face onto Mars is ridiculis . And the final nail in the coffin? When you hear \"conspiricy theorist\" you think of a frail, usually middle aged, pale becuase he hasn't stepped out of his trailer in weeks, guy with a aluminum cone on his head and always taling about how\"The Man\" is out to get him.\n \n Also he is dirty becuase hasnt shaved or showered in like a year.

    ESSAY: "The \"Face on mars\" is just a natural landform. Because of the unusual shadow on the Martian mesa it made it seem like there was a Egyptian Pharaoh's face. When NASA unveilde the picture for everyone to see they specificly said in the caption that it was a huge rock formation that resembled a humans face, but because of the shadows it gave the illusion of a human face because of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Which is not really possible for the people to believe that Aliens had created this because of all the pictures that where taken there was no picture with a alien life form. Another reason for this is that you can see things in the digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. That way if there were other objects on Mars than you would be able to see that they were.

    ESSAY: "Many people still believe that the Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it's to hard to really know what the object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.\n \n Based on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn't mean it is that.\n \n Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west.\" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.\n \n The first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, \"the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze.\" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.\n \n Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, \"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.\n \n Based on research, and facts from, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars\"\n \n On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.\n \n Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.\n \n The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA\"s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.\n \n In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",

NASA was confident that it was a formation as well after posting it on their website they captioned \" A huge rock formation\" this shows that the majority of NASA believe this as well. I know no aliens know what we look like because we never seen any aliens orbiting or trying to take a photo.

Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.\n \n Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars. Usually the crafts land on 3 or more legs. The craft could have possibly marked a dust mound. Wind three or more legs, you could form the face on Mars' surface.\n \n What NASA needs to do is send more crafts and robots.

    ESSAY: "The face is just a natural landform and not evidence of an alien attack. There are many reasons why this landform is only natural and not any type of alien proof. One of those is that if NASA found a secret alien civiilization they would tell us because it would help increase their budget. Another reason that it's just a natural landform is because it is just like some other natural landforms on Earth and other mesa's on Mars. The last reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that NASA is scietifically trained and would know if it was proof of alien's existence but the conspiracy theorists aren't scientifically trained and would be less likely to know exactly what it is.\n \n The first reason that it's just a natural landform is that NASA would tell us if it was proof of an alien attack. It states in the text that \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" which shows how it would help increase their budget. Since the Face is so popular and has even become a pop icon if NASA were to find out it was proof of an alien attack they would most likely tell us because since it is so popular it would give them a significant increase to their budget. That is just one of the three reasons that I will b talking about in this essay.\n \n The second reason that the Face is just a natural landform is because it is just like other landforms on Earth and around that area on mars. In the article it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West\". That passage from the article shows that there are landforms on Earth that look similar to that one on Mars so it couldn't be proof of an alien attack. The article also says \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh\". That shows that other landforms that resemble the Face on that part of Mars isn't uncommon. The only thing that made the Face stand out from other landforms was the shadows which made it appear to have a face that looked like an egyptian pharoah.\n \n The third and final reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that the scientists would know better than any of the conspiracy theorists would so we should believe them. NASA has no reason to hide the Face from us because even if it was an alien attack, as I stated in paragraph two, it would help increase their budget. Other conspiracy theorists believe NASA is just trying to hide the proof of an alien attack but if that was what they were doing, they wouldn't have released a picture of the Face at all. Also when NASA realeased a new high resolution image in 2001 and a 3D altimetry of the Face, the landform no longer reseambled a face, which is proof that it is just a mesa.\n \n Those 3 reasons are the reasons you should believe scientists and not think it is an alien landform. NASA has nothing to hide since it would increase their budget. They also are more trained in knowing what landforms on mars are than any conpiracy theorists are. The other reason is because there are many other landforms on Earth that resemble faces which could be compared to the Face. Those 3 reasons are why we should all stop trying to make conspiracy theories and just believe what NASA is trying to tell us, that it's just a mesa.",

    ESSAY: "Long ago, Vikings spotted a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. It was about two miles long and was located on a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some people are convinced that aliens on the Red Planet, but others would beg to differ. Most scientists agree that aliens are just a myth and they did not build the \"face. Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he \"face.\"\n \n For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the \"face\" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this \"face\" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face.\" Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.\n \n Still not satisfied with my argument? If not, listen to this. With all of the new technology these days, there is even more proof as to why there was no aliens who built the \"face.\" A camera took photos of the \"face\" with maximum resolution. With the high technology cameras, scientists could look at the photo three times as large as the origianl snapshot. Becasue the scientists can zoom in so much, they would have been able to see if there were any aliens on the planet. The picture actually shows Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, which are llandforms commonly located around American West.\n \n Most scientists would agree that there never was alien life on Cydonia.

    ESSAY: "Do you believe in aliens? In 1976 the Viking 1 spacecraft of NASA discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face! Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.\n \n The first reason why this \"face\" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.\n \n Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\n \n However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.\n \n So in conclusion the \"face\" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.",

Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the \"human Face\". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do.

Many conspiracy theorists get too overwhelmed when they see this face, because they are so eager for scientsists to find life on another planet. Although it looks as if something made the Face, it was made naturally.\n \n First, the Martian mesa is very common around the area of Cydonia. It was not a big surprise to some scientists to find that it was formed naturally. NASA revealed the image captioning, \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The unusual shadows made the landform seem to be a human face.\n \n Next, the Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a photo that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This made the picture even more accurate. When the picture was first unveiled on a JPL web site, people found that the Face was a naturally landform. It was not caused by aliens or other life forms.\n \n Then, Malin's team took a clearer photo than the 1976 Vikining picture. Malin's team's captured a picture on April 8, 2001, in which each pixel spaned 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the Viking photograph. According to the article, you can distinctly view objects three times bigger in a digital image than the pixel size. In paragraph 11, the author says \"So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" The 2001 picture shows that the Martian is equivalent to landforms that are common near the American West.\n \n Ultimately, the research and pictures were clear, the landform was not made by any life forms. The Face was formed naturally. The Martian mesa is very common in the area of Cydonia, where it was found by. Scientists and their teams captured photos that showed that this was landform was caused naturally.

My three reasons of why it is a landform is because the planet Mars cannot support life. Also because it is just the lighting forming the eyes nose and the mouth and it is just a landform. I know it is a landform that has just eroded over hundreds of years.\n \n On Mars there is no oxygen no water or life that is because the planet cannot support life. The planet is compleltly dead. If there was a civlization then they would of had to of built a house with airlocks just to survive. Even if the Aliens did not need air to breath they would have gotten to hot and they need mosture to survive. And you would think that we would have found a civilization or something that would have kept them alive by now. In the text it says it would be cool if there was an ancient civilization.\n \n The landform looks like it has eyes a nose and a mouth but really it is just the lighting reflecting on the landform. If the sun is hitting the landform then it will cause a shadow to creat the look of eyes a nose and a mouth. But after many years the landform has eroded to form a face like look. Sense the planet Mars has allways been the closest to the sun. It is alot hotter than earth so there is allways heat waves so that is what caused the erosen on the landform. In the text it states that the eyes nose and mouth are just an illusion.\n \n This is a landform because the planet is completly dead. Mars cannot support life because it is too hot and it gets heat waves. Also the light refelects off the landform and creats a shadow of eyes a nose and a mouth. The landform has had many years to erode. In the text it states it is just a martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n It would be cool if there was aliens that created the landform. We could see how they adapted to surviving on the planet and its harsh conditions. They might help us addapt to Mars and we can help them adapt to our planet. But NASA would become more famous than what it is today. Because they would want to have all the land marks for artifacts and it would probably make the aliens mad.\n \n The landform on Mars was not created by aliens because we would have known by now. Also because Mars cannot support life the lighting on the planet creats the eyes the nose and the mouth like a illusion. And for all we know it is just a landform. I know it is just a landform that has eroded over hundreds of years.",

Plus theres no such things as aliens.\n \n Who would even think that there could possibly aliens on mars. Nasa is for the study on space, and just to think yo guys think you know more then them is ridiculous. I understand you have your beliefs, but sometimes you treally just ahev to sit back and say is this logica. If your at the point where you say yeah this is absoulutely right, theres obviously some mental issues going on.\n \n So baed on things in this passge such as the images, you never know the nasa company could b sneaky and photoshop the picture. Just for the controversy thats going on now. In the first picture it resembles nothing but a land form like structure. So as i was saying in the first paragraph stop trying to get attention on some so little.",

    Essay: "I know that people are saying that this is proof that aliens inhabit Mars, but trust me, this is not proof. I wish this was proof. It's exactly what we need to hear right now. It's exactly what we've been needing to hear for years. We wan't to find evidence of life on Mars, so why would be hide any signs from you?\n \n If you still don't belive me, look closer at it. Some images the face is more clear than others. That means that the eyes and nose that you see are just shadows. Aliens wouldn't make an artifact that only looks like a face from certain angles. They would want it to stand out.\n \n Some of you say that the alien markings are hidden behind the wispy clouds. Well, we checked again at a time when it was clear and you could see everything fine. There were no alien markings. Like I said, if there were we would have been extatic. The whole world would have known about it within a few days.\n \n I know it has become a huge pop icon, and I'm sorry yo ruin this for you, but it has to be done. It's just a landform. It's very common around the American West. It resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If you still want to think that it's a face created by aliens then be my guest. Nobody can stop you.\n \n For those of you who now believe that it's a natural land mark, Nasa is just as disapointed as you. We wanted it to be created by aliens too. It would be pretty nice to finally have actual proof in the existence in aliens. Hopefully our trip to Mars will help us find proof in their existence.",

    Essay: "Mars is a very interesting planet with many marvelous sites. It is even called the Red Planet thanks to its bright red hue. Also, Mars has a region called Cydonia. This region contains the popular \"Face on Mars\". The Face is believed to be an alien artifact.\n \n In 1976, scientists discovered one of the biggest wonders in the world ... \"the Face on Mars\". This happened during one of Viking 1 missions to look for a landing site for his sister ship, Viking 2. Scientists guessed it to be another \"Martian messa\", which was common in the region of Cydonia. After unveiling the image to all people, \"to attract attention to Mars\", many people believed that it was evidence for life on the Red Planet. Some people even said that \" the Face is \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide\" but, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\", which shows that NASA would actually benefit from an alien life form so they had no reason to hide it from the world.\n \n There are many facts that help support the fact that there is no alien life form on Mars. For example, in 1998: the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of the Face on Mars, which was ten times sharper than the Viking photos, that revealed the \"Face\" to actually be a natural landform. Still not all people believed, so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a second look of the Face. The picture was taken by a camera in which, \"each pixel in the image spanned 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" The picture taken by this camera ended up showing a \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" and not a face built by an alien civilization. In conclusion, you could still believe there to be aliens on Mars, but you would just be ignoring the facts that the scientist of NASA have presented in their photos of Mars from the years 1998 and 2001.",

    Essay: "Did you know on Mars there is a face? Some people think it was created by aliens. Other people think it is just a natural landform on Mars. The face on Mars was first discovered in 1976.\n \n When they first saw it it looked like a \"shadowy likeness of a human face\". It was an enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end. When they first discovered it they saw it staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. I am going to be telling you why this is just a natural landform on Mars.\n \n When scientist first saw it in 1976, they thought it was just another Martian mesa which is common around Cydonia. They knew is was some type of landform. A few days later, NASA unvieled the image for all to see. The caption was \"huge rock formation which resembles a human head\". The only reason they said it was aliens, was to get people's attention. That is exaclty what it did.\n \n Eventually on April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia for the first time to check it out. While they were there Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. When the image first apperared on a JPL web site it revealed it was just a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was convinced it was just a landform. Many people still thought it had something to do with aliens. But, how could aliens have done it? No one knows.\n \n On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew a close enough second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,\"Garvin stated. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size\", Garvin added. \"So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" he added. They could tell there was nothing just the land its self. It could not have been aliens.\n \n What the pictures they actually took show is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common in the American West. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\", Garvin says. Garvin ended his statement with,\"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n Coming to a conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Even Garvin, the Mars Global Surveyor said it himself,\"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivlent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West\". The Face on Mars is really, just an natural landform.",

    Essay: "You may think the Face is created by aliens, but it simply is not. You see, we here at NASA have been studying and researching other planets for years. Don't you think that with our intelligence, we would know if something that looks like alien evidence actually is alien evidence? We would not only let everyone know, but we would make a very big deal out of it. This is just a natural landform.\n \n I know it is silly that there is literally a face on Mars, but it's not as big of a deal as you think. Have you ever looked at the leaves in a tree or the coulds in the sky and seen something put together that resembles an animal or shape? This is kind of like that. It's cool, but it doesn't exactly mean the universe is trying to give you a sign of life. When we released these photos to the public, people thought for sure we were hiding something like we had an agenda to have an alien takeover. They said it was \"bona fide evidence of life on Mars\". Trust me, we wish there was life on Mars! That would be ground-breaking news! We are not hiding a single secret, and we are speaking the truth.\n \n Perhaps, of course, we will find life on the red planet someday. This landform is not evidence to support that moment. On a bright and clear day on April 8, 2001, we took a very high-detailed photo of the face. If there were any outstanding undeniable resemblinces to a human face, we would've seen it. It is much like any other landform from the American West, like a certain one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Truly any other butte or mesa, just this time its on a different planet.\n \n So, afterall, it's settled. This face-like landform on Mars is not a sign of any martians or aliens, sadly. Conspiracy theorists will go on with their unreasonable theories and we will stick to the cold hard facts, thank you very much. I hope you have realized just how wrong everyone has been and just how much more logical you should be thinking. Don't get me wrong, I and most workers at NASA certainly belive in aliens. This just isn't anything to get to excited about. Keep in touch, though, you never know when the next big discover will come about.",

Usually if the face was created by aliens there would surely be a way bigger mark. As well as there would be plenty more marks surrounding that face. This proves that this mark is simply just a landform.\n \n Also, there is plenty of life-like landforms created with the surface of the area. Just so it happens to be on a planet doesn't mean there has to be a wild explanation to this landform. There is life-like landforms that sometimes look a a full body and there are some that look like half of a body. Many of those landforms have been scientifically proven to be just a landform. Also, with all the human shaped landforms we have all of them should be claimed to be created by aliens! Once again, there is no way this landform can be created by aliens.

When the photo was first released, many thought it was an alien structure and that it proved there once was life on Mars. NASA then worked harder to understand the strange picture and to change the opinion of skeptics who tried to make it an ancient temple.\n \n The first photo that was released was a low quality picture and the strange shadows gave it the look of a face. NASA began to obsess about the face and they began to get better and better resolution photos. It became more apparent that the face was just a mesa, which were common in the area. Skeptics insisted that NASA proves that is just a hill and NASA continued finding out more about the mesa. as the resolution improved, nearly all second-guessers were silenced. This happened because scientists were convinced that this landform was much like the Middle Butte in Idaho, which was most definately not made by aliens.\n \n The Face did change how some people looked at the possibility of life on Mars. After the initial controversy, it was likely that the \"alien\" building was just a hill. Some still are skeptical even with the overwelming evidence, but they are also drowned out by those who know it was just an optical illusion.

If there were to have been a sign of life on that planet (Mars) it would benefit NASA and the whole world would probably know. \"The face\" is located on the part if Mars called \"Cydonia\" which according to Jim Garvin \"Is not easy to target (paragraph 9).\"\n \n Mission controllers are preparing to go back and look again so they can try to prove that NASA is not trying to hide any evidence.

One thing we discovered in our research was throughout the years that we have taken these photographs that the \"face\" has started to just look like a big rock.

    Essay: "Three pictures were taken of this odd feature on the land of Mars. The reasoning for the interest of the pictures is because they think the figure of the shape is a face. The first time they saw it they were astonished and had many questions that they sent other spacecrafts to take pictures two other different times. I believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural formed mound and scientist need to stop listening to theories.\n \n One reason to stop looking for a civilization is because it is not important. Mars Global Surveyor even said that finding the face is hard work itself because we dont even pass over the Face very often. We don't need to wasting our time on something that is not going to affect us here on Earth. Also, after the discovery and the first picture was taken it was just a landform not an alien momument that some people predicted or hoped to be.\n \n Second, if you look at the pictures you see a difference in all three of them. If there was an ancient civilization wouldn't you think the pictures would be more extravagent each time after the first. What we see is the complete opposite of what was just explained. As each picture gets newer the face looks much more deteriorated than before. They face is practically gone by the third picture and there is nothing really of it to say that it was a face.\n \n Lastly, Even if there were airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or things smaller you could see them from the cameras. So don't you think that if there were people on the planet you would also see them as well in the other three photos.\n \n I can see where some people might be interested in the idea of there being people on another planet. It would be awesome to know that you could or can survive on another planet knowing if something happens to the one we are on now. We could even add more information on alien research NASA has been doing.\n \n In conclusion, the Face did turn out to be a mesa and or butte. The same thing as a mesa but a lava dome and just maybe happened to be the same height as the Face on Mars. Also, the pictures you could tell it wasn't a face the dome shaped thing didn't match the features of the far away picture of the Face.",

And my explanation for that is because if they want to have a more clearer picture then they should take another one up there. And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows. They might argue that im wrong because they might say that why will they need the technology and they might say like well we already have a picture and its a face. But it could possibly be something else. It could be a mountain with craters, it can be mostly anything. I also could be wrong becuase they do have a Mars rover up there so my theory can be wrong and it is a face all along. If I was the a scientist at NASA talking to someone about why the face on mars wasent created by aliens i would tell them that extra terrestrial life couldn't of done that because we dont have enough evidence to prove that they exist. But for now we don't know 100% that aliens did it or if metors hit it and it looked like a face or if aliens did it. And if aliens really did it then we need to get nother camera up there and see if there is any other life out there. Then the person who is asking that question would say \"havent you guys already put one up there and theres nothing\".

Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.\n \n The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument. \"But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze\" Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.\n \n \"But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?\" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform.

In paragraph 2, the author states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah.\" I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing. In the introduction, it says, \"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa.\" If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.",

    Essay: "My name is Proffesor Yado, and my colleague and I were discussing on the infamous \"Face on Mars\". My colleague believes in superstition and conspiracies so he stated that the face on Mars must be of extraterrestrial origin. I said that was porposterous, but my colleague continued to try and convince me to no availe. I told my colleague there are many reasons why the some scientists and people thought the \"Face on Mars\" looked like a face. I then procedded to tell him my reasons.\n \n First off, cameras at the time were not as advanced as they are today. The cameras of the day would \"distort the image and it would only capture the major features of the butte or mesa. The most recent image taken of the \"Face on Mars\" in 2001 looks very different from the original image taken in 1976. If there was a actual structure left by aliens, modern cameras would be able to see it. The the more modern cameras of today are able to see the more defining features of a object.\n \n Secondly humans are remarkably good at seeing faces when there is not one there. When you look at a wall socket you can see what resembles a face when there is not one there. It is the same thing with the \"Face on Mars\". With the aid of shadows from the Sun, are ability to see faces when none are there, and the angle the picture was taken, the butte or mesa looks remarkably like a face or some alien made structure.\n \n In response to what I said my colleague had some things to say to try and disprove me. Due to my colleague believing in superstition and conspiracies he believed NASA and the government are hiding the truth from us. He stated they were hiding this from us because of what happened with H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds, which caused a massive panic. The government don't want another mass panic so they have been keeping us away from the truth that aliens exist. My colleague also stated that possibly alien markings were hidden by haze as some other theorists thing so. I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing.\n \n Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.",

    Essay: "Natures Faces\n \n There are many reason to why the face is just a logical thing that can happen. It could've been buttes or mesa landforms that are located in the American West. Also, there is no reason NASA would have for trying to hide something so major from the world. Lastly, if their was aliens on mars, wouldn't their be more evidence supporting the aliens instead of nothing?\n \n Garvin from Mars Global Surveyor, talks about how it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho as stated in paragraph 12. Anyone could go to Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho and see for themselves if they look alike. A simple way to put it is that their are so many things this \"face\" could've been other than aliens. Which is why most people don't believe in this \"theory\" because it is far from practical.\n \n Although NASA could hide what they saw at Mars, why would they? There is no reason for NASA to keep anything they discover a secret, or try and hide anything from us. NASA wouldn't have even shared the photo if they felt that they didn't want for anyone to know, to stir up this controversy in the first place! The astronauts were most likely just as shocked as we were when they saw the image.\n \n Lastly, there isn't enough evidence to infer that there is any type of life form on Mars. In paragraph 9 of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" it talks about how it isn't easy to target where the face is. If the face was a form of life there would be more, and it probably wouldn't be so hard to find. Most likely there wouldn't be one face but many.\n \n Even with every fact in the world there are still the great questions we all have from time to time. Even with the facts we all know about. Though I think that there is no possible way there could be any existence on Earth. You could always say \"what if.\" Which is why I hope you take my words into accountance when you think about the face on mars.",

    Essay: "That photo is not an alien. What photo am I talking about? The photo the NASA took of the \"face\"that is shown in a lot of places. In the arcticle its says,\"The Â“Face on MarsÂ” has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showsÂ—even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not. It is not an alien because it is just a natural land form, it is hard to target(because it never moves, small and blends in with all the rest of noraml mars), and people say it looks like a normal natural lava dome (and it does).\n \n It is just a natural land from. It is only shaped like a face. There is nothing odd or strang about it besides the shaping. It just happened to look like a face. In the texts it says, \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" This shows it had nothing to so with aliens, it was just a land form.\n \n If it was a living thing, or used to be living shouldn't move around?Â“ItÂ’s not easy to target Cydonia,Â” says Garvin. This shows it is one spot and small. It also proves it blends in like in other natural land form would do. If it was something special you would think it would be easier to find. If you don't look very closly you don't even see the face at all.\n \n Not only is it natural land, but it is also reminds Garvin of a lava dome of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,Â” says Garvin. Â“ThatÂ’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.Â” This again proves if you ignore the fact that it looks like a face, it looks completely normal. It looks like a normal thing any planet would have, even earth.\n \n Some may agrue it looks to much like a face to not be something like an alien. Even though it is funny how much it looks like face, there are too many facts proving it isn't anything different from everything else on the planet mars. It just happened to be the way it formed it looked like a face.\n \n There are many things proving, this thing on Mars is not an alien or created by aliens. First, it is just like anyother land form, just a \"werid\" shaping. Second, it blends in, is small and doesn't move. (This makes it hard to target.) Finally, it reminds people of a lava dome, again showing it is just shaped weird to us. The face got the attention of the public for a while, like the text said,\"The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" But, everyone needs to let it go because it is nothing to talk about since we now know the truth. It was fun for a while, but if you still believe it more than a normal part of mar's natural land, you will look like a fool. I guess we will have to keep looking on other planents to find live or \"aliens\" because so far it is for sure not on mars!",

    Essay: "Have have you ever wanted to learn more about something like about a person or maybe... a planet? This essay is on unmasking the face on Mars, is it real? or fake?\n \n Well is is in fact real in here are the reasons why.\n \n First, it is real because Twenty five years ago we spotted something weird happening on Mars. One of our spacecrafts, The Viking 1, was getting pictures of what may be possible land sites for its sister ship, The Viking 2. It was then that we noticed something strange, it was like a shadowy likeness of a human face. It had an ENORMOUS head nearly almost two miles end to end. it ALMOST looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n Next, a few days later we unveiled the image for everyone to see...even though we were not sure how everyone would react. But to NASA's surpise, everyone loved it it was in movies, books,magazines etc. There were some people out there who didn't belive it, said it was probably fake and that we were just trying to scare people into thinking aliens were real. But it was real alright and we have the evidence to prove it.\n \n Third, even though few scientists believed it to the Face of an alien artifact, the photos of Cydonia became important to NASA when the Global Surveyor (MGS) to the Mars in September. After 18 years, the Viking missions ended. Not every one was okay with though. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north latitude, it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of the year on Mars. We tried to take a look at it one more time but it was to late. When the cloudiness ended on mars we had put another spacecraft on Mars. when we got pictures back you could then all the detail and more on the face.\n \n Even though some people may still not ever believe it, we just want them to just acknowledge the thought of '' What If?''. Then maybe they could see that this really is an anicent alien mark.",

Well stop, because that is false information. Just read this short essay and change your mind about the subject of aliens.\n \n In 1976 the Viking 1 sent a picture of a supposed face. NASA, shortly after getting the image, then made a false testimony stateing that an alien carved face is on Mars. The now famous image of Mars took a name The Face. Now twenty-two years later NASA tries again at a picture of The Face. The picture turns out good, but a cloud blocks a part of the image. The people aren't happy and they get NASA, three years later to get another picture, and it it shows no evidence of an alien carved face. The talk of The Face soon dies down.\n \n So to sum up what happened, in 1976 the Viking 1 sends a picture of a \"face\". NASA states that this is an alien's doing. The image recieves the name The Face. Twenty-two years later NASA tries again, and gets a good picture, but a cloud blocks the right side. The people aren't happy. Once again NASA takes another picture, and there is no face. So after reading this you still have your opinion, or you just changed it, but I firmly believe that alien life is a hoax.",

    Essay: "As a scientist at NASA, I know that this \"face\" found on Cydonia is just a natural landform that makes the shadow of a human face. Natural landforms often make shadows when light hits it at a certain angle. This causes the shadows to form things like faces, animlas, or other things. For example, when Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking photots of possible landing sights for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadow likely to be of a humans face. The shadow made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n Some scientists think that the \"face\" could also have been an alien artifact. That may be possible but, its more likely to be a shadow caused by the formation of he land. The \"face\" is caused by rock formations which resembles a human head giving an illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth. More scientists believe that this \"face\" is most likely to be caused by shadows.",

    Essay: "The Face is a natural Martian mesa, like many others. People have wondered if aliens have built it before, but they had no proof. NASA has already proven with evidence it is just a natural land formation.\n \n First, NASA decided to release the pictures of the Face for the public to see, but they only did this to get more people intrested in Mars! To prove that the Face was just a land formation naturaly made, NASA decided to show better quality photos to the public. So they sent out pictures that were ten times sharper to show it was a ROCK formation. Also if there was life on Mars NASA would benifit from it, so i dont see why they would lie.\n \n Next, Mars is a planet with many unknown discoverys but the ones that NASA do figure out the more information we gain for the future. For example in the text it says that Mars has many Martian mesas, so it could be a coinicidence that ONE looks like a face. This doesn't prove there isn't life on Mars but for the information we have at the moment it is doubtful.\n \n Lastly, There are many people in the would who make this stuff up, so why would believe THEIR opinion over NASA who research on space. Don't forget that the only reason they got the information of the Face was because NASA unvieled it. If they had something they didn't want us to know about they would have kept it to themselves.\n \n The Face is just a rock formation. Others might say something like it looks like a human face, or why would it look like a face if the life on Mars hadn't built it. The reason it looks like a face is because the mesa formed that way. It couldn't even have been built by life on Mars because it's over 2 miles wide, so it has to be a land formation.",

    Essay: "The conspiracy about there being life on the moon in this article is not correct. For someone to claim there is life anywhere but the planet Earth needs to provide evidence.

The article however cannot provide proof or hardly any evidence there are living things on Mars.\n \n The article does provide a picture, but the picture is nothing but a mear misunderstanding. The picture provided is what is called a lava dome, simply shapes creating the form of a face. People like to take little things and make them into something just because they can.

Angle is everuthing, angle can make something look like it actually isn't, it plays tricks on your mind and your eyes.\n \n Maybe this is a mark left by an ailen and if so scientists are ready to let out all the truth because the public isnt ready for something new, something unheard of. The only thing the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or a mesa, landforms common around the american west, does this mean aliens are also on our planet? I think not. There is no life on Mars proven what so ever and all that this picture is is a misshaped landform misrepresented.

They rolled the spacecraft25 degrees to the center of the face in the field of veiw. Then Malin team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera maximum resolution. Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best1976 viking photo. You can see in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixek size.

    Essay: "How do you think the Face was formed. There could be many reasons how the Face was formed. However I think that the Face was not formed by aliens. One reason is, is that they haven't prove that aliens are real yet. Also, that the day they took they picture they said that there was wispy clouds over it. Another reason is that it all happend because of science.\n \n Mars is an odd planet, I've heard people call it the pizza planets because it was red, I think. That's not the point though, the point is, is that the planet has not proven that aliens live on that planet. The face had been thought it was created by aliens. NASA said that the Face was a \"huge rock formation\" showing the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. There are more reasons why they face was Face was not formed by aliens.\n \n Another reason is that the day they took the picture, there was wispy winds. In order to take a good picture you need to have good weather. The weather can effect the picture because if it's windy you need to make sure that everything is not blowing around. The wispy winds could have effected the picutre becuase the winds were blowing so the rocks, sand and everything else was blowing around. So, when Viking 1 captured that picture, it can everything else blowing with it. Wind storms happen on planets, I am not sure om which ones but i know they happen-just like how on the sun it doesn't have wind storms but has almosr like volcanic action on it with lave everywhere. There is one more other reason.\n \n One more reason is that is just plain old science. Science occurs in a lot of discussing and working on the planet. When planning to send some sort of machine to a planet, you have to undertand the planet. In 1976 there wasn't the best technology at the time. They didn't know when a storm was gonna come or if they would have to send their machines threw a bunch of metors. When they sent out Viking 1 a win storm occured and the camera on Viking 1 couldn't focus right and that is why it looked like a face.\n \n There are many more reasons why the Face was not formed but an aliens. Some are that it was that aliens have not been proven yet. Also, that there was wispy clounds. One more is that is was all science. Those are resons why that the Face was not formed by aliens.",

In the passage it says \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on MarsÂ—evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.

After all, seeing is believing. The images progressively get better and better. Some people may argue that the when they took the picture in \"April Â’98Â—a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" But that cant be true since NASA eventually went out and took an even better picture in 2001, proving that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, in the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" the Face was just a natural landform, it was not created by aliens. The Face resembled land forms on Earth. NASA is a government agency and would not lie about it, since it would overall benefit them. Last but not least, the images are enough proof that it is nothing more than a land form. The images progressively get better, which in return, proves that the Face is nothing more than a land form that is common on Mars.",

    Essay: "In this essay you will see reasons for the people who think it was created by aliens, and the people who think that it was not created by aliens. You will also see textual evidence for those reasons that we have. In this article we will be talking about \" The Face on Mars\". So here our the reasons for us to think it was created by aliens and for it not to be created by aliens.\n \n I believe that the face n mars was not created by aliens. I believe that because of how the \"face\" has evolved. In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.\n \n This article it also states that the \"Face on Mars\" is really just a mesa. Which proves that the so called \"face\" is not a face and it is just a landform.\n \n Others still thought it was a face. Those people thought that because of what the article says in parargraph 11. In paragraph 11 it states that \" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" So because of what they had said in that paragraph people believed that they had saw a face.\n \n Those are the reasons for why people had thought that the \"Face on Mars\" was an actual face. Also the reasons why people thought that it was just a natural landform instead.",

On Earth we have these mesas too. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\"\n \n Even though it may look like an artifact its not because it was just formed like that. The mesa has nothing to hide becaus eour satelights have take many pictures of this mesa and this is no evidence of an alien presence on Mars. There are no sybols of any kind on or near the face or shacks or anything that could lead to the conclousion that aleins had built the face.\n \n This is my evidence that the \"Face on Mars\" is just a common landform that was misconceived as a face of sorts built by aliens. Even though it may just be a common landform it is hard to belive this is not an artifact from an anceint civilization that lived on Mars.",

    Essay: "Do you really thing a land form could make a face ? To me that seems something is very unlikely. A planet that we do not look alike can make a face as a organism on earth? Well i don't think so and here is why.\n \n The photo isn't clearly shown as a face it just looks like a planets land form.\n \n It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders. I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead. Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face. If you look closley you can see that the\n \n \"face\" has ridges or canyon. So maybe the ridegs/canyons made the land form that way.\n \n NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac. According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years.\n \n In conclusion the \"face'' to me is still just a land form. Just because it looks as if it is something could not just be made out of a human face. If they had more evidence then it would be believeable but until then my opnion is still that it is a land form.",

    Essay: "Space is a strange place with an unlimited amount of possibilities, one of which is the possibility of alien life. Because of this, I can understand why you might think that this is evidence of alien life. In hopes of debunking this suspicion, I am hoping you will read through my provided evidence that supports my claim that this \"face\" was not created by aliens.\n \n First off, NASA would not be trying to hide the existence of aliens from the public. Their budget is primarily based on the tax and donation of those who are interested in space. If aliens were to exist, and NASA knew this, telling the public would give their budget a massive increase. So, to dismiss the accusation that NASA is hiding proof of evidence from you, I assure you that they would have told us just to get the much needed rise in their budget.\n \n The picture of the \"face\" was taken forty years ago, just seven years after we first landed on the moon. As stated in the article, this was, in fact, the best resolution they could take the picture with. If you put two and two together, you can conclude that the highest resolution at the time was not very high at all compared to modern day photos.\n \n Finally, you must take into considerationg that Mars is just like Earth, a planet. This means that it will have geographical land marks just like Earth. This \"face\" has been confirmed to be butte or mesa, which are common here on Earth, as said in the article. If we were to colonize Mars in the future, and someone were to observe Earth and see such a land formation, do you think they'd call it proof of aliens? Of course not!\n \n With the evidence I provided above, I hope you are able to make your own conclusion. As said before, the vast emptiness of space is impossible to predict, and the existence of aliens is likely. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want to believe when it comes to aliens, so I am only able to hope that you are convinced by my essay.",

Was it? Or is this mysterious likeness just something as normal as a natural landform?\n \n Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976. The camera's absolute maximum was 43 meters per pixel. By looking at the photograph, you wouldn't be able to make a definate conclusion about what exactly the figure was and how it got on the surface of Mars.\n \n Later, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was able to capture a photograph with an absolute maximum of 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters per pixel like in the 1976 Viking photo. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. Jim Garvin even said, \"You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n Garvin also mentioned that they don't pass over the figure as a face very often and that what the image actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West.\n \n Like I mentioned in the first paragraph; some are to belive this figure was created by aliens.

    Essay: "Landform, Not Aliens\n \n The \"face\" on Mars has been a topic of discussion for almost twenty-five years. Was it created by an unknown species of aliens? Definitely not. Although, some people do think that, the \"face\" on Mars is actually just a natural landform that happened to be shaped like a face. Obviously, the \"face\" on Mars is a natural landform, not something created by aliens.\n \n To begin, the \"face\" on Mars is just a natural landform. What else could it be? Some say it was a statue built by aliens. But, that can't possibly be true. There is no proof that aliens exist in the first place, so how could a species that doesn't exist build a statue? Also, NASA released information saying that it was just a huge mesa forming into the shape of a face. The shadows just give it the illusion of eyes and a nose. Finally, the pictures of the \"face\" obviously show that it is not a built structure. It is just a natural landform on Mars. The pictures get clearer each time they were taken, so it is very apparent that the \"face\" is just a huge formation of rocks. So, all of this shows that there is no possible way that the \"face\" on Mars was built by aliens.\n \n Although, I do understand why people could believe the \"face\" was built by aliens. It does look like it could be a monument, like the ancient Egyptians built for their people. However, life does not exist on Mars; therefore, the \"face\" could not be built by aliens. Also, some people think that aliens do exist on mars, and that NASA is just hiding it. But, why would NASA hide that they found an alien civilization? That could only help the company, not hurt them. And, if you still don't believe me, if there were aliens on Mars, wouldn't we be able to or have seen them by now? Once again, I say that the \"face\" on Mars is just a mesa that gives the illusion of a face, not a statue built by creatures that don't exist.\n \n In conclusion, the \"face\" on Mars is just a natural landform, not something that was created by aliens. In the future, we might find out for certain what that \"face\" is. We aren't one hundred percent positive it is a mesa, but we know it wasn't aliens.

    Essay: "Have you seen the \"Face on Mars\"? If so, do you believe it is natural or created by alien activity? Many people believe the face is evidence of alien life however this is probably not the case. The Mars Global Surveyor ,a mapping spacecraft, has passed over the area few times. However the few times it has passed over there has been no evidence of any form of alien civilization. This led us to believe it is just a natural landform.\n \n This all began when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars. Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible landing sites for his sibling Viking 2. In the midst of doing so Viking 1 spotted what looked like a human face. This was extraordinary because it was on planet Mars! When the images were leaked it led the public to believe that this is evidence of life outside of Earth's atmosphere.\n \n This might not be the case however. NASA believes that the face is just a natural landform similiar to a butte or mesa on that of Earth. There was a lot more evidence pointing towards the side of NASA but that didn't put peoples hopes down. Some of the public hoped and believed this was in some shape or form, evidence of extraterrestriel life.\n \n The pictures of the \"Face on Mars\" that NASA had were actually kind of foggy. They were foggy because the Mars Global Surveyor had to get the photos through clouds. This then led people to believe that NASA was hiding something in the fog. They thought they were hiding the evidence of life. NASA, however wanted to show them this was not the case.\n \n NASA then ,a few years later, passed over the face on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, and rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. NASA eventually captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. This photo cleared up a lot of confusion.\n \n As NASA studied the photograph, they came to realize that the Face was in fact caused by natural means. They then leaked the image to the public and cleared up confusion there too. However, there will always be that group of nay sayers. This group still wanted to believe that the \"Face on Mars\" was evidence of alien life. They still might believe that to this day.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" has caused a lot of confusion and mystery in the world. Many believed it was natural from the beginning and others not so much. Some have even grown to believe it was natural other than caused by aliens. Of course there are people still on both sides and as of right now we will never completely know the truth. We will know the truth when we go to Mars. Until then everyone will hold their peace and glorify at the mysterious \"Face on Mars\".",

Besides those reasons i still disagree with you about it and i do have proof of my reasons why.\n \n The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" tells me that scientist Jim Garvin was one of the men that took the picture of the \"face\" inApril 8, 2001. After Jim takes the picture and tells everyone, \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" Jims says this because, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\n \n Also there are unusual shadows to make it look like the landform has eyes and a nose.

People have been wondering for years what this odd shaped landform is, could it be an alien statue or just a natural landform. The Face is not an alien formation, but a natural landform.\n \n When NASA sent Viking 1, in 1976, to photograph Mars. They took images of the landscape there and stumbled upon a newly forming mesa or butte. Once NASA brought the images back and analyzed them. They found that the Face was nothing more than a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that made it look like a face.\n \n Then, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the region again. They snapped several pictures of it, at a ten times higher resolution, I might add, and analyzed these new images. They finally put their images on the internet and revealed to the world, that the Face was nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n Finally, in 2001, NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor a second time to photograph the Face. The team at NASA used the highest possible resolution to photograph this controversial piece of Mars. They found that the picture shows the, \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,\" which are are also found in the American West. NASA's chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program says,\" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\"\n \n Some people think that the Face provides evidence for life on Mars becasue NASA could not get a good shot of it.

Yet, NASA has proven over and over again that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation.\n \n The Face is nothing more than a natural landform and not an alien formation.

The face was nearly two miles in diameter and it appearded to be staring back at the cameras from an area of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some say that this is evidence of life on Mars.\n \n In paragraph 2, they tell us that the sensation was short lived. It also says that scientists assumed it was just another Martian Mesa because it was so common around Cydonia. This one had shadows that made is look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The photos revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument. If there really was an alien monument to begin with, it surely would have appeared the second time around, especially because they used a much better camera.\n \n In paragraph 12, it says that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin states that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars is most likely a natural landform. Martian mesas are common around the Cydonia area so it could have easily been mistaken for what appeared to be a human face. They claim to have seen evidence of life based on shadows that appeared on a natural landform. This seems very unrealistic.

    Essay: "A butte and a mesa these are all natural things on our planet Earth. So why do you think that the planet Mars also can't have these things. Earth is covered in these mesas so more than likely other planets including Mars probably have buttes and mesas, its just coincidentall that it looks like a face. With the other pictures it proves that the mesa isn't an alien artifact and just a natural landform.\n \n If you go out to the Rocky Mountains and look around you can probably see tons of Mesas maybe not as big ,but they are still the same natural landform. The mesa is big and does look like a face at first glance ,but there is no way you can prove it. But for scientists you can back it up with facts not just opinions.\n \n If you look at the image taken from the spaceship Viking 1 from 1976 you can see that only looks somewhat similar to a face. And then 22 years later a picture from a Mars Global surveyor you can see that it very clearly isn't a face and instead just a natural landform.\n \n The only way that this could be an alien artifact is if the martians are inside of it or underneath it. That would explain how the camera can not see any other buildings around the object because they are all inside of it so no one is outside. They also could be inside of the butte because the planet is deadly for some paticular reason and they have shelter inside safely away. And another reason is because inside of the planet there may be some source of running water that is keeping them alive.\n \n Although this could not work because they more than likely would have gotten a picture of a martian outside doing something. And they would need some source of water which has already dried up on the outside of the planet.\n \n In the end it is not possible that the mesa is an alien artifact and is instead just a butte or a mesa that happens to like a face. Because the clearer picture shows that it now looks nothing like a face, water stopped flowing on the red planet a long time ago, and Earth also has these land forms all over the place.",

The pictures show cracks that may appear to look like a face but really isnt.\n \n When a scientist was taking a picture on mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cyndonia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looking back at him. Another thing is that i dont think they seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture cant always be true because of how people crop pictures today.\n \n So these are my reasons why i think that that face is not really a face, just a natural landform. A lot of people may believe what thay want to believe. Just remember that eveybody has there own opinion.",

    Essay: "I know that the Face is a natural landform. I know for sure it was not made by aliens because aliens do not exist. We do not have a trace of alien lifeforms in our solar system. The Face was shaped into that form 25 years ago. We do not have proof that the Face was made by aliens. What it actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West. Even though Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it did shoot a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Mara Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. A person said \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Scientists say that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters,compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. They said if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.",

    Essay: "NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's \"sister\" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that \"so called aliens\" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there.\n \n One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.\n \n That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. Notice photo two? Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars.\n \n If you still do not believe me, then this next part will. If you think about it, why would NASA keep an amazing discover like this a secret? The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their \"face\" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.\n \n In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their \"face\", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.",

This mean its not as easy just to pop up and see it. meaning theres a possiblity thats not it because it wouldn't of been that easy to find.\n \n Second, most scientists think it was an alien. In the story it says\" Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at tge REd PLanet in sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the viking missionsended\". which means they never know what it is it can be a alien or an face but most likely just an alien in their case.\n \n Last , you dont just see pass the face any other time.

    Essay: "What is the reason why there is a face shape in Mars? No one know how it become a human face or if it a human face at all, and some think the reason behind it is that there are evidence showing live in Mars. I agree that the shape is a human face shape, but I also believe is just a landform. The reason is that as it stated in the article, the face is to attrack the people. As Technology improved, the picture are showing the real image of the face which reveal to change it shape.\n \n The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money. According to paragraph three it said that,\"huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head... formed by shadowss giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth.\" Following the evidence is that also on paragraph three it say,\" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to enage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" This evidence tell me that with the idea of having a human face in Mars, it allowed people to think and believe what they told them.\n \n On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,\" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"The second reason is that the face was due to a land form. The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State. We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms. Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change.\n \n There may be live in Mars, and no one know that is true. In any case the Face of Mars might looked like a real human face, but if you look closely at the face that viking take in 2001, it doesn't look like a face. In the picture it show how the landform change it, and that the reason for why there are no Face in Mars. This argument will show you why the Face of Mars is just any landform like you see in earth.",

    Essay: "Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.\n \n Strangley, the author of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\"\n \n suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was \"a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,\" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.\n \n Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?\n \n All in all, there is no \"true\" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what \"face\" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, \"Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.\" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.\n \n On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was. For instance, in the text the author stated, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West,\" and, \" Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.\" With all this said, the Face could have a slight chance of being real life; however, it is highly unlikely that it is true life on another planet.\n \n Ultimately, the Face shown on Mars is just a nautral landform. The Face cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence. All in all, life is changing all around us. New technoloy is being formed, but with a new generation who is ready to show the world what really is in the solar system. The future is in your hands. Find out what is next.

    Essay: "The Face on Mars is a natural landform, though, some may think that it was created by aliens. NASA's research has shown otherwise. The Face was not made by aliens, but under natural circumstances. There were many high quality pictures of this landform taken and many scientist who studied them. Scientist have come to conclusion that the Face is just a natural landform that has taken a not so natural shape.\n \n Many people still believe that the Face is some sort of acient alien monument. These conspiracy theorists think that NASA is just trying to hide the evidence of life on Mars. As said in the article \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" (Unmasking the Face on Mars). Believers were still skeptical so, to be sure, NASA took more pictures of the Face that were clear to the eye. With these new high resolution pictures, as Garvin said, \"you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" Basically, if there were life on Mars we would be able to see even the smallest of things through these photographs. There was nothing unusal found.\n \n For 25 years conspiracy theorists have been questioning NASA's research. Specifically, on Mars and whether or not there is alien life on it. There have been movies and books that fanticize on the things that could possibly be living on the Red Planet. These theories are not backed up by knowledge and facts like NASA's. NASA's scientist are the best of the best when it comes to knowing abot outer space. These scientist have seen Mars, and the Face, in person. Most of the theorist have never left the planet. Lastly, there are many natural landforms like the Face on our own planet. An example of this is, Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho as pointed out by Jim Garvin.\n \n Outer space is the home to many mysteries bu, the fact that the Face is a clue to alien civilation isn't one. Even though the landform looks as if it could a ruin of a acient alien civilization, the facts have shown that it is not. Through studying the pictures and positioning of the Face, NASA's professionals were able to conclude that it was just a natural landform much like the ones found here on Earth. This does not mean that there is no life on Mars, it just means that the Face is not a hint to finding it.",

During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.\n \n The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, \"Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia...\" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.\n \n On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.\n \n Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,\" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.\n \n In conclusion, the picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa. I believe that this was an amazing discovery and gave us, NASA scientist, a challenge to go out and find evidence to prove conspiracy theorists's accustuations.",

The people who do think that this is an alien made landform have not done as much of the research to figure it out, since they do not have the same high technology equiptment that NASA has. Many people think that the Face was made by aliens, but I believe that it is naturally formed, and it just happens to look like a face.\n \n There is no real evidence stating that aliens are real, or that they have ever existed. There has been research done, but no clear evidence that they are real, leading to the conclusion that most people think that they are not real. The Face, to some researchers, looks like what is similar to a mesa or butte. This is a natural landform that looks like a landform you would typically find around the American West. The differences in the pictures over the years help explain why the Face is not alien made.\n \n The pictures over the years change gerastically. In 1976, the picture is pretty blurry, looks smooth, and almost resembles a face on a statue. In 1998, the picture looks a little more like itself, a little rougher, and it does not resemble a face as much as the first picture. Lastly, the picture in 2001 looks more like a landform and is a little rough, but it is a much clearer picture than the other two. The last picture still resembles a face almost, but I believe that that is just a coincidence. NASA did plenty of research on the Face.\n \n NASA has done a lot of research on the Face to prove if there is life on Mars or not. The Face was found by one of NASA's spacecrafts called the Viking 1, which was taking pictures of possible landing spots for the other spacecraft, Viking 2. They let the picture out to the public, which got really popular really fast. The Face was really popular for 25 years! After those 25 years, they decided to get a better picture of the face. The picture turned out to be ten times sharper than the original photos. The pictures showed that the photo was a landform. Some of the scientists were not satisfied, and had to get a better photo, which still showed that the Face was just a landform.\n \n The Face was a natural landform on Mars that happened to look like a face. Although many believe that it was created by aliens, the evidence shows that it is just a landform. The three pictures that were taken help compare and tell us why it was not alien made. There is no evidence stating that aliens are real, so it is not a valid conclusion to state that aliens created the landform.

So far that is the best theory NASA has on what the object is.\n \n In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" whilst reading throught the fifth paragraph, they quote that defenders of NASA's budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars. This made me wonder why they would think that. It's because it would be more than just a landform like a mesa. They would have more to look into than just a face looking terrain. But being scientists they realized it was not as much as they'd hoped for. Therefore having no reason to lie about the mesa.\n \n However putting myself in the shoes of a person who wouldn't know about all these facts or opinions, I could see why these beliefs are taken seriously.

    Essay: "You and your friends and family could often have arguments on whether something is real or not, such as in movies. Some might think one thing is special effects, others will think it is real. In Unmasking the Face on Mars, the author explains controversy of the \"face\" found on Mars' surface. It became an icon once it was released to the public. It was highlighted for decades and the society argued over it being an alien making, or just a land form called a mesa. The face was just a natural landform and it shouldn't have been thought as an alien form.\n \n The most logical answer to this was that it was a mesa, and that the shadows on the surface happened to make it look like a human face of an egyptian pharaoh. This struck civilization in the late 70s and caused a lot of arguments. The people that thought is actually was an alien structure were just people of the press who just wanted attention. A Mars Global Surveyor \" snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared an a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" This quotes directly states and gives evidence that it is just a natural landform.\n \n There isn't even any true or logical evidence that the face on Mars was an \" alien artifact.\" It was just a rumor that went around to keep things interesting and intrigue big movie companies. The cameras even took a picture with a ten times better resolution than the 1976 picture of the face. In addition, the new picture even had each pixel in the image span 1.56 meters in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel. Garvin talks that \" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" and that \" if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" Garvin directly states here that no matter what, the formation couldn't have possibly been an alien formation or even a pyramid. This is even more proof that it is ridiculous to think that the formation was an \" alien making .\"\n \n Although the face was thought to be alien, there is too much evidence that denies it, and that it isn't. Scientists would wish that it was an extra terrestrial sign, but the odds of that are too scarce to even consider. This was a very controversial topic, as I have stated before. All of the theorists out there had many different and unique opinions of it. The narrator says what the image \" actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landfroms common around the American West. \" It remeinds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Garvin.\" This evidence gives even further support that it isn't extra terrestrial, and states that it isn't, shich exposes that it is a fluke.\n \n The face on Mars was an ongoing argument for years to come once it was released to the public. There was no reason to do so. There was already valid points that gave proof of it being just a mesa. Things like this occurence happen all the time, even in your daily life. If things like this run across your mind, think about it the logical way and not a very, very unlikely path about it. There may be similarities between the sides, like in this argument. But, there was too much to show that it favored the more realistic side of it. The passage has multiple occurences where it directly states just that.",

    Essay: "The Face on Mars was not made from an ancient alian civilization. We have proof of this because our cameras are ten times sharper than the cameras we had to orginally photograph the face, the shadows just create an illusion that the formation is a face, and the Face on Mars has been confirmed to just be a mesa.\n \n The first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras. The photo is blurry and unclear, not a very reliable source to base alien belief on. Even the photo in 1998, \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking phtos.\" Compare the photo from 1976 to the photo taken in 2001. The 2001 photo clearly shows that the Face on Mars is in fact not a face at all. Any belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens should now be wiped away because of how clearly the photo shows that the Face is just a landform.\n \n When the original photos were taken in 1976, there was the illusion that there was a face staring right back at the Viking 1. Shadows around the Face created this illusion that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. When the 1976 photo was released for people to see, the caption read, \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Even the experts immediately recognized the Face on Mars as just a natural landform with shadows.\n \n Though some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars.\n \n Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa.",

    Essay: "Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens?\n \n How can you believe that the face on Mars was aliens? it is obviously just another landform of Mars'. Here, i'll go through some evidence that it is just a landform.\n \n First of all, landforms like that are common in Cydonia. Also, keep in mind that appearances can be decieving. You can even see a similar landform right by the \"face\". And plus, there is no scientific evidence of life on another planet, let alone Mars. Simply stating that a haze could've hid the \"alien\" markings is hardly a compelling argument.\n \n Second off, The photo they took in 2001 proves even further that it just a normal martian messa. and accourding to the article that have read, \"you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" if you want to check this article out, you can find that information in paragraph 11. so if there were any alien objects, you could both see what they were and even know what they were.\n \n I think i have proven my point. so don't even try to argue that, you will not succeed. i know that you might say, well NASA is just lying. My response is that if you had the money to afford a satellite and you sent there, with the current high grade cameras, you would find that you were wrong all along. so yes I win this argument, and that the \"face\" on Mars is just a messa.",

Is it still possible for there to be aliens on the planet, maybe. We could go back to the planet and see if there is any evidence of alien life forms now.\n \n The face on Mars is formed from wind blowing dirt and sand around, pileing it up and packing it together. Now it just so happened that it managed to form a face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Now is this a strnge thing to have happen, yes it is indeed but it still happened all on its own.

Many people dont agree that it's just landform that built it's self up and just happened to resembul a face. Others would disagree and say that it is just land and that shodows were the main purpose of the enitre thing that made it look like a face. Why did the face on mars not look the same in 1976 i looked like a smilly face at first.\n \n When the picuture was taken it was taken in many different angles. That shows that there is a posability that the picture that they took at the time was in a way that made it have shadows an some sides. The camara that took it could have been faceing in the direction that the sun was shining and got some of the light make shadows on the landform.\n \n The scientist that looked at the picture taken by Viking 1 says it was only landform shaped in different ways.

Garvin says that it remindes him of a lava dome around the America West it's about the same height as the face that they found on mars.\n \n When they first took a picture of the face in 1976 it looked nothing like a face it only looked like a smily face and even that was hard to tell. After a couple of years in 1998 in looked like an oval shaped box and it was sunken in.

    Essay: "Switching Sides\n \n Have you ever heard of the man on the moon? Well Mars has a similar thing. They both ,at the time, had formations that looked like human faces. Some think it was made by aliens or some other superior being. However, the reality of it is that its just a natural formation that looks like a face. That part can be nocked out when you zoom up on it. The lines and basic formation of the mesa,the face, are too natural to be made by an intelligent species. Finally, if there was some marks or sign that it was created by aliens it would have shown up on the image due to the high resolution. We are looking farther then we should with this natural formation.\n \n At the moment the most recent picture from 2001 completly exterminates any facial recognition. You can see natural lines that run across the mesa and the higher elevation of certian areas. The eyes are just a steep hill that geos to the top. While the mouth seemingly isn't even there anymore. You can see the worn away parts indicating that its been there for quite awhile. The shadows aren't even there at the time which creates the distictive features. It bearly even looks like a face anymore.\n \n I was talking about the NATURAL lines that appear on the mesa. The lines on the mesa are to distictive to be created. If something made it they would have wanted smooth edges as well as an even ditch. If they tried to recreate the natural look it would have looked faulty and unbeliveable. The species would have completly deformed the hill exposing its true colors. Also what reason would they have for creating a random face with the possibility of no one ever seeing it. There is no point to it.\n \n Finally, the final reason for it not being alien-made is if there was marking on the mesa giving reason to believe it was created be aliens they would have been shown. If any wierd symbols showed up on the screen we would have seen it and still release the image. Why would we hide this from the world if it would increase the amount of funding we get from companies. You can study the image for hours, but not find a single symbol anywere on the image. The camera would have picked it up and we would have studied it.\n \n The mesa was not created by aliens if only looks that way to us because are minds are hardwired to find faces. Its much easier to remember a face rather than a name. Everything about the image is natural it wasn't put there for some unnoticable reason that we can't comprehend. It just existis thats all... nothing more nothing less. No aliens had anything to do with this mesa.",

    Essay: "In 1976, a remarkable natural landform was discovered on Mars, a land form known now as, The Face. Scientist have debated on whether The Face is a natural landform or created by an ancient civilization on Mars. I believe this is really just a natural landform, and the reason I believe this is because of recent evidence. Reasons why I support this are, in 1976 picture quality wasn't as advanced as it is today and, this rock formation is similar to ones that occur on Earth.\n \n The Face, a huge rock formation, at nearly two miles long. This face like formation is also known as Cydonia. Cydonia in the mid 70's was thought to be a strange landform built by aliens. Although, really it's like any other naturally occuring landform on Earth. According to the artical \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" In the new updated picture of The Face, it is clearly seen as a land formation, not done by aliens.\n \n Then in 1976 picture of Cydonia was not as advanced as it is today. In the 2001 pictures, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo.\" This quote from paragraph 10 explains that, the picture power was very noticable different in the photograph from 1976 than 2001. This means that the pictures from 1976 are not reliable because of the poor pixel quality. Proving that The Face is just a natural landform.\n \n On April 5th, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor traveled to Mars and flew over Cydonia for the first time. These photos were said to be \"...ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,\" according to the artical.\n \n So on that day in 1998 people tuned in to find out the real truth. A quote from paragraph 7 in the artical states, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitng when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.\" In the end, it turns out that there was really no alien monuments.\n \n In conclusion, my claim is that The Face is just a naturally occuring landform. First, are Earth landforms that are similar, called mesas. Next, pictures took in 1976, are outdated and have poor pixel quality. Lastly, since April 5th, 1998 there are pictures proving that The Face is just a natural landform. Therefore making my claim true, The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform.",

It is either a human being or alien possibly inside of this planet with their face sticking out perminately.

As viking one took pictures, it came across a pecuiliar formation on the surface of the planet. The formation seemed to be an enormouse head similar to that of a humans. The scientist figured it was just another Martioan mesa, that was commonly spread throught the surface of Mars.\n \n Conspiracy theorists think that it is bona fide evidence that there is life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acncient civilization on Mars. And so on April 5, 1998 another Mars global surveyor flew over and took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. This led the the scientist to conclude and reveal that the face was just a natural land form and that it wasn't an alien monument at all.\n \n Some people were not happy. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. This was a coudy time of year on Mars. They had said that the camera the pictures had been taken with had to peer through clouds to see the Face. They believed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze at the time.\n \n On April 8, 2001, there was a cloudles day on Mars. The surveyor drew close for another picture. They said they increased the image quality to take the best picture they had taken of the face. They added that in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixle size you could see things like airplains, egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks.\n \n This showed people that it was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. This showed that the conspiracy theorists had been proven wrong. Since NASA actually researches theier data to learn more about it and they make hypothesize, it shows that they have a lot of since in saying that theorists are wrong. Theorist just make theories and they don't have anything to back them up if someone were to arugue about the subject. Conspiracy theorists are not always wrong but in this case they are.",

Now, since NASA is doing their reasearch they probably have a more than likely chance of being correct they've actually studied the object to see what it actually was. While these conspiracy theorist go with the common opinion about it floating around, and do no reasearch at all. The conspiracy theorists think that may NASA is hiding the fact that aliens have made this from the public because it may harm their budget. Taking this to 1976, camera resolution wasn't high enough to take good high quality photos yet because the technology was behind. The picture was blurry and it was one of those, \"you've got to see it to believe it\" moments because nothing could be made out from it. This is probably where that \"aliens made this\" conspiracy came from, the photo is so blurry looks as though some sort of alien space craft had landed here or the doing of aliens for artwork. Now, when you fast forward to 2001, you can obviously see more clarity in the picture. It almost looks as though this could be some alien artwork, but this is more than likely just a from a ship that has landed there and made this odd face like hole. Furthermore, if this was created by aliens it would be far more complex and wonderful than a face.\n \n In closing, this \"face on Mars\" and the fact that it may have been created by aliens could be true. But reason rules this out, these faces are just a natural landform that were there from the beginning, human created, or were made from a landing ship.",

I must say that the first picture in 1976 looks a lot like an alien, but we have gotten better technology and the newest pictures show it is just a monument.

When they find real life outside our atmosphere they get paid for all the research they've done.\n \n Then there's the rumors that certain people spread around.

Brian Games had a show about faces, and it said that you can see an object and make it look human or make it look like a face, such as a specific flower that might look like a face. This is what those scientists are doing in this very situation. They are mistaking a natural made land form on Mars as an alien build face. There are many ways this landform could have been made. It could have been made by wind and rocks blowing across what you could say is a landscape. As you can see from the landform is that it has faided away over time and now looks like a lump of sand, which wouldn't you think if aliens made that they would fix it up and make it look like a face again?

Although some believed the face was a sign of alien life, others were not as easily convinced.\n \n The first picture was taken in 1976 when technology was not very great. So in 1997\n \n NASA 's Mars Exploration Program chief scientist, Jim Garvin decided he'd try to get another photo. On April 8, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the site again. Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture that was, \"Ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,\" the article says. But other conspiricy theorists think otherwise.\n \n The article mentions that the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. It was apparently winter there in April of '98. Skeptics say, \"Perhaps alien markings were hidden by the haze.\" Garvin says, \"Targeting Cydonia was not easy...in fact it is hard to work.\" Mars Global Surveyor noramally looks straight down but in order to get a good picture, they would have to actually move the camera 2.5 km. They also do not pass over the face very often.\n \n On April 8, 2001 they attempted another picture. This time the picture was perfect. It was a cloudless day in Cyndonia. \"The team had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view.\" Garvin said. Not easy work. The article also mentions that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photos. I think that this picture did really prove that the Face was only a landform and not some kind of martian marking.\n \n In the end people came to relize that the Face on Mars was really on a butte or a mesa of some sort. Garvin says, \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground...you could have seen what they were.\" I personally do not think the Face is part of ancient Martian life but as Garvin says, \"It reminds me of most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.\" I hope now that the others that once believed in the face now relize it really was only their imagination.",

    Essay: "If it was an object created by aliens then why would they turn that landform into a human face. There have never been any reports of someone coming close to an alien face to face. Also how would the aliens know what humans look like, they have never even been to earth before. All that face is, is a rock with shadows from the sun to make illusions to the human eye.\n \n The face was used in grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Yes, you may think think aliens did it and there is a chance they did, but that chance is very slim. yes, some scientist did believe it was an alien artifact but that was before they had HD cameras and now we can see the rock clearly. Garvin said that \"If there were objects in that picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were\".\n \n In conclusion, there is no evidence that aliens have created that face and if there was, NASA would do all that it could to prove it a farce. Do not believe everyhting you see online or in books. You might just become too attatched to that topic.",

    Essay: "Have you heard of the Face on Mars? It is said to be two miles from top to bottom. What do you think formed this? Aliens? An acient civilzation? Out of all of the possible answers, I say it is just a natural landform with shadows that causes it to have a nose, eyes, and mouth.\n \n Paragraph ten and eleven of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" As rule of thumb, you can discern in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he added. \"So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\" This leads me to belive that there is nothing but that natural landform on the Face of Mars. With these images it says you can see the tiniest thing as a shack, so I am positive that we would see any evidence that aliens were there.\n \n The landform actually shows the Martian eqivalent to buttle or mesa----landforms common around the American West. This face on the surface of Mars resembles many of those on the Earth, which we know were not created by aliens. \"\"It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain in Idaho,\" says Gravin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\" These lines in paragraph twelve show that there is another landfrom, on Earth, that has formed out of natural causes such as lava. The Face on Mars could just simlpy be lava that has caused the surface to rise.\n \n Many conspiracy therorists say that it could be aliens and NASA is just trying to hide the evidence form the people. Yet in paragrpah five it states, \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" This shows that if this was caused by aliens, that it would be benifical to NASA. Few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, but there was no actual proof that it was. There were only pictures that clearly showed that there were no signs of aliens.\n \n Although this Face on Mars is a big deal, I believe that it is just a natural landform. Images that have been taken show no sign of aliens or ancient civilizations. There are also many landfroms on Earth just like this Face on Mars. Last but not least, the theory that NASA is keeping information from us is not true because the Face actually being aliens or an acient civilization would only benifit them. All of these reasons is why I belive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform.",

    Essay: "I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical. And, to prove my point, I have conjured a few reasons as to why this \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform.\n \n Firstly, the picture taken in 2001 is solid proof, as well as the 1998 picture. Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked.\n \n Also, I will point out that, in 1976, we at NASA were still relatively new to venturing beyond Earth's orbit. The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was.\n \n My final claim that the Face on Mars is a mesa lies in the fact that, if the Face really was an alien monument, NASA would not keep their lips tight about it. It would make global headlines, and shock the world. I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.\n \n Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens. Thank you for your time and effort in reading this essay.",

    Essay: "Do you think that the Face on Mars is a natural landform, or do you think that it was created by aliens? The picture of the Face on Mars was captured on May 21, 2001, and a few days later it was shown to the public which got this whole thing started. Most of the people from NASA believed that it was just a natural landform, but conspiracy theorists believed the it was created by aliens on Mars. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper to reveal a natural landform. It was just a huge rock formation which resembled a human face, and the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars because they would benefit off of it.\n \n A few days after the photo of the Face was snapped, they showed it to the public for everbody to see. The NASA team caption the photo with \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" Some people believe that the Face was created by aliens on Mars. NASA and many scientists believed that it was just another Martian Messa. Martian Messas were common enough around Cydonia.\n \n On April 5, 1998, The MOC team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. The photo first appeared on the JPL web site, and it revealed a natural land form. Since the Face was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, it was winter at the time they snapped the picture which was in April of 1998. At this time, it was cloudy on the planet Mars, so the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Conspiracy theorists said that maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.\n \n Lastly, the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was ancient civilization on Mars. If aliens did exist and NASA did discover them or signs of them, then NASA would benefit off of it. NASA would most likely send people or some kind of camera to take better pictures and videos of Mars. NASA would not keep it to themselves, they would share it with the public. After all this time survaying and taking pictures of Mars, they have not found alien life form on Mars.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform like many others. The Face just happens to be unique because of it's many shadows that make the Face resemble an actual face. Many rock formations happen on the planet of Mars. The Face is no different then the many thers of it's kind. The Face is the most unique and interesting landform found on Mars the is one of the many natural landforms presents on the planet Mars.",

Right? Next I'm going to tell more facts that it was not an alien that create the human face on mars.\n \n When globa surveyor came in Sept. 1997 they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot of the face. Micheal Malin went to mars he took hs team and a camera that too ten times sharper than the orignal camera they took it with before. When they uploaded the picture all NSA found was landforms . Their is no such thing as aliens mountment. Some people were not impressed with this answer and cause it was located differntly in the winter time and alein maring might of been hidden by the haze. The MGS team even went out there again with a cloudless summer day and was 25 degrees in the center of the face and even used a different camera again and made it bigger and sharper.

In paragraph 7 it stated, \"...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" Malin and his team took sharper pictures to prove to other people that they were right about it being a natural landform. Scientists also haven't seen anything like this before. In paragraph 9 it mentioned, \"We just donÂ’t pass over the Face very often.\" If it really was an alien you would see more things like this because there wouldn't be just one alien, there would way more, causing there to be more faces. More scientists also believed that the Face was a natural landform, while only a few believed it could have been an alien feature. Within paragraph 8 it stated, \"But not everyone was satisfied... Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" By the article saying this, they showed that some people disagreed with the other scientists, and actually thought it was some sort of alien marking.\n \n Although, most of the scientists say that this is a natural landform, there will always be someone who wants to disagree with them.

    Essay: "There are still some disputes about the true \"identity\" and origin of the Face on Mars. It is most likely just a natural landform, but some people disagree. Some people believe that it was created by aliens. However, since there is no legit proof of aliens even being real, how could you prove that they did this? NASA also has high-resolution photographs that make it pretty clear that it's just a natural landform. It may have taken several tries to collect all of the needed data to back this up, but the scientists did it so now we know.\n \n As I briefly mentioned before, there is no proof of alien life actually existing. So, then, why are people convinced that it was aliens? Yes, it may have a strange shape, but that doesn't mean anything. There are strange shaped things here on Earth but people don't accuse it of being alien. Now, I do understand that this is in space, and on a different planet, but still; there are way more logical explanations. It's normal for there to be landforms on planets. That's simply the deal here.\n \n The scientists also collected high-resolution photos of the Face. When the best photo was taken in 2001, it was made clear that this was just a landform, similar to some in the American West. It was just a formation that looked suspicious from far away. If you looked at the zoomed in picture, it just looks like a jumble of rocks. People just need to think realistically.\n \n There is, however, a couple small reasons why people see a possibility of this being done by aliens. One of the pictures was taken from behind a small wispy cloud. This gave some people enough reason to believe that there could be alien markings hidden by the haze. Another reason people have for believing this is extraterrestrial work is that there have been some unexplainable sightings and findings that may point to alien life existing. There is no actual facts or proof, but enough has happened without logical explanations to convince certain people of this theory.\n \n I respectfully refute these points. The idea of alien markings being hidden is a stretch. There was an even clear picture taken more recently that showed no alien markings. It proved that it was just a landform. There's really not that much more to it. In response to the few unexplainable things that may point to alien life, we have no way to tell what's really out there. If there is something, then it's doing a pretty good job of staying hidden, or undiscovered because we have no cold, hard proof of anything. For some things there are just no logical answers. There's always going to be something we don't know. It's probably the most reasonable to just stick to the facts we already have, and learn to accept the most likely stories. Yes, it's okay to believe or hope that there is something out there, but people should also realize that they need to think reasonably in certain matters, especially when there's proof, like in this case.\n \n This is a very strong argument. There are many ways that a person could keep going on and on, explaining each detail to its full extent, but I think all the most important information has already been mentioned. People should accept the facts. There is always going to be someone who disagrees, but every argument is like that. There is way more proof pointing to the conclusion that the Face is just a landform. You might still think something different, but I think I've made it clear why I have so much reason to believe what I believe.",

NASA revealed the images of this \"face\" thinking that it would be a good way to attract attention to mars. It worked too, maybe not in the way NASA had hoped though. This \"face\" caused many people to belive that it was proof that there is or was life on Mars.\n \n NASA explains this \"face\" formation on Mars as a Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â” Many skeptics believe that this \"face\" is proof of life forms on Mars and that NASA is just trying to cover it up. Although if this was proof of life forms on Mars then that would greatly benefit NASA so why would they try and cover it up? Well the answer is they wouldnt. If there was any proof that there was life forms on Mars then NASA would benefit greatly and they would most likely reveal that to the public as well, not hide it.\n \n So what is this \"Face of mars\" that has had so many people questioning NASA and skepticizing over whether or not there is life on Mars? Well, the latest picture was an MGS image from 2001. This image shows the \"Face\" for what it actually is, which is a mesa. As it says in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" Â“ThatÂ’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.Â”\n \n This lattest image has been able to show us what the rock land form on Mars actually is. Which is just a mesa. Slowly since the image from the NASA Viking 1 in 1976 we have been getting better and better quality images. With these better quality images we are able to see that this rock land form on Mars doesnt even really look like a face. Slowly the pictures have gotten less hazy and we have been able to better see the \"face.\"\n \n When you look back on that first image, the one from the Viking 1space ship in 1976 its easy to say that the land from on Mars looks like a face. Because it does look like a face in that first bad quality image, but now that we have new technology with better photo taking abilities it is easy to see that what we once may have thought looked like a face. Is just a mesa on Mars. Not proof that there is aliens, or other life forms on Mars. Just a Mesa, that in all reality doesnt actually look all that much like a face.",

    Essay: "The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. Through advancements in digital imagery, an understanding of shadows, and an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, it can be concluded that the face on mars is just a myth.\n \n Today, we humans have the access to cameras with spectacular resolution. When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.\n \n Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This excerpt from the article explains that the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.\n \n While many conspiracy theorists would still like to believe that aliens created this face on the moon, they are mistaken. With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found. However, others still argue.\n \n Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms. The article mentions, \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars.\" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information.\n \n So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.",

I will provide simple facts that everyone will be able to understand and hopefully help you see that the face on Mars is nothing but a landfom created by natural causes.\n \n When the first picyure of the \"Face\" came out on the Viking 1, the small indents and the shadow angle showed what looked like a human face but was actually just one of the many mounds that for there. The United Staes actually has mounds of lava that had formed NATURALY in Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\n \n Many people believe that if it is used for advortizement that is is a real true fact and they can believe that what ever is on that buildboard or sign on the highway that has had or is going to happen. The Face of Mars has been used for marketing for over 25 years so it would sell more item to the population and the buisness CEO's would make more money.\n \n People also believe in one picture on a cloudy day that they could see markings on the mound that would show that Martians have been and built the Face, but on a cloudlaess summer day in 2001 we captured a picture of the mound with our new and improved cameras that spans 1.5 meters compared to the 43 meter camera that the Viking used. The newer camera can discren things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,so we could see if there was anything on the mound that would show living things on the planet Mars",

Well yes it would. Unless it were like a carnival and it travled around. But it was a giant rock. In this paper im going to prove to you that this face was not made by \"aliens\".\n \n Twenty five years ago we found what looked like a face on mars. We didnt know if this were something caused by aliens or just something that was natural. Well that was untill we came back to take more pictures of this so called \"face\". We came back around twenty two years later. Just to find out we caught the face at the right time when we took the first picture. We found out the picture was takin in winter on the planet and it was a cloudy day.\n \n But it has to be alein life form that created this. They can easely destroy what they make. us humans do it all the time. And why would you guys at NASA put something like this out in the world for people to see? If it wasnt real life on anouther planet. Do you like playing games with us.\n \n So we also know that there is no life on mars because we have cameras that can capture the smallest of sheds. On camera so if we saw a little house on the camera we would think there is life on this plante for sure(11). at NASA we didnt know exactly what caused that face at the time. We realeased it so we could sow you guys we may have found something. Now we have proven that we didnt find anything. We can also tell you the \"Aliens\" didnt destroy anything because this rock is still there.\n \n This artilcle was givin to you to prove that aliens didnt cause this \"face\". We know that there are no aliens on mars. Here in 2016 we have rovers up on mars we know nothing is up there. I was using the article to prove my theroy up above. and how could you think that a giant face is caused by aliens? People. I dont know what goes through there mind sometimes.

    Essay: "I think that the face on mars was made simply by nature and I think that it couldn't have been made by aliens. The reason that the face was made is just by lava that has made it into that form. The shape it is in is just a coincidince and it is truly one of a kind.\n \n The alien's markings were not there we proved that when Michael Malin and his \"Mars Orbiter Camera\" snapped a photo 10 times sharper and it was proven that the face was not an alien made feature but instead a landform beautifully to be there from nature.\n \n Aliens couldn't have made this landform or we would've seen them in a camera that we set in space to take pictures of planets like Space Orbiters. When we saw the landform we immediatley took a picture of it. We had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in the feild of view. We took a photo as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\n \n In conclusion, this landform couldn't have been made by aliens because there is no alien's markings and there isn't even any proof that it could have been alien's makings. This landform is made completely by nature and it is a very neat attraction and we should admire it but remember that it wasn't made by aliens.",

My side is that the face on mars could be seen wrong, it could be a pile of rocks, and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens.\n \n So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either. First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible. It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face.

    Essay: "You may think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. That is not true. The Face is just a natural ladform. There is a lot of evidence to support my argument. Like it is simply just a mesa, the photo Malin took, and there are many similar landforms around the American West. Certainly it wasn't created by aliens!\n \n It is just a mesa. First, Martian mesas were common. They were very common around Cydonia as said in the article. Second, it did look like a face. That is because of the unusual shadows that formed to look kind of like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Third, it gives an illusion. The illusion is of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. These are the reasons that shows that the Face is a Martian mesa.\n \n Michael Malin's photo shows that it is a landform. First, Malin's photo was taken ten times sharper. It lets it have a more clear image. Second, people think that the alien markings were hidden by haze. Though on the second picture it still doesn't show any sign of alien markings. Third, on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. That day it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's tame captured a fantastic photo. It still didn't show that the Face was created by aliens. The photos that Malin and his team took were very useful.\n \n It is similar to the world in a way. Using photos of the Face they would be able to see if there was any sign of life. Like small homes, or shacks. Second, it is defenitly equivalent to a butte or mesa. There is so much information to prove that. Third, it has landforms in common around the American West.

    Essay: "The face look alike that was on Mars was not created by aliens. Many people may believe that but they might just want to belive that there are such things as aliens. The face was created by just landforms. Reasonings being is, MOC, or Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture, the NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get such an accurate photo, and people over the interent were making their own stories up to make it seem like there was an alien that made that.\n \n MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the face like rock. When they took a picture that was alot more accurate and sharper looking than what Viking's had taken, they were able to zoom in and look at more then just the face. The passage says, \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all.\" Which, since they ARE scientist, they have done their research on the picture and done as much looking into as they possibly could have.\n \n NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get an accurate photo. In the article it says, \"... Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" So, when the Viking's took the picture and the shadow was in it, it made it look something more than what the MOC had caught. The Viking's had no profesional camera to take that picture of the landform. Also, they were far away from the planet, they were circling it, so the shadow that they were seeing had to of been from something else. Or maybe from what they were even in.\n \n People over the internet were making their own stories up. In the article it states, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" Since people believe whatever they see on the interent, they had to of jumped to conclusions and people had to of been throwing out the idea of \"Oh! that has got to be made by an alien!\" so that's what people starting saying. The NASA reveiled th photo hoping it would bring attention to Mars, but that is sure what they got. But it was the atention that an alien had made the landform.\n \n So, with that being said, MOC had actual camera photage of the landform, NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get accurate pictures, and people over the internet were just trying to make it seem like an alien was real.

    Essay: "So you say the discovery of the face Cydonia that was founded in Mars back in 1976 was created by aliens. I seem to disagree with your argument. As we have done more research here in NASA back in 2001 each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 image which means with the new and more improved technology we got a closer and better resolution of the face Cydonia on Mars which you so think was created by aliens. The recent image of Cydonia from 2001 has better pixel quality so that we can zoom in more to see if there are any other objects other than Cydonia such as cars or houses in which we both know don't exist in the red planet. Cydonia has unusual shadows that make it resemble a human head with it giving us an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalent of a butte Mesa which are also landforms that are commonly found in the American West. So as you know that after the discovery, photographing Cydonia has became one of our main priority for us here at NASA to prove that it wasn't created by aliens. I hope that after you heard my side of the argument you have a different view of Cydonia as it formed by itself in the red planet.",

    Essay: "While most people believe the \"Face\" on mars was just a natural landform there are also people who believe it was created by aliens. Those people believed it was an alien artifact that was seen in the photograph taken above Mars by Viking 1 during 1946. But there are many peices of evidence that support the idea of the \"Face\" just being a natural landform.\n \n For starters, when the \"Face\" was first seen on Cydonia, Mars, it was photographed by Viking 1 on 1976, which during that time cameras weren't as powerful as cameras now so the picture quality back in 1976 was blurry compared to today's photos. The '' Face\" was actually just a Martian mesa which is a lava dome, which are common in Cydonia. Soon after, scientists concluded \" it was a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" And if the \"Face was actually created by aliens NASA wouldn't have told the public since it could've caused public panic, but instead NASA used the ''Face\" as a way to attract the public's attention towards Mars. So in the end, the \"Face\" did bring much attention to Mars which was NASA's intention.\n \n While conspiracy theorists believe the \"Face\" was real evidence of life on Mars, it was actually not, defenders of the NASA budget confirmed it when they said that they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Even when few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA. So on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Then, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a picture which was ten times sharper rhan the original Viking photos. And so, the Face was confimed by Micheal Malin and his Orbiter Cameria (MOC) team to just be a natural landform.\n \n But still again people were not content since the Face on Mars was located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998, which was a cloudy day. And so, the camera in the MGS had to take a photograph though clouds to see the Face which skepics still said \"alien markings were hidden by the haze.\" So once more, on April 8, 2001, which was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the MGS or the Mars Global Sirveyor grew closer until it was 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. The 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\n \n In conclusion, the photo taken on 2001, finally confirmed that the Face on Mars was really a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. So in the end, the Face was never created by aliens but it was just a natural landform.",

With today's technology we are able to see that it's just another landform on Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars was a great mystery and a degree of surprise back in 1976 since they were just exploring mars at the time and didn't really know what to expect from it when they found that landform. Since then the Face became a pop icon and stared in multiple Hollywood films, magazines, and books. Because of the landform on Mars people thought that is was solide evience that life was on mars or that there was life on Mars.

The photo was taken with maximum resolution, and when people saw the picture there was no mistaking it for a landform on Mars. Garvin also added \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" said Gravin.

We have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from the NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is. The Face is just a mesa created by natural landforms. I am sorry to tell you but aliens do not exist, we haven't found any evidence proving that aliens exist.\n \n Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet Mars taking some pictures of the possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking. While it was taking the pictures for the possible landing sites, something funny had happened, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face on the plant. It turned out to be an enormous head nearly two miles form end to end. No this was not created by aliens. Us scientist have been working as hard as we can to see how this \"Face\" was created. We haven't found anything about it being created by aliens. The Face is just a natural landform. Us scientist at NASA figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n A few days later us at NASA released the image to the public to see. The title of the image was \"huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head ... formed by shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" A few of us scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact, but it was talked about with the scientist of NASA and we decided that it wasn't created by aliens because there is no sign of life on Mars that we have found. On April 5, 1998, is when a Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera, also known as (MOC), team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The pictures revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no proof that it was created by aliens. Aliens do not exist they are just made up and scientists, like me, at NASA have never found evidence about aliens existing.\n \n Not everyone was satified with the picture. Everyone thought that the weather conditions were different because the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. Since it was winter in April '98, it was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board, MGS, had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face, so people thought that the photo that was taken was not a fair photo. The people wanted a fair photo that they could see in almost the same weather condtions. We gave people what they want and we went to look for it again. Mission controllers prepared to look again but it was not easy. The face is very hard to track and get a picture of. The Mars Global Surveyor on Apil 8, 2001, went to take another picture, and it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The spacecraft had to be 25 degrees to center the Face. Each pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel, but when it was compared to he 2001 image it spans 1.56 meters. The picture was easier to look at and they got a closer view. They came to the conclusion of it just being a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the image from NASA, known as the Face, was not created by aliens. The image is just a natural landform. According to scientist, like me, at NASA there was no proof that the Face was not created by aliens. Thanks to the technology that we have it is very clear that the image is just a natural landform that created itself.",

The second piece of edivence is shadows, as you can see in the pictures it is just how the sun is position and how the statlite is postion to make it look like a face. The last reason is other natural sites that have the same size and looks like the face on Mars. The face on Mars reminds the Auroth of a place in Idaho. It is a Butte in the Snake river Plain. It is almost the same size and shape.\n \n In conclusion the face of Mars is a natural site, and not made by aliens. I know because of the picture of the face of Mars. The new technology we used to get a better look at it. Lastly how other natural sites look like the face of Mars.",

    Essay: "Is the Face on Mars real? In my opinion the Face on Mars is real. Here are my reasons why.\n \n The Face on Mars is real because it can be a natural landform on Mars just like we have natural landforms on Earth. Now may I ask a question? How can ailens make a face on Mars? In the picture provided, it seems the face pops out and there is no evidence that a creature could have made a face with no flaws. In the article, a webiste states \" thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.\"\n \n I understand that people may have a theory about the face, but hence the word theory. Theory is just a guess with evidence supporting the claim, but is there enough evidence to support the Face? People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape.\n \n How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face. The face could have been on Mars since Mars was created and NASA just never payed enough attention until 1976. I do not believe an ailen created the Face on mars.\n \n Is the face on Mars real? Keep that question in your head. I believe this essay has provided enough evidence proving the Fac on Mars is just a natural landform. That's just my opinion. What's your opinion?",

    Essay: "Some claim that a picture of a natural landmark and a shadow is really a sign of alien lifeform or a civilization. Nasa a billion dollar company dissagrees and has proof that this is indeed a landmark with a shadow and not any sort of alien life. That has not stopped some conspiracy theorists from saying that this is a cover up.\n \n Nasa as we all know is a company that is paid to fly unmanned and sometimes manned aircraft into the sky and most excitingly space. That is a positive thing for us humans who have no idea why we are here and how are we here. People don't like to know or believe the truth and sometimes make up lies or takes something the wrong way and make everyone from the news to the everyday household hear about something that didn't even turn out to be true. That is the same case here, Nasa released a photo of a mountain during a time of day that would have shadows, and Nasa being a public and government company is forced by law to release photos to the people. Which leads to more proof if Nasa took more photos that showed aliens or other inteligent lifeforms they would have to release it they can't just magicly hit erase.\n \n Conspiracy theorist still do not believe Nasa so they demand more photos and still Nasa has even more proof that this \"face'' is indeed a montain with shadows stratigicly placed to look like a human face. Theorist say that everything Nasa does is either faked or fixed to look like something it is not. In this case it went viral and many people still believe it was aliens that went there and did that but Nasa declines and this time Nasa has a little more proof.\n \n Nasa would've got money to send a human or a robot to Cydonia if it were a human lifeform or an alien, and we all know the team that worked on it would've got some pretty heavy paychecks just by working on the case, just imagine that checks the team would make if it were a civilivation. But Nasa will not be sending over humans or a robot for a couple reasons, the best reason is that the already know that this is just a mountain, not a civiliation.\n \n In conclusion Nasa knows this is a mountain and not a lifeform of any kind.\n \n Nasa also knows that lifeforms like ours can not survive on the surface of any planet without an atmousphere like mars. So even if a lifeform can survive without oxygen unlike us that the proof of that area says otherwise.",

    Essay: "NASA has done a lot of research on the planet we call Mars. Twenty-five years ago NASA's Viking one spacecraft was taking photos of landing sites for Viking two. They found a human face. Some say that this face was created by aliens. I think it is just a natural landform.\n \n First of all, mesas are common in Cydonia. As the text says, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.\" The shadows made it look like the landform had eyes, a nose, and a mouth. These are just shadows. Only afew Scientists thought that the Face was an Alien artifact.\n \n Secondly, they took pictures and said that the face was just a landform. After they first saw the face, they wanted to take pictures as soon as possible. NASA flew the Mars Global Surveyor over Cydonia. As the article says, \" Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos.\" That means those pictures were more accurate. These photos resulted that the Face was just a natural landform.\n \n Lastly, scientists said that it was the same as landforms around the American west. Mission controller, Garvin, said, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" This is showing that the landforms here, are on Mars. Aliens didn't make our landforms though. The Face is actually a mesa or a butte and not an Alien artifact.\n \n Some might say, that the second time, in 1998, the camera had to look through the clouds in order to see the face. This is true but, Mission control prepared to look again and went back in 2001. This time the camera had absolute maximum resolution. The text states that, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking Photo.\" This camera saw very clearly and saw that it was a mesa or a butte.\n \n In conclusion, scientists say the Face is just a landform. I agree with them and think that its just a landform. There are even pictures to prove that it was not an Alien artifact.",

    Essay: "The Face is a natural landform on Cydonia. Speculators doubt NASA, and say that the landform was created by aliens. Both of these claims have evidence to support their side. One side I believe has more evidence to prove their claim.\n \n The side that disagrees with the thought that the Face was made naturally, are called speculators. NASA has realeased information about the Face, but speculators think NASA is hiding something from them which is called bona fide. Since the very first trip to Cydonia, many people have been intreaged by the topic. As said in paragrapgh 5 , \"The Face has become a pop icon\". The idea that a face was on Cydonia made people think that there had to be a creator. The creators were aliens. The next time the Mars Orbiter Camera went to Cydonia, NASA claimed there were clouds blocking the veiw of the Face. This must have shown that NASA was hiding something. NASA also tried to say that they don't pass over the Face that often. Maybe NASA didn't people to find things out. All these peices of evidence put together must prove that aliens created the Face on Cydonia.\n \n Scientist from NASA can help prove the speculators wrong. Speculators assume that the Face couldn't have just been created over time. In paragrapgh 12, it states that there are similar landforms created, called mesa, in America. Next, the speculators say that there were clouds blocking the veiw of alien clues during the Orbit Camera journey. Since the clouds blocked the veiw of the planet, NASA sent another camera on clear day. In paragrapgh 10 and 11 it says the camera took the absolute maximum resolution. If there were any signs of anything strange the camera would have caught it. Speculators say that NASA wants to hide the fact that there were aliens. If there were aliens then that would help NASA's budget in future journeys. The evidence provided proves thay the Face was naturally created.\n \n After recieving both sides of the story. I support the NASA and the fact that the Face was naturally created. The speculators had their concerns about the legibillity of NASA. Speculators believed that NASA was hiding things. NASA respnoded to the critics and proved that there were no aliens. Plus, if there were aliens out there then that would help\n \n NASA with many things. Those are the reasons why I thing the Face was naturally created.\n \n The Face, on Cydonia, will stay a contreversial subject. There will be the speculators and doubters. There will be the supporters of NASA. Both sides have evidence to support their claims. I have picked my side. Now what will you choose?",

    Essay: "Have you ever seen or ever been on Mars? Most of you might have not, but studying Mars is a part of my job. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.\n \n My first reason is because aliens do not exist. There has been much research in this world to prove that aliens do not exist, but still some people believe that there are aliens. Whenever something weird happens in space, we always have to say aliens exist, and there is a lot of proof that they don't. On Mars, landforms can change, just like any other planet. For example, in 1976 it started out by looking like a bump. Then in 2001, it warped into many different shapes with cracks or ridges in it, and in the end it turned out looking like a face.\n \n My second reason is because NASA has proved that it is a natural landform. It says in paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they recieved the photo it revealed a natural landform. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. So, the Face was proved to be a natural landform in the end.\n \n My third reason is because the Face looks like landforms on Earth. In paragraph 12 it states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the Americian West.\" This tells us that the Face is common and not a shockingly new landform. Also, in paragraph 12 it says, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" So, the Face is obviously not a new thing, because Earth has a landform very similar to it. Landforms are made naturally and it takes many years to start noticing the changes in a landform.\n \n Some people might say that aliens are real and that over the years they have been working on this landform. They could also say that NASA rarely goes over the Face because it is so hard to find, so NASA never sees the aliens because of this reason. This is all true, except that aliens are real; there is no true proof of knowing if aliens are real or not, but they most likely aren't. Also, NASA has proved that the Face isn't a new landform, but that it is similar to many landforms on Earth.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.",

    Essay: "What is that thing on Mars?\n \n Well, some people believe that it was something made by aliens. I am here to prove that it was not.\n \n The thing on Mars first was photographed in 1976. It is a huge rock formation that resembles a human face. There are shadows that give it the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Some believe that it is real evidence that there is life on Mars, well it is not. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the \"Face.\" The new cameras snapped a photograph that was ten times sharper than the original one. The new image revealed that it was a natural landform. Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the clouds, but in 2001 a newer image was taken. This image was captured on a cloudless day, so there was nothing obstructing the view. This image also shows that the presumed face was a landform, and not the ancient work of aliens.\n \n So, in conclusion, the famous face on Mars was a natural landform. This is supported by the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001. The image captured in 2001 could also possibly see other objects if there were any. So, the face not a sign of life on Mars.",

A few days later NASA unveiled images for everyone to see while captioning it \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" The landform was just formed by shadow, which means this just gives others the illusion that it's a face, but it is just a natural landform. There were no alien to create this and it is only made naturally. Many out there have created movies, books and magazine article on the Face but this is all just bandwagon, trying to just sell their products and make money out of false theories. Later on, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew to Mars to take more photgraphs of the Face, when thousands of people were waiting for the end result to confirm that the Face was just a natural landorm.

People on earth see natural landforms that look like certian things all the time. Not to mention it looked like such a face because the shadows that it casted made it more detailed.\n \n If it was aliens it would benefit us. Like the text states, \"Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars.\" But its not. The text comes back afeterwards and says \"Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars.\" If it was an ancient alien statue we would say it and back it up, because it would have a highly strong benefit towards NASA because we could get donations for it.

The text tells us, \"Shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" The text also tells us, \"Because of its face like structure it become a great attraction.

There are many pictures of Mars and nothing else showed that there could be life. There are many reasons why this is not a factor that shows that there is life on Mars. There is not enough resources, it was shown to be a natural landform after better technology was used, and it is similar to the Middle Butte in Idaho as mentioned in the article.\n \n My first reason, is that there is not enough resources to be able to have life on Mars. There is barely any water except for ice on Mars. There are no plants to create oxygen. There have been no signs of any thing to provide life other than the frozen water as previously mentioned. Most of all Mars is too cold to be able to have life on it. The only way for something to live on Mars is if something somehow adapted to that type of enviroment.\n \n Another reason, is that it was shown to be a mesa type lanform. The first picture was similar to a face because technology was not advanced enough to take a clearer picture. After we made better technology we were able to get a better and clearer picture that shows it was just a landform.\n \n My third and final reason, is that it is very similar to landforms on our planet. We have mesas amd buttes all over our planet. The one that is most similar is in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

    Essay: "Ever since humans have discovered space and the existence of other planets, the belief that we are not alone in the universe has been a back-and-forth question over the years. It has inspired many works and become a huge part of pop culture. While this can be fun to think about, sometimes people who can't accept the truth take it too far. The Face on Mars is just a natural landfrom because technology wasn't that good in 1976, people (especially conspiracy theorists) take can take things like this too far, and the formation is just like others on Mars and even on Earth.\n \n The original photo of the Face on Mars was taken way back in 1976 by NASA's Viking 1. The spacecraft was only trying to find landing spots for another NASA ship, Viking 2, when the picture was snapped. Technology has evolved vastly over the past few decades, but 1976 was right at the start of this kind of space exploration technology, with the moon landing only happening 7 years prior to this event. When the latest photo of the face was snapped in 2001, its resolution was 10 times sharper than the Viking 1's photo. It showed every crack and bump on the surface of the \"face\", while the Viking's only showed patches of white while most of it was covered in shadow. Even a Mars Global surveyor photo from 1998 (which was taken with better technology than the Viking 1's) revealed a mesa formation. The photos taken after the original in 1976 definitely show anything but a face, which shows that the Face on Mars was only seen because of developing technology at the time.\n \n Everytime there is a statement made by an organized group like NASA, or a government of any kind, people like to try to disprove these statements and say that they are fake. These people are called conspiracy theorists. They usually jump to conclusions on statements like this all the time with little or no evdidence. Back in the 1960s and '70s, the space race had started, causing many people to believe that we are not alone in this universe of ours. Anytime there was a trace of alien life out there, radios would broadcast about it, new channels would cover it, and sometimes even movies were made about these, just like in the case of the Face on Mars. Since these are people's main sources for news, they believed the claims instantly. When NASA revealed a picture of a supposed 'face on mars', the population went crazy. This was solid proof of ancient alien life on another planet, the conspiratists believed, but alas, the only reason this face appeared was due to technology with not enough resolution to snap a high quality picture of the formation. Conspiratists claimed that alien life on Mars would be something that NASA would \"want to hide\", but in response to this, defenders of the NASA budget said that \"they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars\". If the face was actually alien, NASA never would have come out and told the public of its existence, or at least would've said that it was alien in its reveal. Instead that caption read; \"A huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head...\" This shows that NASA directly knew that the formation was natural and most definitely not alien.\n \n The Face on Mars was quite the phenomenon, which started out the belief that there was alien life out in space and also on the planets near to Earth. When scientists first saw the formation from the Viking 1, they were suprised to see a face on the screen, but that was only at first. Scientists quickly realized that the face was nothing more than a Martian Mesa. These mesas are very common around Cydonia (the region of Mars in which the photo was taken). These formations are also on other parts of Mars and even here on Earth. Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated, \"It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River of Idaho.\" This shows that a formation like a mesa is super easy to indentify, and one on Mars could just as easily be identified with good enough technology, as proven by the Mars Global Survey spacecraft and the Mars global surveyor from 1998, which was even taken through clouds on the red planet. It makes sense for the formation to be a mesa, especially since the fact that there were no other facelike structures like this found on Mars since.\n \n The Face on Mars is a natural landform because the technolgy that took the photo wasn't that great compared to years after, conspiracy theorists can really blow things like this in the worng direction, and the formation of the face resembles structures like that on Mars and Earth. With our knowledge and exploration of space growing every day, it is just a matter of time until we discover alien life somewhere. The problem is, people can get so caught up in these kind of things and overexagerate them to beyond reasoning. Technology has advanced so much in the past few years, so much that we can see every crack and divit on the surface of a planet, so the question is, when will we actually discover a real \"Face on Mars\"?",

People who believe it is created by aliens suely hasn't seen all the evidence behind \"The Face.\"\n \n First of all, when people saw the face in 1976 they couldnt have had o believe an aliens as making it. How could have there have been a person on Cydonia or an alien. That is why they went back to Mars to prove some scientists' theories wrong. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor had flew over Cydonia for the first time. The surveyor had a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Some people were not satisfied because it was cloudy on the Red Planet. They said that the alien marking were hidden by blaze. Compaing the picture of 1998, it certailey looks more like a regular rock on a surface. They went back four years later on a less cloudy day to still prove the believers wrong.\n \n On a cloudless day the Mars Global Surveyor took away a piece of evidence of aliens in space. On April 8, 2001, four years later than the last visit to Cydonia, the surveyor captured the photo much better than all pictures and proved tha the face was a natural platform. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in he best 1976 Viking photo.

    Essay: "Scientists have been trying to figure out what the face is on Mars. It turns out that the face, is not really a face. Scientists discovered that the formation that everyone is seeing in the photograph is actually a landform called a Butte, they are most likely found in the American west.\n \n This formation was so astonishing that it was featured in a Hollywood film, Magazines, Books, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. People thought that this kind of evidence should be hidden. A few scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact, but phototgraphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. MGS is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine. Eighteen years later they decided to end the mission, they felt that it was important to taxpayers.\n \n On April 5, 1998, MGS flew across Cydonia for the first time. A team of Mars Orbiters took a picture ten time sharper than the original photo. An enormouse amount of web surfers waited for the pricture, but when it posted they weren't so satisfied. There wasn't and alien monument after all. NASA just does not pass over the face very often.\n \n On April 8, 2001, MGS drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in field of view. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa, which again are landforms common around the american West. It reminds people of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\n \n Each of the pictures pixles in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters compareed to 43 meters per pixle in the best 1972 image. If there were to be objects in the pictuer such as a plain on the ground or Eqyptian style Pyramids you would see them. So after all there is no face on the panet, it is just a landform called a butte.",

Twenty five yaers ago somthing funny happened around mars NASAs spacecraft was circling around planet. A few days later,NASA unveiledthe imaage for all to see. Although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars global surveyor [MGS] arrived at the red planet in sSeptember 1997 eighteen long years after the viking missions ended. So it was true that aliens did not do that to mars because aliens are not real and also NASA even said that they did it on mars they said it was an accident that happened in September 1997. Also in April 5,1998 ,when Mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time,Micheal malin and his mars obiter camera [MOC] team snapped the picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos.",

    Essay: "Many people think that the \"Face\" is actually the work of an ancient civilization that used to, or still might, live on Mars. Those people are proven wrong in many ways. I believe that the Face is not a Martian creation because if NASA knew about it, they would tell people so that they would get more publicity and make more money.\n \n Also, after a higher resolution picture was taken of the face, it was clear that there was no sign of equipment near the face to build it. Lastly, Jim Garvin, who is a Mars expert, said, after long research, that the Face is just a landform.\n \n The first reason people should be able to tell that the Face is not a Martian creation is that NASA would tell people about the chance of Alien life on Mars. That fantasy has been around for hundreds of years! Books and movies have stories of Aliens from Mars. There would be many more sales for NASA. Therefore, it is obvious that NASA would tell the public if there really was a chance of Martian excistence.\n \n On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a photograph of the Head that was tens times sharperthan the first picture taken by the Viking. Many anxious web surfers where waiting for the image to appear on the JPL web site. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no sign of aliens at all. Concluding the reason as to why the Face is just a coax.\n \n The third and final reason as to why the Face is fraud is that scientist Jim Garvin said that the Face is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which means landforms common around the American West. He said, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face which appears on The Red Planet.\n \n Now many people may argue that the picture was taken when it a cloudy time of the year in Mars - the picture may not have been able to see everything around the face. But, according to Garvin, you can discern things in a digital picture three times bigger than the pixel size so if there even were objets in the picture that showed any sign of excistence, you would be able to see them. Therefore there is no possoble way of a human or Martian building the Face.\n \n So, the many people in the world that believe that the Face on Mars is actually a creation of living beings, they are proven wrong. Multiple reasons point to the Face just being a landform that just so happens to be in the shape of a face. Not only would it take forever to make a face that is two miles long, it would also take supplies - which were not found. Furthermore, the Face on Mars is not a Martian creation.",

    Essay: "Some people believe in the supernatural and in the paranormal. Others on the otherhand dont. Then there are people that believe in aliens and in various life forms on diffrent planets. If we ask the question \"Is there such thing as aliens and if so how do we know?\" In hollywood there has been many movies made about aleins and about other life forms in the galaxy (ET, the Men In Black series, and Indipendence Day). The reality is that we don't know if there are really aleins, we just have faith in the unknown.\n \n The people that believe aliens exist had a feild day over the recent discovery by NASA in 1976-2001 by the Viking 1. The viking 1 found an astonishing rock form that took the shape of a humans face. the first thing most people said was, \"There is alein life on mars!\" These people could be right, we have been serching for dozens of years for other life foarms, and its the perfect time to find a breakthrough in science and in astronomy.\n \n To others the belief of the face, found on mars, made by an alein is a hoax. It is just a story for the public to stay entertained. The face on the surface of mars is just a rock and it is made by natural movement under and on the surface of mars and not by a life form such as an alien. In the article\" Unmasking the Face on Mars\" the author says, \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" The face in mars brings apn no new information to astronomy because there has not yet been any proof of any life on mars.\n \n The faith we have in this \"mission\" is more faith than we have had regarding new creatures in the deapths of the sea. When we think of ailens we see big eyed weird headed creatures, but how do we know? The answer is that we dont. We have no assurence that there are aleins and they look and talk how we believe they do. There are manyh possibilitys on how landforms made the face such as the hardening of lava, tectonic plates, astroids or other rocks that entered Marses atmosphere,or it could have been made by the rotaion of mars .\n \n Over all the idea of aleins makes a good hollywood movie, but it doesn't make a good reality. As Mr. Garvin says, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars.\" Until the day we physicaly see another life form, we won't have any further helpful scientific discovery regarding aleins.",

At that time, they didn't' really what know what it was exactly. I am here to prove you that the Face is just a natural landform.\n \n If the Face is an alien monument, there could have been mysterious looking structures on the monument. The Face is just a butte or a mesa as it was said by scientist Garvin that it reminded him of a butte in Idaho. The 2001 image of the Face doesn't show anything phenomonal, it is just a simple landform. According to NASA, the shadows just give the landform a face. As for my last evidence, Michael Malin and his team took a sharp photo of the Face explicitly revealing that it is just a landform.\n \n As the old photographs suggests that it is something made by the aliens, it is not. It is just a landform based on the newer photograph. A scientist claimed that the Face is either a mesa or a butte which reminded him of a butte he saw before.

Scientists have done multiple studies to conclude that it is a natural landformation.\n \n First of all, the formation is known as a mesa. There are shadows from the formation that give the illusion of eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Also in the picture from 2001 each pixel in the photo graph is 1.56 meters on the planet so you would be able to see any artifacts or structures if there were any.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not an alien formation.

    Essay: "The \"Face On Mars\" is getting talked about a lot lately. Many people have different opinions about the face. If you aren't familiar with the \"face on mars\" then you're probably wondering why there is an argument going around. You're probably wondering this exact question: \"Why is there a big argument about \"The Face On Mars?\" The folllowing details and information will be informing you exactly why scientists and theorists are having different opinions about the peculiar face.\n \n Some scientists are saying that the face up on the moon was not created by aliens because of all the research they have done with and about it. One example that tells you why it isnt an alien artifact is the shadows. The only way the messa (face on the moon) was able to have facial features was because of the shadows that was cascading down upon it. The shadows gave an illusion of eyes, a nose, and also a mouth.\n \n Another example, would be the pictures that the scientists have taken. The first picture that was taken was taken on a cloudy day. The picture was to blurry to be able to make out any details. In 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took another picture that was ten times sharper than the first. One of the cameras they had contributed greatly to the search, since that camera was so sharp they would have easily been able to find any markings from extraterrestrial beings.\n \n Also another detail helping the scientists was the weather. The weather took a massive part in this study. Since it wasn't a clear day at all and there were \"wispy clouds\", like in paragragh eight, the MOC team could not get a clear picture. When the team comes back to take yet another picture it is a clear day and with that clear day they are able to pick out any details from the \"artifact\" if there are any to pick out.\n \n A final example, is how they compared the face to a formation on Earth. The scientists compared the face to the Snake River Plain of Idaho because of how similar they are. They are similar in a way because of the isolated messa, height, and landforms.\n \n Theorists are saying the exact oppsoite from the researchers. Here is an example fo why they thought it was a true artifact. A few scientists themselves thought that is wasn't just a landform but something more. Since the scientists believed many people instantly believed too. They didn't think about the research that was done, but they chose to believe the few scientists.\n \n An example that would support the idea of them believing, is that there were many movies made about the face. Many people believe everything they hear and what they see on T.V.\n \n A final example is, how the skeptics thought it was created. \"If the aliens didn't create it then how did it form?\" That question was most likely going through their mind, trying to figure out if they should believe science and research or they should believe movies and others.\n \n Yes, i understand how skeptics actually believe that the face was made by aliens because they dont know how it was created. They don't know who created it either. Scientists are proving that it was weather that created the formation and maybe even astroides. Theorists may also thinking that the haze prevented the scientists from seeing the alien's markings. If weather and haze prevented that then why didn't the scienists see the markings on the next photo that they took. That photo was even ten times shaprer.\n \n The examples I have lsited help inform you why there is an argument going on about the face. Science clears and explains a lot more phenonmon than opinions and belifes do.",

    Essay: "It was actually quite simple to see that it was not created by aliens. If you look at the pictures, it acts as if it was like any other landform on earth. As humans, our mind is very good at creating a false idea because we want it to be it is that way. However, it is clearly shown that the faces were not created by aliens.\n \n In the pictures shown in the article, the face changes as any fossil or landmark would on Earth. The jump from 1976 to 2001 is a big chance of what it would look like if it were on Earth. As said in the article, the JPL web site says it was a natural landform, not an alien monument. The only reason that the rumors of alien monuments still exsisted is because there were people who were still not satisfied.\n \n Another reason that the alien monument rumors were false is because even with a cloudless day in Cydonia, it still appeared as a natural landform. Granted, the rumors of clouds blocking the actual image of the face was a logical argument. However, they even took pictures on a cloudless day, and it still appeard as a natural landform.\n \n The theory that this was an alien civilization is totally inacurate. The pictures clearly show the actions of the face. Just because our imagination can create false ideas of life on another plannet, the evidence shows that acts and looks as a natural landform.",

The face was located in Cydonia it is two miles long from end to end. It looked like a face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. It is actually a mesa. Then,in 1998 the MOC wanted to take another picture because many people were saying that it was created by aliens. This picture would be in movies,books,magazines,radio talk shows and even in grocery stores for twenty five years.\n \n When NASA let the public see this picture they believed it was created by aliens. We went back in 1998 and took some more pictures and it had still looked like a face but it was not. My people said that we (NASA) would rather hide then say that there was life on Mars, many conspiracy theorists were saying. We wouldn't hide we would tell the public so that we could get more money to be able to go to Mars and see these aliens.\n \n What some people wanted was aliens and other people didn't. Mostly all the scientists at NASA including myself did not believe that the\"face\" was created by aliens. So in 2001 we went again to Mars to get a picture of the \"face\". It would be a clearer picture because the cameras were ten times better than the cameras in 1976 and in 1998. It was very hard to get to that exact spot on Mars. The face on Mars was 41 degrees north martian latitude. On April 8,2001 it was summer in Cydonia when we had taken the picture in 1998 it was winter and it was very cloudy. The camera was 1.56 meters per pixel in 1976 it was 43 meters per pixel.\n \n So if there was objects on Mars like a plane of a pyramid we would know because we would be able to see it. We said that it was either a butte or a mesa. They are commom in the American West. It's kinda like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.

Like in this situation, the \"Face on Mars\" that is said to be bona fide evidence of alien life, but it is proven to be just a natural landform.\n \n Forty years ago, when the \"face\" was first revealed, it seemed very likely that it was not made by nature. The search for alien life and all the money put into NASA's programs made people believe what they wanted to hear. As time went on, and new technology was put into effect, the images of the mesa became clearer. In the early 2000's, it was made clear that the mysterious \"face\" was just an illusion. One can tell from the images of the \"Face on Mars\" that the mesa can appear to look like a face when out of focus. Alien life on Mars has not been proven either, so without evidence of life, we can't assume that the \"face\" was not created by nature.\n \n It is possible that the mesa appeared as a face because of the dept perception and shadows. In reality, the landform barely looks like a face at all. In the most recent photo, the small details on the mesa almost look like the rivers we have here on Earth. The mesa is even compared to landforms that are found on Earth, as stated in the article. Since there is no proof of the \"face\" being alien-made, the only conclusion left is that it is a natural landform.",

    Essay: "Do you think it is a natural landform or a face? It is obvisouly a natural lanform! Mars has a lot going on, people wondering if there can be life on Mars or not, and now this.\n \n First, how could there ever be life on another planet? Mars does not even have enough water for human life. In the passege \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", it states, \"The caption noted a \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth\" The reson why the rock formation looks like a face could be from rocks being inside the sand to formate the face and the rocks could have shrunken or have gone away.\n \n Now, this face is a land form, it just looks like a face. This can happen anywhere in the world, not just on Mars. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars it says, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural land form. There was no alien monument after all.\" This proves that the picture that was taken may looked like a face but was in fact, a landform, and thd cause of this face can be from anything out in the environment.\n \n In conculsion, the \"Face of Mars\" is not a face, its alnd form, no faces can still be dented in a land form for that long. The cause of making this face can be from rocks, or any other thing on Mars.",

    Essay: "All scientists at NASA know that the \"The Face\" is a natural landform known as a mesa. But some people think that Nasa is lying to the public about it being a natural landform. I'm here today to argue that Nasa is indeed not lying.\n \n My first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying is that a drone was up in space taking pictures of it close enough to show the world tha it was just a natural landform. Viking 1 is the name of the spacecraft that took this photo and some mission controllers were suprised to see a face popu up on their screen. The chief scientist for NASA'S Mars exploration program said \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it .\"\n \n They also got more icture to deduce that it was actually instead of a face it was a natural landform. Thats my first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying.\n \n My second reason for knowing NASA is not lying is because the landform is called a mesa. Mesa's are more commonly found in the American West. So by thinking hardly about this it comes to mind could people that dont believe, could possibly being saying that this mesa isnt a mesa but something NASA is trying to cover up? But then the question comes to be WHY would Nasa be trying to hide some of this information from the public? Well it comes down to the simple fact they arent trying to hide anything from the public about the face they are giving us the true information and some people just dont thig thats the real actual truth.\n \n My thrid reason for knowing that Nasa is not lying they made the pictures into digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so if anything was on the surface such as a shack you could tell what it was. They do that so if they see anything that is a undertiminable object you can clerly tell what it is. The pixels arent as good as they could be today but they had a pretty lea view of what it is. they have the best cutting edge technology and are way more advanced than the open world is today so its highly unlikely that their system wasnt processing right. thats the end of my thrid reason.\n \n So some people believe that the face is actually just a natural landform but some people such as conspiracy theorists dont. I say that the conspiracy theorists have a point on why Nasa could be lying to the public. They probably think this because of the goverment owning and controls Nasa that Nasa is lying to us like the goverment could be because of their secret projects. The reason the goverment doesnt tell s about some of their plans is because its to keep the United States of America safe from the har of foreign countries. Those were the reasons conspiracy theorists think like they do.\n \n All that information can signify that Nasa is not lying to us. Though some people may think they are because they are apart of the goverment .But i think that Nasa is doing a great job and woudnt lie to the press. If they lied to the press they would be utting the U.S goverment a bad public view.",

    Essay: "First off , In my opinion I think that there is no face on the moon. Some of NASA believe that some aliens made the face on the moon years ago. I believe that there is no face and that is beacuse there are no aliens. If there is a face on the moon it was probably made by an astroid or a meteorid that crashed there a few years ago and it was just now starting to form more into a face. If it were aliens who created the face on the moon, why didn't they come back time after time so the humans could see them. Honestly, who is there to blame for this mysterious face on the moon? Many people may ask, what should we do to figure out if there is a face or not. Well in my opinion, I think we should have NASA send someone or some people to the moon and see whats really going on. NASA also doesn't have evidence that there are aliens that did it. They just assume that there are aliens basically. Maybe there is really no face on the moon. I really think that maybe NASA should either just let this go or they should just send someone to space to chck it out. I just don't like how NASA has no evidence that there are asliens who made the face. I think maybe NASA should just go check it out for themselves.\n \n Second, 25 years ago when Viking 1 snapped a photo of the face on the moon, it didn't really look all that good. Even when they took the photo from 1998 and 2001 the pictures still didn't look as nice as they should. People could always just snap a picture and rearrange things in the photo and then make it seem like there is an object there when there really isn't anything there. In the paragraph it even say's \"new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NAA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" That could possibly mean that when they were looking at photos they could have saw something else but rearranged the photo to see another thing that they didn't see but they wanted the world to belive them that a face wa on the moon. That is my opinion on if there is a face on the moon.",

    Essay: "The discovery of the Face on the surface of Mars was thrilling for the public. As a scientest working for NASA, I am constantly debating with others whether or not the Martian mesa commonly referred to as the Face was created by aliens. Many people think that it was created by aliens. However, I disagree with the fact that the Face might have been created by aliens. It is simply another Martian mesa located in the region known as Cydonia.\n \n One of the main reasons the Face was not created by aliens is because there are multiple Martian mesas throughout Cydonia. Martian mesas are commonly found throughout Cydonia, and it would be logical to think that the Face is just another Martian mesa. The only difference between the Face and other Martian mesas is that the Face contains unusual shadows making it look like an actual human face.\n \n Not only are Martian mesas commonly found in Cydonia, pictures taken by spacecrafts have proven that the Martian mesa does not look like a face. Although many people have said that the photo taken by the Viking 1 in 1976 resembles a face, unusual shadows made the Martian mesa take the appearance of a human face. Also, the photo taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 does not have very good resolution. In order to see the Face, the photo taken in 1998 by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had to be taken through wispy clouds which has led some skeptics to believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. However, the photos taken in 2001 by the Mars Global Surveyor are much clearer and have much better resolution. These photos reveal the truth about the Face; it is just another Martian Mesa.\n \n In addition to the fact that the photos reveal the truth, it would be illogical for NASA to keep life on Mars a secret. If NASA was to announce to the public that life on Mars has been found, it would significantly help NASA. More people would support NASA and hope more would be discovered about the life found on Mars and would encourage the government to provide NASA with large amounts of money to learn even more about life on Mars.\n \n Although it would have been cool to know that the Face was created by aliens, there is too much proof to support the fact that it is just another Martian mesa. With such advanced technology in use today, NASA will hopefully make huge discoveries in the near future.",

They plastered it all over the US not knowing if the \"Face\" was really evidence of alien life on planets; excluding Earth.\n \n Garvin recognized the landform.

Garvin said, and I quote, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n Scienctists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. There have been \"buttes\" or \"mesas\" in the region of Cydonia before. I do not understand why this \"Face on Mars\" is any different if it was common in the region where it was found. The formation looked like a face. Okay well, sometimes you see random formations on the street with trash. You wouldn't give it a second glance. So, I don't know why this formation on Mars would be any different.\n \n I believe that the formation is just different shadows coming together to make one big shadow.

    Essay: "Have you ever wondered about the Face? The one so talked about, movies and books were made about it? In the late 90's, there was a picture taken of a rather human like landform. But get this\n \n -\n \n it wasn't on Earth! The discussion of whether the landform was alien made or a common Cydonia Martian mesa was huge, and is still fret over today. But lets get real, the possibility of the landform being alien made is surreal - with our advanced technology today, we would know!\n \n About twenty-five years ago, an interesting picture was found with one of NASA's spacecrafts, Viking 1. From the region Cydonia of the 'Red Planet', Viking 1 had taken a picture of a large face that stretched almost two miles wide. The landform became better known as the Face. When the picture was released to public, it was a big deal. Scientists had begun to figure it was just another Martian mesa that just happened to have unusual shadows. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", paragraph two even states this. These shadows caused many people to assume it looked similiar to some kind of Egyptian Pharaoh. The general public, although amazed by the coincedence it had been, couldn't have ignored the sayings of a scientist, especially when all the facts come into play with the logical explanation - not aliens!\n \n Even with the scienctists saying what was undeniably the truth, people demanded proof. Few scientists believed the chance of the Face being put there by exterestrial beings, but getting images became one of NASA's priorities. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take ten times sharper images of the Face. In the paragraph seven, you could find that thousands of people were waiting, waiting for an image that may decide what exactly the Face had been. After the image had been taking, not everybody was happy. This resulted in many suggestions as to why there was no proof of aliens having made the Face. It was winter and hazy. Reading through paragraph eight of the article, you can also find many of the excuses used to try and find proof of aliens exsistence.\n \n With many complaints under their belts, Mars Global Surveyor went for another go. This time on a cloudless summer day. On Apri 8, 2001, they were sent in for another look at the Face. The images, taken again, did not show any proof of aliens. To many conspiracy lovers dismay, the images were rather like Earth Landforms. Instead of alien markings, they found that the Face is equivalent to butte or mesa. Even common to landforms in the American West. In paragraphs ten, eleven, and twelve, you can read through the precautions taken to find even clearer images of the Face, though nothing had changed. Without any other evidence to go off of, what could the theorists say?\n \n Others, such as conspiracy theorists, say that NASA has found evidence of the other life forms. They may be right, stating things such as this. But they also say that NASA is withholding this information. While that may be a good idea for other people, NASA's budget says otherwise. With the information of alien exsistence out, their funds could go up a rather lot. Would it be a good idea to hold this information to the public? Especially when it will not only be informing the people, but also helping NASA discover more about our universe.\n \n As stated the possibility of us not coming across alien lifeforms with todays technology is unlikely. With all the precautions they took to prove (or in this cause, disprove) alien exsistence, it is highly unprobable that we missed them. With the scientist, looking over the images twice, and then checking them, the answer is in lockdown. And even if we were, sharing the information is in almost everyone's best interest. If it had been aliens, we surely would have known, wouldn't we? Unless, of course, the aliens could were invisible. How about you tell THAT to the conspiracy theorist?",

The statement that the Face was created by aliens is nonsense. There are no facts to back the idea up. Aliens haven't even been proved to be real! People need to understand that the Face is just a mesa, a type of landform that be found on Earth aswell.\n \n If the aliens were real, don't you think something would have changed by now? There is absolutley no sign of any life near the mesa; not even on the planet. If the aliens did exist then we should have noticed some sign. The statement that the Face is only a landform is clearly correct, unlike the idea that creatures formed it into Mars.\n \n The statement that the Face is just a mesa has lots of proof to back it up. There are many sets of pictures, including the pictures from the original Viking itself. The Viking was the spaceship on Mars that helped capture the landform on camera. There are also pictures from recent explorations that further prove that the Face is just a landform.\n \n I think one of the reasons people like to dream up conspiracys is because of the other ideas spread by celebritys. People like talk show hosts spread there ideas for large groups of people to hear, causing people to further think on those ideas. Plus the movie that was made about the Face doesn't help by mixing the facts up. If I were to give you one piece of advice it would be to stick to the facts.

    Essay: "On May 24, 2001, Mars was the topic of conversation with those at NASA and other space stations who were included on the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission. On that day, the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. On the other hand, its sister ship, Viking 2, spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. According to Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, the face on Mars resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. But one argument leaves many citizens guessing: Is the face on Mars a true natural landform?\n \n Most at the NASA space station argue that the face is in fact a true natural landform. The face would be considered a natural landform because there isn't actual proof that aliens had created the landform. This statement meaning that there isn't, for example, video footage proof of the landform being created by aliens, which could have been something that could prove that the face is either natural or unnatural. Another reason why this face could be a natural landform is that no one has actually lived on Mars, so no one could stand up and say whether or not it's natural. For the face to be natural, Mars itself would've had to go through natural causes such as erosion or a quake for the face to be created.\n \n On the other hand, it's easy to see why people would think that the face was created by aliens. In the history of the world, many peculiar events have happened where nobody knew how they happened. For example, all over the Earth, there have been cases of weird patterns appearing in corn fields and mazes. People would say that the patterns were created by aliens, so many just say that weird occurences are due to weird, foreign beings: Aliens. Furthermore, another reason why people would think that the face was created by aliens that ties into the other side of the argument is that since no human being has lived on Mars, there is no factual evidence that states that the face was created by natural causes or by aliens; but since aliens live on Mars and other planets in space, people are forced to make the conclusion that aliens made them.\n \n In conclusion, some people don't even have an opinion and they just believe the scientific evidence over the belief that aliens had created them. People might believe this evidence because some people, in fact, don't even believe in aliens at all. But the face could very well be a natural landform due to natural causes such as erosion of the planet or quakes in Mars that formed the face. Or if there are aliens on Mars, the face-according to some people- could've also been created by aliens that lived on Mars. But according to the scientists and chiefs at NASA, the Mars Exploration Program, and other space stations involved in the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission, the face on Mars was only created by natural occurrences and they try to get people to believe it by plastering it all over Hollywood movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.",

Most importantly not letting people make a big deal out of this because they don't know what it could be yet .\n \n Sometime we can't say somethings at the most part , Because it's better not to let anyone know before people go crazy and go around asking a bunch of questions . The Face on Mars was discovered in 1976 , and by the time that has passed , it's easier to see how it actually looks . But of cource you can't just send someone out to space and actually see what's going on . It's not that easy to just do that . There could be some species that are out there somewhere and don't even know about it . A period of time we believed it might have been a alien artifact , but it doesn't look like an alien's face which is something we could be for sure about that . Seeing the picture that the ( MOC ) team revealing the photo of the face , people weren't so satisfied as they thought . The people must be thinking , \" There's something up in space , should we be clam or should it be best to be worried ? \" , that's what might have happens when people don't listen to what we say is best and do what they think is right .\n \n But at the end of all this story and \" Oh it''s this \" or \" No , wait it's actually that\n \n \" , it turns out that it is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or of the mesa . It's a common landforms around American West and it's the lava dome that formed an isolated mesa . Which is the same height as the \" Face on mars \" . Everything is perfectly fine , and everyone can be clam since we found out the actual and correct information and not just some random anwers that people were going around and saying about this .",

    Essay: "I don't think the \"Unmasking Face on Mars\" is true or really believable. Okay so maybe in 1976 you could sorta see a face but as the years go on, the face fades away, so how would there still be life on mars or anything on mars for that matter. For one why would you believe everything you saw on a movie, tv show, or in a magazine. People right fake stuff all the time to get more views or ratings. People crave things that aren't true.\n \n Nobody that is human has ever lived on mars or even walked on it.\n \n There is not any scientific proof that anything is out in outer space. If people want to believe that there is life on mars, then I guess they are just going to go into outerspace themselves and take pictures of whats really going on up there so the whole world knows. There has not been one person who has visited all the planets, so no one can really give \"facts\" or imformation about space. There is still a lot to discover and a lot more to find out. For all we know aliens could be real or unicorns.\n \n I think the ocean and outerspace have a lot in common because, they are like worlds of unknown living things. Hopefully one day someone will be able to explore all of outerspace and give us the real imformation and prove who is right and who is wrong. Just before you start giving out imformation to people make sure you know for a fact it's true. Also we all need to do a little research about everything. We barely know our left hand. So as I end this I would like to conclude that no one in the world really has the truth on whats really out there, we don't really know if there is life on mars or if it's just a bunch of crap people feed us to take our money.",

    Essay: "The \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landfrom. It was not created by aliens or other forms of life because there is no proof that it was but there is evidence that proves it is just a mesa or butte.\n \n In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling mars when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. It was about two miles from end to end. It seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on mars. But scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa. They were common in that area on mars, but it had an unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n A few days later NASA unreveiled the image for all to see. The headline said that it was a \"huge rock formaiton, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth\". The authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It did.\n \n After that the \"Face on Mars\" became a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. It even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.\n \n But some people think that NASA was hiding it as being bona fide evidence of life on Mars. But NASA defenders said \"they wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars\". Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Mars became a priority for NASA.\n \n So on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Mars for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. But not everyone was satisfied. The picture of the face was taken when it was a cloudy time of year on Mars, but some skeptics believed that the aliens were trying to hide the Face by using haze.\n \n After that in 2001 NASA took another picture of the face with 3 times the pixel size, so if there was anything the martians used to build it you could see it. What the picture actually shows was a Martian equivelant of a butte or mesa.",

    Essay: "Have you ever wondered about the Face on Mars? You probably told yourself it wasn't real, or you're one of those people who have done their research and love the idea of it being real. Well, I'm here today to tell you how it's not created by aliens. Aliens don't exist to our knowledge yet, so therefore we cannot assume that it was made by them.\n \n First, as we refer back to the 2001 picture, it looks cracked and it looks like it was covered. In the 1998 picture, it looked like it was somewhat burning. In the 1976 Viking 1 picture towards the middle of the article, it shows the shadows, making it look like a human face. The eye was caused because of a hole, so it was dark. The nose was caused by the shadow on the right half of the face.\n \n Then, NASA knew it was going to get popular very fast, and it did. It was a pop icon all over the world. For example, \"It had starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" (5). That goes to show NASA was in it for more fame, because who doesn't want to see a face on Mars?\n \n Finally, it's just a natural landform! As the article states, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image appeared first on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform\" (7). You shouldn't always believe what you hear. It wasn't (an) alien(s) who made it. It was a natural landform with a few shadows on it, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.\n \n The Face on Mars wasn't made by aliens. The pictures show it. NASA also just wanted to get popular off of it, because they know how us people are. We'd die to believe anything is true. It's also just a natural landform. Why would you believe what other people say?

    Essay: "Dear Reader,\n \n Good Afternoon, You may know me as Dr. Ema R. I'm Head Scientist down at NASA. So today I'm going to tell you about the 'Face on Mars' some people think its just a funky looking rock. Well my friends they are wrong. Now your going to move on to my studying and research I have done to find out what it is and I'm pretty sure I found the right answer.\n \n The 'Face on Mars' was found by us NASA, in 1976. It got very popular over the years then. By popular I mean appearing in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio, and even talk shows. Now, I know what your thinking. What was so popular about a landform on a planet other than ours? Well first, its not a landform, and second lets be completly honest here, if you were looking through a telescope and saw a face in the sky what would you do? You wouldn't shake it off and go to bed. At least I wouldn't, I would be showing it to everyone and try to turn it into NASA because you would be a hero for maybe finding life on another planet.\n \n What I think about this 'Face' is very important to the people that work with me in the lab. When they find something they bring it to me and see my opion so they can go look to see if I'm right, I mean I always am. Anyways, I would like to share with everyone here aboout my opionon on this, when the lab workers first came and told me about it I thought that they were nuts, like really a face in the sky guys? Until, one night I was working late in the lab trying to find out what this whole thing is about so I went out to the sky room to look through the telescope. I was zooming until I found Mars, I was searching through the planet and saw the 'Face' and it indeed looked like a face. I searched for more, then thats when I put my research to work.\n \n During that time of reasearch I found out a lot of things. In my lab I didn't do much work on Mars itself It was mainly, Saturn and Jupiter. The work I did on Mars made me think that we aren't the only planet with life. This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform. Thats when my research was finished and I talked to my boss about what I thought, he told me to anouce it to my lab crew and see what else we could find out. I made my lab crew stay after hours to see if we could possibly find more lifeforms. Let me tell you a few more things, the reason I thought it was a lifeform is thats what all the faces on Mars, if there is life, look like. When life on Mars dies they will bury them like we do.\n \n Also, the way this 'Face' appeared there when it was buried. It got buried there forever ago and now the skull is popping up. So now the Space crew turned the Mars rover into an investagator if thats what you want to call it. The leaders would put it into motion and try to find more life forms or signs of life. Maybe these forms there, don't need to live with water and oxygen like we do they may just have to live off of sunlight or dirt maybe something crazy like that. NASA will one day find more evidence of lights on other planets.\n \n I would like to thank you for reading my article, please if you think you have information about the 'Face' or other planets, contact us NASA on our website, www. NASA.com which also has an info hotline for you to learn more, and our Captains email. Thank You, once again.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Dr. Ema R.\n \n NASA (National American Space Association)",

The face on Mars isn't a creation made by the aliens. It isn't because why would the aliens want to create such a thing like that? On paragraph 8 in the passage it states \"The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter '98- a cloudy time of the Red Planet\" is what it says. If that was true, that it was a cloudy winter climate then the aliens wouldn't have enough time to be doing a creation like the face. The aliens would have no clue on how to do a face on Mars. The Face on Mars is just a natrual landform, nothing else. The aliens didn't do a face on Mars. To prove that, evidence from the passage says \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natrual landform.\" the web even says that it's just a landform. When the web surfers wanted information about it the web just said that it's a natrual landform. The whole Face on Mars is a landform that scientist found on Mars. The Face on Mars from 1976 till 2001 changed a lot. In 1976 they didn't have much technology to see the face clearly, so they thought it was a face of an alien because the picture was blurry and it looked from a blur that it was an aliens face. Until now in 2001 technology made it clear to see that it's just a landform that is cracked and looks from far away like a face of an alien. Evidence from the passage states that \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoluion.\" the team took a photo with an amazing camera to make it clear that it wasn't a face.

    Essay: "When it comes to alien life forms, people on Earth have found very few signs that they exisit. With the signs we have found, our technology now a days has proved the aritifacts to be just conspiracies. One of the great conspiracies of aliens started with a picture in 1976. The picture was from a part of Mars that wasn't explored very often. Since people have been curious about aliens for years, they blew the picture out of proportion which started a chain reaction of people thinking that aliens were among us.\n \n One of the many reason that prove this landform wasn't made by aliens is that the technology wasn't very advanced when the picture was first taken. This first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Viking 1 was taking pictures of Mars when the camera took a very hazy and blurred picture of a really big rock. Since the technology wasn't very advanced at the time, scientists couldn't see if the rock was shaped like a face or just shadows reflecting off of the rock to make it look like a face. No one was very certain what it was.\n \n Since no one knew exactly what the rock was, the public took the opportunity to make a really big deal about it. Back in the 70's and 80's aliens were a big deal. People wanted to believe that aliens were among us. Because the rock looked like a face, people wanted to know if the Face was made by aliens or if it was just another landform. To get the public stirring, there were movies, books, magazines, and radio talks shows about it to give consumers what they wanted, a real life alien colony.\n \n In 2001, NASA decided to get another picture of the Face. When the picture was sent out to the public, all of the rave about the Face was snuffed out because the picture looked exactly like a landform. Scientists then closed all exploration on the Face because the picture didn't look anything like a Face. It just looked like a plain, old, boring mesa. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Program even said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in Idaho. Since the picture was so exact, if there was any life in the picture, the scientists could've seen it in the picture.\n \n Aliens are still being researched today, but back in 1976, the rave of the Face created by aliens was all fake. Since the picture taken in 1976 in so blurry, we can't see exactly if it's a face or not. Then when the new picture was taken in 2001, we could easily see that the Face that was made by aliens was actually just a mesa or butte. All of the publicity that the Face got was just because at the time people wanted to know if there were actually aliens out there. The public have started some crazy conspiracies, but this one about the alien Face will always be remembered as one of the craziest conspiracies in space exploration history.",

The MGS flew over the face, Michael Malin and his Mars camera team took a picture that was 10 times sharper then the first photo. The photo revield thtthere was no alien monument at all it was a natural landform.\n \n On April 8,2001 the MGS got close enough to get a second, bettr picture. There were no objects in the face. If there was you would be able to see them,because each picture was 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters.\n \n So, the face is actually the Martian or a butte or mesa. Which are landforms common around American West. Therefore, the face was not created by aliens, and didnt have any object in it. Maybe you could do some more research about it .",

    Essay: "No way can that actually be made by aliens. The pictures don't lie, it is a natural mesa. We haven't even found life yet so how can we assume this is made by aliens.\n \n The face is really just an illusion. It is just a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that, ironically, make it look like a face. We only released it to the public to get an attraction to Mars. The program didn't mean for all these conspiracies. All we wanted was some publicity for mars.\n \n We even took another, better picture to prove it. I know not all people believe us that it isn't an alien monument. If you look at the picture though, it is clearly a natural landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the original. Still you doubt are findings about the landform.\n \n Again, I think whole-heartedly that it is natural. You can believe what you think it is. We don't even know of life on Mars, how can aliens make it if none are even there. You can be a fool and think that it is a alien monument, but the pictures show it. It is nothing but a perfectly natural monument on the possibly populated Mars.\n \n You may never believe me unless you go there and see it yourself. Personally it easily shows to be a natural landform. Many believe to this day that aliens made that structure and that it is impossible to have a natural sturctue of that likeness. Then again many more believe that it is perfectly natural and just an illusion.",

Not only this but the weather was not an ideal time for the image to be taken.\n \n When the image was taken it was at a certain time, year, and season. \" this on had unusual shadows...\" means that the sun was not hitting it deredctly to elliminate any shawdows that were there. \"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north...where it was winter in April'98-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Plant.\" This proves that the weather does have an effect on the image. Not only that but the image taken at this time was cloudy and reveladed a natural landform. The article goes on to say \"a cloudless summmer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...Malin's tean captured an extrodinary photo using the carmera's absolute maximum resoluiton.\" Meaning that the image was as clear as it could be and there were no clouds to make the image blurry. \"What the pictue actually shows is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" This proves that landforms like these were also seen on Earth and alien did not make it. Plus landforms like it had been seen on Earth\n \n Further more, this is not the first time a natural landform has been seen on Mars. In the passage it is stated \"Scienetist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one has unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This means that in the location where the Face was discovered landforms were common and nothing more than natural.\n \n An image of a face was photographed on Cydonia. NASA proved that the Face is only a natural landform on Mars and with enough eveidence to support it. The giant \"human\" face is just another natural landform and most definatly wasn't created by aliens on Mars.",

    essay: "The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.\n \n The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.\n \n Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.",

A Martian mesa is commen around the area of Cydonia. The mesa is only seen as a face because it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

It just simply can not.\n \n I belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times. There is basically no evidence that aliens have built this landface.\n \n Well If you still do not belive me and still think aliens have built this landface than I think you are insane because I gave you a bunch of reasons why there is no way and there is no evidence that aliens have built this landface. Everybody should be on my side and say mother nature has built this face, but untill there is prove aliens exist I don't think aliens should be in the topic about this.",

I know you are also thinking that this is crazy, because we all know aliens do not exist. There is no proof of aliens.\n \n It has to be a natural landform, because in the 12th paragraph Garvin said it reminded him of Most Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. Our universe can create anything, just because something look like it was made does not mean it is. There could of been rocks there, and the dust just blows around them. Making it look like it was made, by something or someone. The very most obvious thing is aliens do not exist, there has been no proof of alien. Even to this day in 2016 there is still no proof of aliens.\n \n In the 3rd paragraph NASA even mentioned it as a \"huge rock formation\" scientist are very smart if there was other such thing that made it, it would have already been discovered. Also the face on Mars was a good way to get attention, like paragraph number 5 said so. The face of Mars turned into a famous pop icon. It was on Hollywood films, all the way to Haunted grocery store check out lines. If people could get the public to think that it was aliens that made the face, it would have maybe become way more popular. Plus most people do not believe in such thing as aliens, if they do not have real proof.\n \n My very last example is , if NASA found out was aliens they would have already told the public. It would be huge for NASA to discover aleins. There is no way they would hide the proof that aliens are real. It would help their budget, if they did discover an ancient alien civilization on mars. As it says in paragraph 6 scientist started hunting for more information. It became a priority for them. All the pictures they took revealed it as a natural landformation as it says in paragraph 7.\n \n There is no way it is related to Aliens. So if someone says that NASA is just hiding it, it would be false. NASA would surely reveal that there is aliens on another planet. Just imagine how much attention they would get if they actually discovered it. They would probably be one of the richest people. It is positive that a face on mars, made by aliens is not real.

We dont have any evidence as to seeing or taking pictures of any aliens or UFO's. So why would aliens be on Mars?\n \n Due to the fact that researchers have identified that the \"Face\" is juast a mesa, I think is safe to say that there are no alien life forms on mars and there never was.\n \n Nasa has very good cameras that are way better than the ones in 1976. They can zoom in way more and take 3-D images as well. if there were aliens living on there you would be able to see UFO's and a whole lot of aliens on the planet. And if there were Egyptioan style pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see them to. The \"Face\" is a martian equivalent to a butte or mesa as scientifically proven by scientist.\n \n Another reason as to why the mesa on mars is a landform and not some alien made artifact is that in the article it said that there were shadowns giving off the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. \"Its a good way to enage the public and attract attention to mars\", as said in the story. Also making the Face a pop icon also would make more people think that there really is life on mars without any real evidence. The face appeared on movies and magazines, which made more and more people follow this trend of life on mars.\n \n The final reason as to why the object on mars is just a landform and not an alien made thing is that on a cloudy, wispy day, the photo was taken. Making it seem like the aliens did it on purpose. But, scientist took the photo again on a less cloudier day and found out that is was just a landfrom after all. when they shot it with their better camera, it showed that is was just made by mars just like earth makes its own lanforms sometimes. So it seems as though technology from back then just wasnt updated enough to get the job done.\n \n Ultimately, the reason that evryone thought that there were life on mars is because technology wasnt as evolutionized as it was in 2001 compared to 1976. With the technology today, we would be able to find out right away if there were actually life on mars. So in conclusion, there is not life on mars and there never was.",

In that photo it showed that there was a face on Mars. You might think that it was an alian or that their is life on Mars. The photo didn't showed so many details.

    essay: "In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as \"The Face on Mars.\" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.\n \n Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.\n \n On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.\n \n Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was. Now NASA had proved that this brilliant \"face\" was only a landform.\n \n NASA did endless amounts of research in hopes of finding evidence of martian life, so why would they hide something like that? Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform. The research NASA has put into may not have given them the results they wanted, but it may later benefit them in finding life on Mars.",

    essay: "As a scientist I had to discusss the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation of the face on Mars giving the mosts reasonable and lucid -something clearly shown- ideas. There is many reasons why this \"face\" was not made by aliens. As a scientist I had to explain some evidence that would show what this \"face\" is classified as. Also I had to show the main ideaology on these speculations or conspiracies that \"know\" what NASA is doing. My main job as scientist is to observe, study, and explain many mysteries but I had to use clearly expressed qualifications for the face to be created by aliens.\n \n For my first reasoning on this topic I had to discuss this person how this landform is classified as mesa or butte which occurs normally in many environments. Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, \"It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\" showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!\n \n After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.\n \n Another type of reasoning this \"face\" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this \"face\" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the \"face,\" shows that the \"face\" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a \"face\" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.\n \n Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.\n \n So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the \"face\" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the \"face\" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.",

    essay: "The \"face on mars\" is not a real face. The face is a mesa or butte that looks like the ones found in the American west. It looks like a face by the shadows that form on it. The camera that found the \"face on mars\" was old and later a new one took a picture that can clearly see the surface. The new camera cannot be argued with because it is the latest and clearest. Also why would NASA try to hide the fact that there was aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them alot.\n \n The mesa or butte on mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kindof sounds dumb. If you think about it in the way i do it would be lke an alien race looks down on our planet saw a mesa that looked like a face and thought we knew he was there and wanted look at him/her/it.\n \n Also dont you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the \"face\" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock.\n \n If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they was going to wait for a clear day too so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine,and the image is completely real too.\n \n If ther was really aliens on mars it would benefit them alot. Think about it why woul NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollors to study them. Also if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way,because what if they had technolligy we didn't wouldnt we already have it? If there were aliens wouldnt they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war.\n \n The \"face on mars\" is totally fake. Now that ive bestowed upon you my knowledge maybe you can pass it on to other conspiracy theorists. Then maybe the \"face on mars\" thing wil finally blow over. Next time something like this happens you can probably look into that further too. Also maybe just maybe conspiracy theorists might come to an end.",

They could've ruled us by now. The Face is a natural landform on Mars.\n \n To prove that this was not caused by aliens, NASA reported,\" Huge rock formation which resembles a human head that is formed by shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It is all just an illusion. We have seen some illusions in our past lives in space and maybe on Earth. You think that you see a human in the forest, and figured out that it was a tree.\n \n NASA has send an aircraft or a ship that was called Mars Global Surveyor. The camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing an natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all.\n \n So, if you think that is was the aliens, there's the proof. Aliens didn't create a face on Mars. It was just a landform that web surfers and/or NASA saw. Like I said, aliens should have taken over the galaxy. I guess not. I think they are so nice. You see aliens in youtube videos and movies.

I don't know anything about aliens of course.\n \n There it is, the face is a natural landform on Mars. I have proof that it was not a creation from the aliens.

    essay: "This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.\n \n The only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says \"Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all\". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?\n \n Scientists say that in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West\". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.\n \n But, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. \" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze\". So right now it shows that there could be a possibility that aliens could have made the Face. This one piece of evidence could be the evidence they are looking for.\n \n In conclusion, no one knows what made this interesting Face on Mars. But we do have a lot of information about what could have made it if it wasnt aliens. When we don't have a lot of information here, we can not really think what this Face was made by. All in all we think this Face was made by simple natural landform.",

Then we had noctice that in one of he pictures there was likeness of a human face. The head of the face was two miles from end to end. So we decide to send the picture back to NASA to see what they had to say about it. There replies where so shocking to us we could not belive it they that the face had been created by aliens.\n \n Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this.\n \n Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this. They would not be able to calculate the right measurments and angles also. Plus we dont think they would be able to survive on Mars because of the conditions that are there. These aliens would just have to be out right smart to do something like this. This is just one of those things that seem impossible for an alien to do.\n \n The third and final reason is the point we are trying to get across to you guys and that is that we think is just a natural land form that formed while the planet was being created. If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet.\n \n To wrap up everything about this mysterious face maybe it was created by aliens but we may never know because this face is on a planet where a human would not be able to live and survive to witness the aliens build it. The only people that might have got a chance to witness it is atrounauts that would have been up in space at the time.

Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. \"Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.\n \n To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. \"....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.\" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.\n \n In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",

    essay: "A Face was just found on Mars. Some believe that it was created by aliens. They don't have proof to show that it was created by aliens. Therefore, the Face is just a natural landform.\n \n There are a great deal of reasons to believe that the Face is just a natural landform. First, what evidence do the people that say it was created by aliens have. To make people believe that te Face was created by aliens, they have to have something to prove it. Then, there are comparisons to landforms on Earth that are very similar to the Face that was found on Mars. They also have no alien markings to prove that aliens made the landform.\n \n There are many reasons to support my claim. Some say that it was too cloudy to see any markings. But the \"Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" The spacecraft was rolled 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. The team had an \"extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Using a camera that good, people would be able to see anything resembling any alien markings.\n \n Using this evidence, peolple should believe that the Face is just a natural landform. The people who go against this have no proof of the landform being created by aliens. Go with the facts, not unproven theories.",

    essay: "Why do you believe the face was created by aliens? When looking at this image, you can think about that at first but if you believe it immediately, then there is something wrong about that. I will explain to you why the face was not created by aliens though i will also explain why someone may believe that.\n \n The face is an image we found in 2001 that was taken by our Viking 1 spacecraft that was circling the Mars. The face is an area of land on Mars that has the illusion of a face. The illusion of the face comes from the shadows making the land look like it has a nose, eyes, and a mouth that resembles a human face. It was a surprise for most people here at NASA but we didn't believe it was alien works immediately because we didn't have any real evidence of it. It just so happened to be a patch of land that looked like a face.\n \n We couldn't say it was made by aliens because we needed proof of that and we haven't studied Mars' enough to prove that aliens made the face. We know Mars is similar to Earth but it's still a different planet in our solar system. Although we hoped it might've been an alien civilization, we studied the face more and it was simply a landform similar to a mesa or butte of our world.\n \n Even though we know it was just a landform, there are reasons we could see people saying it might've been made by aliens. We know Mars is able to sustain life because of it's conditions and there has been few deposits of water found there, but we have never found an actual living species on the planet itself. We as humans still don't know if aliens live on Mars or if aliens from other worlds exist at all. Many people believe there are aliens from other planets and some don't really care about the subject at all but it is possible that there's life on other planets.\n \n Because we haven't figured out if Mars has life, people believe the strange and convinient findings on Mars (like the face) are works of alien beings. Although we have confirmed the face was not a work of aliens, we still don't know if aliens exist. We can conclude that the face is not the work of aliens but there just might be unearthly beings on our neighboring planet, Mars. Before we can confirm there are alien beings on Mars, we would need evidence to explain they do exist at all. But we can conclude, the face is not made by aliens.",

This face is actually just a common landform. Scientists have taken several pictures of the \"face\", and scientist would benefit from These are the reasons why I believe the Mars Face to be a simple landform.\n \n My first reason is the fact that there are similar landforms like it on Earth and Mars. Such as mesas in the American west. One specific mesa is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. There is also several other landforms like it on Mars. The passage states that \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"\n \n My second reason is that scientists have photographic evidence that it is nothing more than a mesa.

Another example from the text that makes me believe that it wasn't made by aliens is that, \"People think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars,\" I believe this supports the claim that there is no proof of aliens because if there was then NASA would have already put in the papers so that could get money to go and explore Mars but, since they haven't put out any information about Mars obviously they haven't found anything to prove that there is life on Mars.\n \n The second reason I believe that it was not aliens who made the face is because the astronauts might have just taken the photo when the shadows were in the right place. I believe this because the text states that, \"What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West,\" I believe this piece of evidence supports the claim because it proves that the shadows were only causing an illusion there was not eyes, or nose, or mouth they were only shadows that were in the right place.

    essay: "First of all, NASA only gets their information from research and cameras which they depend on to help them with their research too. According to the text it states,\"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible. To add to that it has been twenty five years since the discovery, and there is not a for sure explanation that is logical because some people think there is smething behind it.\n \n Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. According to the text it says,\"Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.\" Even scientists believed it too and NASA has logical thinkers in their coorporation too.\n \n Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,\"Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped.\n \n Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about. Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life?\n \n In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.",

    essay: "Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.\n \n First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people.\n \n Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.\n \n Of course, people still weren't satisfied.

But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory.\n \n In 1998 on April 5, for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia.

Scientist's said it was just a natural landform.\n \n For the second time, the scientist could yet again reach Cydonia once again to turn their conspiracy theory to fact. Others back on Earth said it was too windy and it made the clouds affect the picture. This time researchers used a maximum resolution camera to prove the theorists wrong. Yet again Garvin said, \" If there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were.\"\n \n Scientist said that the \"face\" was equivalent to a butte or mesa.

    essay: "So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.\n \n My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.\n \n My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?\n \n The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. \"It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Garvin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.\" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.\n \n My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?\n \n This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.",

    essay: "Hello I am a scientist at NASA disscusing the fase on Mars with you because you think it was created by aliens, but in the text it says \"There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at jet propulsion lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"\n \n There is no face on Mars it is just a bunch of rocks and shadows making the face. In fact it's just a mesa on mars with shadows common enough. It even said in the text \"Michal Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n All in all there is no alien life on mars and that the face was just a mesa. Michal Malin was the first to find that out and showed it to all the web surfers. I hope you found what you were looking for because there is no face or alien life forms on mars.",

    essay: "The Face is a natural landform,it is not something that was created by aliens. Aliens don't exsist so how could it have been from an alien. Mission controllers said that it is not easy to target Cydonia,it is hard work. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is landforms common around the American West. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because it is hard to find,it actually shows the Martin equivalent of a mesa,and aliens don't exsist.\n \n The Face is a natural landform. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,so if there were objects in the picture you could see what they were. Each pixel in the 2001 image spamsa 1.56meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. It also says in the passage that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some people believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. Thats when mission ccontrollers decided to look again, and thats when they said, \"Its not easy to target Cydonia, it is a lot of hard work\".\n \n With all this data that has been revealed people should think that its just a natural landform. If there was aliens that did this their markings would be other places besides just here. Even though some people aren't satisfied with this more things in the future can happen to make them believe this. Maybe if more pictures are taken then peoples thought of view with change. I believe that its a natural landform because its hard to find, it actually shows the Martin equivalent of a mesa,and aliens dont exsist.",

The text states \" It starred in a hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines, radio talk shows...\"\n \n This brings me to the conclusion that infact it is not real but was made real by televison and other things.

    essay: "Many people, including nasa, believe that \" the Face\" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.\n \n First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.\n \n Secondly, the only reason it \"has\" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.\n \n Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.\n \n Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.\n \n Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",

    essay: "Is There Really a Face on Mars???\n \n The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).\n \n When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.\n \n Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).\n \n Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.",

    essay: "Have you ever heard about the face on Mars? A lot of people have. NASA sent the Viking one up into space to try and capture pictures of mars. The Viking was taking pictures when it noticed a shadowy figure. Can you guess what that figure is? Conspiracy theorists have their own vision of what it was made by, but NASA's scientists had the facts about it!\n \n In paragraph two it says, \"The sensation of the face was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.\" The conspiracy theorists think otherwise. The conspiracy theorists think that the face was made by Aliens. They also think that the face was really think that it was made by Aliens, and that NASA knows it was, but they just do not want to reveal it. Conspiracy theorists think it's Bona Fide, and that it's evidence of life on Mars. This all shows that the conspiracy theorists have different points of view than the NASA scientists do.\n \n In paragraph seven it says, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting then the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" When scientists put the image out online not everyone was satisfied with what the scientists said. Conspiracy theorists still think that it was made by Aliens. This shows that the scientists at NASA have facts and that the conspiracy theorists have only a picture.\n \n In paragraph eleven Garvin says, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects in this picture like aiplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" In paragraph twelve it says, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" Garvin added, \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" This shows that NASA thinks that the face was just a natural landd form. Everyone else thinks that it was made by Aliens.\n \n In paragraph eight it says that the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Now everyone is saying, \"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" They all think now possibly they were made by Aliens. This shows that we may have made a serious mistake in how the face was made. The face could've been made by both natural forming or by aliens.\n \n In conclusion, the face could have been made by Aliens and we just do not know it. We could have been wrong for all we know! So we need to think to not doubt ourselves. We all need to think, was the face really made by aliens? It could've been! We need to learn to work together on our theories not against each other. Just think if NASA would've worked with the conspiracy theorists then we could've figured out what really made the face on Mars!",

    essay: "I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there. This is why I degree with whoever says that aliens formed the face on Mars.",

    essay: "The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.\n \n The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.\n \n Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.\n \n The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",

    essay: "The \"Face on Mars\" has since become a pop icon.\" NASA discovered the face, on Mars, when they took a picture of it in 1976. Some people believe that the face is real and some don't. Although, it might look real, it is just a messa. So far they only have older pictures of it, they also have confimed it a messa, which is common on Mars. A cheif scientist for NASA said it reminded him of Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho. Therefore, if the Face was real then why haven't we gotten more pictures of it.\n \n In contrast, they only have older pictures of it. Very few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian Messa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" However, people thought it was a real face. When the picture went online or on TV, people thought it was \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Even though some people are defenders of NASA, we still shouldn't give them money to see if there is an actual ancient civilization. If we do we could possibly be putting that money to waste. We should think about if the pictures are real or if they were photoshopped.\n \n However, NASA has confirmed it a messa. Which is a natural landform. Since it is windy or cloudy on Mars this messa could have been pushed around to make it look like a face. Even though we got pictures we would still be able to see things like airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks. We could have actually seen those on the ground. NASA dosen't even pass over the face that often. In contrast, we would not be able to get much information on it. So we should not even worry about how to figure out what it is.\n \n Therefore, when scientists Jim Garvin says it reminds him of \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" we should think about how is he right. When a scientists says something big and important we are listening and comparing something on Earth to Mars means that it could have been caused by erosion. Even though we are just getting pictures of it isn't enough. We could have better pictures now then they did back then. In conclusion, erosion and plains on earth come naturally. We have no idea what that could be made of it could be made of, sand for all we now.\n \n Therefore, we may have confirmed pictures it is a face. But do we have pictures that it is not just darker sand. The face could be anything on Mars. Because their pictures confirmed it a messa, it is a natural landform. In contrast, it formed naturally. Just like how it looks like Middle Butte in Idaho. Which was formed naturally. If this gets people saying that their could be life on Mars we probably would have found it by now.\n \n All in all, if the face was real then why don't we have more advanced pictures of it. NASA only has older pictures of this so called \"Face\", it looks like a natural landform in Idaho. So next time NASA gets people crazy about another ancient alien civilzation, think about how they need to prove it.",

    essay: "Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.\n \n First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?\n \n NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.\n \n If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.\n \n Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",

If it was created by aliens then NASA would benefit from discovering life on a different planet, so that shows that everyone in NASA is sad that we didn't find life. Landforms created from nature shouldn't be lied about just to get attention. That is why we don't tell other people a lie when it is just a landfrom like the Grand Canyon. Here are also reasons how I know it wasn't created by aliens.\n \n Some rock formations on Earth are created by wind chipping off peices until one day the rocks are completely gone. We didn't have any control of the winds that created the rock formations, so that shows that nothing living created it. Around the face is other landforms that were created the same way the Face was made. The Face is the only one that people pay attention to becuase it looks like a face, but if you look at the entire picture you can see that other landforms are there that might not look like a face, but they show that landforms are created naturally there.\n \n These examples show us that these landforms were not created by aliens, but by the weather that accurs there. That is why we shouldn't lie just to get attention and make everybody believe something that isn't real. This concludes that the Face was only created by weather like the landforms on Earth.",

The face was found in the region of the red planet called Cydonia. It is very hard for NASA to get the picture because they have to angle the satalite just right. I am not trying to be pestimistic but, NASA has seen landforms on Mars before and the article says,\"the mouth, nose, and eyes are allusions caused by shadows\". The facts just dose not add up to their being life on Mars.\n \n This face is just a landform. There are many ways this landform could have happend. For example, a duststorm, astroids crashing on the planet, or underground volcanos. These are all examples of how the face could have been created. The article says it was caused by butte or mesa. Time for everyone to come up with a new theory!\n \n This face was found in the area Cydonia. One day the aircraft Viking 1 was circaling the plant and found the face. Could you imagine the scientist face when the aircraft reported it back. A few days later they released it to the public. Lots of people were confinced that it was caused by some kind of lifeform, but really it was not.\n \n It was hard work for NASA to get the picture because they had to rotate the aircraft at 30 degrees. This was not easy because if they went to far Nasa would miss the face. If they did not go all the way around Nasa would still miss it . It had to be perfect. It could have been 29 degrees, one of, but it did not matter it would still miss it. It had to be perfect. NASA finnaly got the picture and proved that there was no lifeform.\n \n The nose, mouth, and eyes are caused by shadow illusions. They might have been formed by astroids crashing there, but are most likely shadow illusions. These illusions are caused when the Mars acsis are tillted a certain way and the sun hits it. This is most likly how the shadow allusion happened. This is what scientist says caused the illusion.\n \n In conclusion there were many ways for this landform to happen. Do not think this was caused by some kind of life form because there is not enough proff. There are many ways this could have been formed. For example. A dust storm, or underground volcano the list goes on. It may never be solved what caused it. Just face it it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.",

The cameras in 1976 were not very clear, as you see they have a 43 meter span per pixel, which makes the picture a whole lot more blurry. Even though it's been seen all over the world as an unknown landform or an alien artifact, the evidence has been seen through, and the face, is, well, not really a face at all.\n \n The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars. Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001. Yet the picture doesn't depict an Egyption face staring back at you, but a standard, normal, everyday, Mars mesa. The pictures of the face in 1998 showed clearly that the face wasn't quite a face, with a camera 10 times sharper than the original Viking camera, yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars. Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time. The cameras' span was 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the Viking's 46 meters per pixel, and the planet of Mars was as clear as the eye could see at that time, but there was no unnatural objects to be seen. Yes, it is hard to prove that the famous mesa isn't man-made, you would have to be on the planet to do that, yet the facts and research is all here and it's time to let go.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars has been very iconic on what it has done to the people, and the world as a whole. It's been analyzed and researched over, over, and over again. And it all comes down to the cold hard facts, which all points to the intriging rock of 1976 of being just a rock formation that was, well, lets just say, for now... misunderstood.",

The third paragraph says \" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. \" which is telling us that they want people to know more about Mars so we obvisouly wouldn't be showing the pictures if the aliens made it.\n \n Although there were few scientist that believed the Face was an alien artifact, in paragraph seven it says\n \n \" ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. \" , NASA scientist take their jobs very serious. People continued to say the Face markings were made from aliens but the NASA scientist said it was just a natural landform and some of the pictures were made from the shadows. On April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer in Cydonia, Malin's team got an \" extraordinary \" picture of the Face because many people such as the theorists said maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.\n \n In the second paragraph NASA was excited to see if the Face was something sensational and the article says \" Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. \" the only thing that made this one stand out was it has shadows that give it facial features such as a nose, eyes and a mouth. NASA soon showed the picture for all the people to see with a caption telling them what it was. NASA would not show the picture and make up something if the Face was really created by aliens.\n \n In the very last paragraph the article tells us what the picture actually shows from what the scientist at NASA have gathered. Paragraph twelve says \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. \". The scientist are telling us that the Face is just a landform, as a NASA scientist there is a lot of information about the Face and it was not made by aliens. NASA has got many photos of the Face and have also commented about what made it look like this.",

I believe that it is not alien made. I believe that the \"face\" is actually a natural landform.\n \n I believe that it is a natural landform because it is said that it looks like another landform on Earth.

There wasn't any proof of alien life on the face just theories made by consumers.\n \n People who believe it was made by aliens say that for many reason. The first reason is that hte first picture showed what look like a face staring back at you. Sencond reason is because they believe that we are trying to hide something from them. Also people want something to believe even if it doesn't have any realistic evidence. Last but not least the theory that aliens are out there has been around for ages so it wouldn't be wrong for them to believe that aliens did it.\n \n It may look that way in the past but only because the images we captured then were not as inhansed as the ones now.

    essay: "Many people believe that \" the Face\" on Mars is actually a alien of some sort or a human. I can truly convince you why it's not a alien, it's only a landform. I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.\n \n First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.\n \n Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts. Many would say that the aliens didn't want us to knw they exist but the article states it could have been a person going to Mars. Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.\n \n Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there. Some sort of creature may have made it and they would give us evidencce of life on Mars.\n \n You never really know if there may be some sort of living organim on Mars unless you study it closer. Either I may be correct and it just being a landscape made from a storm or I could be wrong and its a living organism. We will never know unless we do the research.",

    essay: "For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, \"aliens\" have done so.\n \n In 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.\n \n To conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform. But in reality, no one has the facts to prove that an alien life-form had created this landform. No one has the facts to prove there are alien civilizations on Mars. I only say this because there has not yet been facts, or any information involving alien-life forms or ancient civilizations on mars. Maybe in the future, there will be signs of some type of life-form on Mars, or very odd, peculiar objects that we may find somewhat weird, or, out of the ordinary. It is only, but a matter of time before NASA does find something very odd and out of the ordinary, on any planet, in our solar system.",

    essay: "I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the \"face\" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.\n \n The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.\n \n Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing. One scientist said that if there where buildings or aircraft on the surface that cameras would show if it was real or fake.",

    essay: "It is just a face. The Face on Mars is natural. This is evident because it is similar to the landforms here on Earth, and there is no sign of alien or human life.\n \n One may argue that it is possibly a sign of alien life on Mars. They might say that the fact that it does look like a face could mean it was aliens who made it. Maybe they'd argue, \"The timing wasn't right. You can't see all the details.\" At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural.\n \n This Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientists have even compared it to buttes and mesas here on Earth. An example of this comparison was by Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. He said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho stating, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\" Also, Mars is known for being a very dusty and rocky planet. It would be very easy for the formations of Mars to erode together and make such a landform as this.\n \n In addition to it just being a natural landform, there is absolutely no evidence of life near this area or anywhere else. This goes to show that it can't be man/ alien made. The NASA scientists, are using the highest quality cameras in technology today. They zoom in to 1.56 meters per pixel, allowing them to see every little detail. After doing this they found no shelter, no water, no life showing any forms of a civilization. There has never been any life, outside of maybe bacteria, found on Mars, and even if there was, NASA would quadruple their funds after that kind of discovery giving them no reason to hide it.\n \n The Face of Mars is simply a natural landform similar to a butte or mesa similar to those on Earth, with no alien interaction. There is no evidence to say otherwise, and a lot of evidence to back these statements.",

Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Â“MalinÂ’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameraÂ’s absolute maximum resolution.Â”\n \n That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.\n \n Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â”\n \n This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. Â“huge rock formation....\" It basically says that the rock is a formation \".......giving the illusion......\" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth.

Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...\"over time it transformed .....\" in the text... \"Huge rock FORMation.\" It is just a rock thats looks like a face, and just because it's on mars don't mean a thing.",

    essay: "Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a \"shadowy likeness of a human face\". Shadows on the object give \"the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.\n \n In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.\n \n The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.",

However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.\n \n This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures.

Land forms can be created at any given moment - but this certain one just seemd to catch someone's eyes.\n \n So on April 5, 1998 Michael and his Mars Orbiter camera took a shot of the \"face\" that made it look 10 times bigger than it was the viewers were shocked. Just as NASA revealed that it was only a natural land form. Some people weren't satisified just yet... they needed more information or did they want more to sound right?\n \n So for quite awhile the argrument grew bigger on the big question \" Did aliens really make this?\" No one wanted to believe NASA because, they thought they knew more stuff than they were telling people. Maybe they wanted it to be something bigger or something better.....",

    essay: "The Face is a natural landform and not an alien monument. On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia.\n \n Back at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figures it was just another Matian mesa, around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Also, NASA showed the image for all to see, and the caption noted a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The answer is yes the \"Face on Mars\" became a pop icon.\n \n But, few of us scientists believe the Face is an alien artifact. On April 5,1998, scientist, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the Face to prove there was no alien monument. When the Face image was finally posted, anxious web surfers saw that it was revealed as a natural landform and no alien monument at all. Everyone wasn't satisfied. Skeptics were saying that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n On April 8, 2001, we drew clse enough for a second look. One scientist said, \"If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.\" The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A scientist, Gavin, once said \" it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n The Face is just a natural lanform and not alien monumument at all. I think this because we all have taken pictures and used evidence as to why the Face isn't an alien monument. I hope everyone agrees with me and all the other scientists because the proof that we've given is reasonable.",

    essay: "Many have claimed that the human face found on Mars is an alien artifact, but how certain are they. According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.\n \n Some might believe that the so called \"alien artifact\" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth.\" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The passage also claims that the image reminds him of the \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" and that the Face on Mars is about he same height of an isolated mesa- which is a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude during the winter of April 1998. This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they \"photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it.\" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.\n \n As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the \"camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,\" and according to skeptics, \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that \" It's not easy to target Cydonia,\" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is \"bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.\n \n In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Others may disagree, but it is all about your interprutation on the topic, and hopefully the evidence used to support my claims did just that.",

    essay: "The face on Mars has been said to be created by many things. \"Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\"(paragraph 5) Other people believe that it is a natural landform. It could have been aliens, but we have yet to find life on Mars. The reason that makes the most sense as to why its there is that it is indeed a natural landform.\n \n Sure the land may look like a face but it is simply a natural landform. It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too. They are common around the American West. These are called buttes or mesas, and buttes are simply \"a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.\"(paragraph 12)\n \n This landform even reminds people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976. And lastly in 2001, it just looks like a simple mesa, no face, no alien markings.\n \n I do realize that it might make sense to you and other people that it could be made by aliens. But we have yet to find actual life on mars, let alone have it be made by non-existent creatures. This object object may seem extraordinary, but it is simply just a mesa on a planet we haven't even found running water on. I would love to say \"Yes, this was actually made by aliens!\" but sadly I cannot because it is simply just a landform.\n \n Therefore it could not have been created by aliens because these landforms appear on Earth. It looks similar to landforms on Earth. It also has been photographed many times over the years with better cameras each time. Scientist can gladly say \"This is only a landform, in fact these also appear on Earth as mesas or buttes.\" In conclusion, this is just a natural landform that was not created by other-worldly beings on Mars.",

Many things could be the cause of the face on Mars, but I'm sure it's not aliens. Scientist have not proven that aliens are even real yet. If aliens were real scientist would know about it, and they might try to capture one. The face would of been causes by wind, the spacecraft, or it could of been a natural landform.\n \n The face on Mars could have been caused by the wind. When planets rotate it could have cause some wind, and the wind could start to form piles of dirt. The dirt could have been moved into the shape of a face. The shadows give it an illusion of eye, nose, and mouth. The face didn't have any footprints around it so aliens couldn't done it. On Earth the wind blows, and pollen from one flower goes to another. Dirt on Mars could of blew to one area, and it could form a face.\n \n Spacecrafts flying around Mars could have cause the face to appear. The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big. When the scapecraft takes off it could form the face because when air is blown out it leaves a mark. A spacecraft couldn't have left a mark by the face. The fuel on the spacecraft could of left a mark after blasting off Mars.\n \n The face on Mars could be there naturally. It is the third planet from the sun. If there's any volcanoes; lava can explode out of it. Aliens wouldn't come out, and randomly make a face to scare people. The face on Mars must be natural because I don't believe that aliens are real. If aliens are real we probably would have seen one by now. Aliens can't be alive; if they were alive they would have to find food sometime.\n \n However, the face could be have been maded by aliens. I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before. aliens could be able to fly, and they don't have to touch the ground. The could pick up the dirt, and place it where ever they want to form the face. Inconclusion I still don't believe in aliens, but something had to happen to Mars. It could of been a natural landform or it could of been a spacecraft flying around Mars. They world may never know how the face was created, but I'm positive that aliens didn't create it.",

I've thought about it and I have read this story called \"Unmasking The Face on Mars\" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.\n \n When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption \"...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth.\" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This \"face\" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.\n \n Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage \"It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.\n \n Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that \"the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.\"(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.\n \n After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars\" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all.",

It also said that NASA said \"a huge rock formation which forms a head, eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" So everything is made out of bunch of rocks.

Also, in Earth, there are many landfroms that looks like things. Like Middle Butte in the Snake River. And it is almost the same size as the Face on Mars.\n \n Just because it's on Mars doesn't mean it made by aliens. It's made out of natural. Sometimes strange objects appear around the Earth.

    essay: "The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.\n \n The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of \"The Red Planet\" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.\n \n The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. \" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken.\" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.\n \n Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.\n \n Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity\n \n My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa. The mesa on the planet is only a natural landform that happens to look like a face. Nothing more and nothing less.",

We just assumed that \"this one had unusual shadows.\" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.\n \n Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.\n \n Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was \"winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.\n \n Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a \"cloudless summer day.\" \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,\" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution. As Garvin went on to add, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin stated. The Middle Butte is about the same height as Face on Mars. These things are so similar, it is almost impossible to think that the Face was created by aliens.",

    essay: "Are aliens real or just a myth? Aliens have supposedly done many things on the planets. The question is, did the aliens create The Face on Mars? Or is The Face just a natural landform on Mars? There are many theories on which one is true.\n \n The Face on Mars is just a natural landform on Mars. There is a theory that has been going around for centuries, that aliens created The Face. Many people will believe whatever they hear on T.V. or anything that draws the media attention. People forget that they need facts and or evidence proving something. Otherwise it will only ever be consindered a theory.\n \n Mars happens to be like Earth in many ways. There was once water on the red planet. That has facts to back it up. Mars is believed to have once held life, it may or may not be true. NASA is still working on whether or not Mars had life there once. Yet, since Mars is our sister planet, also may have common characteristics. As in there natural landmarks. But, if there is actual proof on aliens, maybe they did make The Face.",

    essay: "Yes, many people do think that the \"Face on Mars\" was a monument created by aliens, possibly creating a sign of some sort. However, this is not true. What you think is the \"face\" is actually a natural landform. This natural landform may appear to look like a face, but why?\n \n The landform looks like a face becuase of the shadows that hit the landform in certain areas. \"... this... had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (2).\" It makes it look somewhat like a face. \"...a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth (3).\" Another reason why the landform looks like a face is becuase our eyes, that play tricks on us, may make it seem real that it is a face. Such as illusion that make it appear that the landform looks like a face that is staring up at the camera on Mars. Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact.\n \n \"...Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origional... photos... when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no monument at all (7).\" \"What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West... That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12).\" So the landforms that you are seeing are actually common along the American West. They don't just pop up out of nowhere. They have been seen before. It's not like it is a first thing that scientists are just discovering.\n \n This evidence proves that there is no alien monument on Mars, it may appear to look like it. But scientists have proved that it is only a natural landform, created naturally, on Mars. Not an alien monument that was created as a sign by aliens on Mars.",

    essay: "Why does NASA consider the \"Face of Mars\" to be a natural landform? They claim that the \"face\" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.\n \n Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed \"haze\" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.\n \n In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called \"alien face.\" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the \"alien face\" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.\n \n On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure \"resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face of Mars\" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",

    essay: "The face of Mars is a landform that looks just like a face. Even though it looks like a face, it has been proven that it is just a landform and if you zoom in on it, you can tell that it isnt manmade. There are landforms on Earth that look just like the face too.\n \n Scientists have zoomed in on the picture and have proven that the face of Mars is just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Butte's, or mesa's, are landforms common around the American West and are also on Mars. The face of Mars is just a really odd shaped butte and people have mistaken it for alien structures. The face also kind of looks like a butte called Middle Butte in Idaho. People have also said that the face looks about the same height as the Middle Butte in Idaho.\n \n The people at NASA had the first pictures of the butte zoomed out enough that it looked like a face. The NASA camera that takes pictures of Mars is in a wierd position so it doesnt pass the face that much and when it does, its not very close so when they zoom in, the pixels are too big to see. When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.\n \n Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up. Landforms can have all kinds of shapes and the face of Mars just has a very unique shape. In conclusion, the face of Mars is just a odd shaped Butte.",

    essay: "Do aliens really exist and are they capable of doing something like this? I don't think they could but if they were capable of doing something like this. We will need some proof to stand with this. There is 3 reasons why this is just a natural landform. They can just be like any landform on earth, a face like this can happen anywhere else, and if you believe in aliens are they really capable of doing something like this?\n \n The first reason why this is just a natural landform is because it can also happen on earth. For example, this can happen upon natural sources. Such eratation and it can just be a mesa. Another example is, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough round Cydonia\"(2). If this is common than most likely it wouldn't be made by any alien. My last example for this is, most landforms have ways it can look. The landforms can happen anywhere and that wouldnt mean it was caused by an alien. If something like this happened on earth most people would think it was caused by natural thigs like the weather.\n \n My second reason is that things can happen anywhere. For example, another planet my have this but that doesnt mean an alien went and left it there so we could find it. If an alien did this we would be able to find something almost the same as this face. Another example is, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars\"(5). This can be true but if it was an alien wouldnt they do a face they new or reconized. Lastly, in the passage it states that \"There was no alien monument after all\". The picture clearly showed a landform not an alien made monument. In conclusion, things like this can happen in different forms but nobody has proven it was made by an alien.\n \n My last reason for why this is not an alien made monument is because there is no proof that aliens made it. For example, have aliens been proven to exist. No proof was every made that aliens exist in the planet mars. Secondly, how could they build such a thing. if aliens built it than there must be a great amount of them that we did not know about. Lastly, if aliens aready built a Face on Mars why can't they do the same thing on Earth. there is no explanation of they wouldn't be able to do this. In order for the aliens to make something like this that would mean they are capable of this and more but they still haven't been proven to exist.\n \n In conclusion, the face could have been made by something other than aliens. The three reasons explaining why it couldn't have been aliens is it could have been done by nature, it can happen somewhere else, and are aliens capable of this. This can prove that aliens didnt build it, that it could have been made by different things.",

    essay: "The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.\n \n There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.\n \n If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.\n \n They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.\n \n While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.",

    essay: "I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform. It may look like a face but it is really not. What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away. So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad. It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.",

Well as a scientist I'm here to tell you it was not created by aliens.\n \n This face on Mars was not created by aliens, but was created by nature itself. The Face on Mars is a natural landform. I know this because as a scientist of NASA we believe this face is just a huge rock formation. This rock resembles a human head.

It has played a role in movies, showed up in magazine articles, and has been a topic on radio talk shows. Many people have come to conclusion that NASA would rather hid information about this such thing.

NASA takes pictures of the Face on Mars but many aren't satisfied by the quality of the pictures. As a scientist at NASA it is very challenging to capture a good photo because this face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude.

The spacecraft had taken pictures of this landform and show the world a few days later in order to attract people to Mars. Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public, but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. Scientists and astronaunts have denied this by adding titles that suggest otherwise on there photos, showing the photo in the first place, and going back up to space to take more pictures.\n \n According to paragraphs 1 though 5, NASA had found a landforn that resembled a human face of an Egyptian Pharaoh located on a region called Cydonia. Mission control was surprised to see the face, but believed it was just another Martian mesa with unusual shadows, so they decided to reveal the pictures to the media, knowing there wasn't anything \"top secret\" or alien like about it. Then, according to paragraph 5, NASA had captioned the image, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,\" basically telling the public that it was just a quirky looking natural landform, not a big alien conspiracy theory. People defending the NASA budget even claimed they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, basically meaning there wasn't life that they knew of. Finally, in paragraph 7, another NASA spacecraft went over Cydonia on APril 5, 1998 and took better, sharper pictures, showing that it was just a natural landform that didn't have a civilization in it.\n \n In conlusion, NASA was not trying to hide a whole big alien civilization theory from the world. They had just saw a cool natural landform with weird shadows that made it look like a human face and decided to share it with the world. If there was a conspiracy, NASA wouldn't have showed the picture to the world, added a title stating that it was an artifact, or have willingly went back up to space to take another picture of the landform. Therefore, NASA is not hiding any ancient alien civilizations from the United States, or any other part of the world.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars is a natural landform and not something that was created by aliens. The Face is a natural landform because the sharper pictures that were taken after the Viking photos revealed that it was a natural landform. Secondly, the scientists had taken another photograph which helped confirm what exactly the Face was. Also, the text states that the Face is \"equivalent of a butte or mesa.\" Although some people think that the Face was created by aliens, there isn't enough information to support that claim.\n \n First of all, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia in 1998. According to the passage, they \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" This means that this camera probably caught eye of more objects and got a more detailed idea of what this formation looks like. The Viking photos weren't as detailed, so the people who saw those photos originally got the idea that aliens had created it. The picture that was captured had revealed that this was, in fact, a natural landform.\n \n Secondly, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to Cydonia on a cloudless day, since some people were second-guessing if the picture was accurate or not. According to the text, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,\" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.\n \n Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said \"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars, is it really what NASA says it is? The Face on Mars is really what they say it is;a face on Mars. Most belivers in the alien world believe that aliens did do it, while most scientist do not. I am a scientist at NASA working on the \"project\" and most scientist believe that it was just a giant mesa or a \"mountain\" or something that was formed by natural effect.\n \n I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that. In April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia, for the first time ever, and snapped a very \"sharp\" picture of the \"site'.\n \n Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.\n \n The belivers in aliens were still not satiisfied on the image they had seen on the internet due to the weather that day. Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the \"reasearchers\" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.\n \n After they had gotten the second picture they \"blew it up\" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids. The picture acutally showed that it is the, Martian equivalent, size of a buttle or (a. k. a. a mesa) which are landforms most commonly made by nature in the American West.\n \n \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Gavin. \"Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n I hope this has convienced you to believe that the picture is real and that aliens did not build it and that the pictures and people that have spoken told you that it is just a natural landform that was created by \"mother-nature.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars became very interesting in the time when it was found. The day the picture was taken was a very shodowy day, as it is said in the article the photo was taken in April a usual cloudy day in Mars. The camaras back then focused less than what our camaras do now. On April 8, 2001 when the picture was taken again it was summer and a cloudness day in Mars. When they saw the picture it was just a mesa. You have to understand that the time has pased and camaras have changed so in 2001 the camaras were better. So later on we can understand why because of the clouds that especific moment the mesa could of looked like a face.\n \n Now that you have learned that it was all just that the camaras back then were a little blury, now you have to now that the Face on Mars was just a natural land form. First the article states that mesas or a butte are also just a common land form. This kind of landforms are also found in the earth around the American West. The whole Face on Mars was just caused by a natural process in Mars, by the weather. So now you have learned that all of this was a natural process of a masa that day they took a picture and it happend to look like a mans face.\n \n After all of this research that scientist have found, we have all learned the real image of the Face on Mars. Yes this first discovery or thought brought a lot of popularity and fame but now we now the truth. It took lots of time and years to come to this point scientist will keep searching for evidence but we all know this was all just a natural land form and a picture taken at a right time.",

    essay: "Although it may seem that there is a \"face\" on Mars, there isn't. There have been conspiracy theories that the \"face\" on Mars is part of the remains of an alien, but that is not true. There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.\n \n After studying the \"face\" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the \"face\" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the \"face\". There are many other theories of what the for may be.\n \n I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the \"alien head\" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the \"face\" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the \"face\" was real, but can you always trust magazines. Magazines will lie sometimes so that they get a story that people will want to read. You can't really determine that the \"face\" is actually a face.\n \n In conclusion, the \"face\" is not a face. Although it may have seemed like a face to a lot of people, it wasn't. Later on this will be a time to laugh at because some people actually thought that the rock formation was a face.",

Because through disoveries in technology we have discovered that the \"face\" on mars is not a structure made to look like a human it is simply just a mesa.\n \n The evidence in the passage supports my thesis because it states that since the original photo was taken in 1976 when they were looking for the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2 places to land they saw the \"face\" \"NASAÂ’s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" NASA have been taking pictures and researching the \"face\".

NASA shortly after discovering the \"face\" realized that it was just another martian mesa and the facial features that it had were just shadows as stated here \"the sensation was short lived.

    essay: "Twenty-five years ago a photo was taken of a natural landform that appears to look like a face. Many people will argue that it isn't a natural landform but, more of an alien artifact. While the two sides still don't see eye to eye they both have evidence that could support their belief.\n \n While, some people think that the face on Mars is \"bona-fide evidence\" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was \"important to the taxpayers\" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.\n \n So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.\n \n While NASA hasn't changed there opinion because it is in fact just a landform. Many people still want good proof that it could quite possibly be acient civilization. So, they prepared to send up another. This time they sent it up on a cloudless summer day so that no-one could argue that the weather affected the pictures. NASA was right again. This time they took up a camera that zoomed in the structure and it didn't show anything new that would have meant that there has ever been any life there.\n \n All together, these facts prove that it is just a landform. A scientist named Garvin was quoted saying \"That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The face is indeed just like a landform that we have here on Earth. Although the other side of this long running debate did have some evidence that might have made NASA think twice, there is still more proof that it is a landform.",

    essay: "Face The Landform?\n \n Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.\n \n First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that \"face\" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.\n \n After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.\n \n Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.\n \n So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.",

    essay: "In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the \"Face on Mars\". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.\n \n When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that \"the Face\" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that \"the Face\" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.\n \n Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture \"huge rock formation...\" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of \"the Face\". The articles states the the image was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\". This image proved that \"the Face\" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph \"on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look\". It also says \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says \"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West\". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.\n \n The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that \"the Face\" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars. Who knows?",

    essay: "I have just read \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" and many people are convinced that the Face, found near Cydonia, is just a natural landform. However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.\n \n First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.\n \n Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,\" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.\n \n Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,\" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Also, paragraph twelve states,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West.\" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.\n \n In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",

The angle that they were at made shadows that looked like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The carma they were using at the time also wasnt that great.

    essay: "Mesa on Mars\n \n Who or what created this \"face\" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say \"the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This \"face\" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.\n \n To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it states, \"...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos.\" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...\" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.\n \n Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this \"face\" for what it is?\n \n Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars.\" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.\n \n Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the \"face\" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and \"sunny\". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been \"obducted by aliens\". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that \"scientists don't believe there is a chance of this\" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.\n \n All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa. All of these things proove that not only was \"the Face of Mars\" just a natural forming landform. Will you know the real cause of something like \"The Face of Mars\" next time you see one?",

Some time later after studying and researching the picture, we leaked the picture to the public so they could give us there thoughts about it because NASA always likes to here from the people. As soon as the picture was public lots of people where saying that it looked like it was created by aliens. It was attracting lots of people. But a big percentage of those people said it looked like an aliens face which was a Huge rock formation but they kept defending their statement. But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.\n \n Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so. The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement. On Mars there is that to, the only three things Mars dosen't have is oxygen, water, or any subtance of food or plants that make oxygen. The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars. The thing is that no one really could of created that without any food or water.\n \n I think after all the research NASA has done and the studying of the natural landform on Mars that was created by Rock Formation turns out to be ture and for evryone that thinks that me and my team at NASA are wrong well no i don't think i am wrong i think i am way beyond positive that we are right because NASA has done everything they can to bring the people the right information. The people that think the natural landform was created by alliens need to join NASA so they can come along see that NASA brings only the truth noting but the truth to the people. But NASA always trys to do there best to convince people to know the right information and to have the correct facts in hand.",

    essay: "The face on Mars is just another fake thing happening in this world. Honestly it is just another natural landform. Scientist might have been shocked when they saw it back in 1976 but know they are understanding and learning that the face is just a natural landform.\n \n The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.\n \n Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.\n \n This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.\n \n This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.\n \n The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.\n \n Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.\n \n When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.\n \n This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.\n \n The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.\n \n Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.\n \n Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.\n \n Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.\n \n This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.\n \n If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face.\n \n The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars.",

    essay: "In 1976, Scientists made a discovery on Cydonia,a region on the Red Planet. NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of the area, looking for sites for its sister ship, Viking 2. While it began to take pictures of the region, it spotted a human-like face. Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.\n \n It has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos. There was no alien monument, only a natural landform. Finally, they gave up.\n \n After eighteen long years of investigation, many researchers gave up on the Face. Many natural landforms disappear over time which is why scientists and researchers can no longer find it. Although, some researchers are still on the look out for the Face, hoping to find it again soon.",

Some people suggest that it was formed by alien life on Mars and some people believe that it is a natrual landform. I believe it is a natural landform because of what the scientists have found.\n \n The text states, ...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Not only was the Face formed but it was also and illusion. The text also states, \"...snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos...revealing...a natural landform.

Lastly, although not everyone was satisfied, the scientists had stated, \" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, it's hard work.\" This shows that just because the supposed \"alien markings\" were hidden by clouds or haze, doesn't mean they are alien markings. The text states, \" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, It's hard work...\" So to prove that the \" alien markings\" was just a natural landform, scientists took a second look and captured the best photo they have and proved that is was just a butte or a mesa which were \" common landforms around the American West.\" This evidence shows that is is a natural landform that is an equivalent to America's common landforms.\n \n I believe that it is a natural landform because of what scientists have found. Scientists have taken pictures and second looks of those pictures to prove that the Face isn't \"alien markings\", but a natural landform. All this evidence proves that the Face is a natural landform and while my evidence shows something else, there could be evidence that shows it is alien markings. So what is your view on the Face?",

The Face is just a rock formation, the fact that the shadows make it look like a face is simply just a coincidence.\n \n If you look at the picture of the Face, you can see the black shadows on the figure, if you were to remove those shadows, it would most likely not look like a face anymore. The passage says \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadowss that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" The passage also says \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Key word, illusion.\n \n The original picture shown in the passage wasn't taken at a very high quality.

    essay: "In 1976, Viking 1 took a picture of what looked to be a a human face on Mars. A few days later the picture was reviealed to the public eye, and it was starred in hollywood film movies, books, magazines, and talks shows. But in 2001, new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it was only a mesa. Though there are many credible reasons to believe that it was only a mesa, some people still believe that is an alien artifact.\n \n Yes, one might think that the mesa looks like a face from an egyptian Pharoh, but after closer examination, it was only a natural landform. We are able to prove this because on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Sureyor flew over for the first time, a picture was taken that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that showed only a natural landform. When the picture was unveiled to the public eye, it had a caption that told people it was a mesa that resembled a human face only because shadows that were on the rock gave an opticl illusion of eye,nose, and mouth. Also on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enogh for a second look and used the cameras absolute maximum resolution to take an even better picture that again showed that it was only a mesa. From these pictures alone you can tell that there wasn't a face on Mars and that there isn't any extraterrestial beings living on Mars.\n \n in conclusion, the \"face\" on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform that you can probably see on Earth. Also if there were to actually be life on Mars, it would be a major break through that would help better fund NASA, so what would be the piont in trying to hide it from the public that funds our research? There would be no piont in doing so which means that there isn't any life on Mars and the face is only a mesa or butte.",

    essay: "So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?\" the man asked. \"I'm not buying it.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" I replied, \"and I'm about to show you why I'm right.\"\n \n The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, \"I'm all ears.\"\n \n The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\".\n \n To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the \"face\" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, ' he added.' 'So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West.\"\n \n Furthermore, this set of information proves the theory of an alien artifact wrong. Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.\n \n \"Whatever, geek! You're just saying this stuff to put it in my head!\" angrily defended the man.\n \n \"The facts don't lie, my friend,\" I replied, \"there may or may not be life on Mars, but there certainly isn't a face.",

If this figure is mad eby natural causes on the planet it has faded away over the years. Most people around the world think this figure is made by aliens, This figure could have been made by the astronauts on the ships and they just made a figure and took a picture of it and made people think that it was made by aliens. This figure could have been made not even on the planet they could have took some clay or some other material and made a rock like face and said that they found it on the planet. This figure is probably a fake because how often do you go to a planet and just find a random rock that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up. If they do take another picture it has to have the shuttle to where you can see it so the people around the world can say it is in space. If there really is a face figure on that planet that might be a sign of life on the planet. Maybe the astronauts have found another planet with life it may not be human it may be im not saying that aliens are real but if there is life on that planet this whole world will be wanting to go up there and see for themselves. If there is life on that planet then people will pay big money to go up,also if theres life maybe we will go back up there and their might be another face figure.

    essay: "Did aliens create an amazing masterpiece on Mars or are you just imagining that they did? Aliens surely do not exist or are for sure not on Mars. It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.\n \n First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This \"alien created object\" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?\n \n Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.\n \n Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this \"plain\" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.\n \n It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.\n \n Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this. Wondering and believing are both good things but if you don't focus on the truth of reality, you will not suceed.",

I believe the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform, not every person in the world may agree but if you look at the facts and evidence together you will be able to comprehend the \"Face\" is not an aliens monument, it is a natural landform.",

    essay: "Face\" the Facts\n \n The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the \"truth\" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the \"Face on Mars\" is nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" it says \"...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.\n \n Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.\n \n Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.\n \n To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to\n \n In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.\n \n - E.M.",

NASA has sent numerous things into space but one in specific has caused a great deal of curiosity through out the world. In 1976, a NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, took pictures of Mars and something unusual happened. A face apeared in a picture. At first NASA thought of the possibility of it being a foreign life form. But that possibility was stopped when scientists found out that it was just another Martian Mesa. A common landform on Mars. When the pictures were released to the public, many thought that NASA was lying, especially conspiracy theorists. They thought that NASA didn't want the public to know about an alien life form. That was very irrational.\n \n Many people don't like the idea of space exploration because they say it's a waste of money. If NASA encountered foreign life forms, it would only be benefitial to tell the public because then NASA would gain popolarity and skeptism of the program would decrease. Many people would be curios about it and would want to know more about the race. Therefore NASA would have a better reputation and be more popular because of their discovery.\n \n Secondly,technology has changed significantly since 1978. The original picture looks more like the face than any other one because of the old technology. In 1998, the picture looks more detailed. In 2001, it looks even more detailed. In 1976 the camera that took the photo only captured 43 meters per pixel making it much less definated compared to the picture taken in 2001 that captured 1.56 meters per pixel. This technology makes it less of a face.\n \n Finally, because of the newer and more advanced technology, NASA's scientists could look further in to the so called alien face. After studying it, the scientists concluded that the \"face\" was a mesa. A mesa isnt't only found on Mars. It can also be found on Earth. There is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it even has the same height as the Face on Mars. The \"face\" is more of a natural landform than anything.\n \n New technoogy, comparable lndforms, and the explanation of how alien races would benefit NASA helped the space program prove conspiricy theorists and the public wrong. All of these supports are hard evidence that the face was a mesa in disguise. Although the finding of an alien race would be revolutionary, it's safe to say that the \"face\" isn't the discovery of one. We'll just have to wait until the future to encounter a race that isn't our own.",

    essay: "Since we had sent surveyors to Mars we have found many interesting things. We learned about much of the landscapes there and compared them to what we have here. Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa biom. The face in the area of Mars know as Cydonia is a mesa biom, so natural formations accur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa biom.\n \n The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not a alien structure. As it said in the article, \"Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact.\" They are the ones that truely study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique stucture that was naturaly created.\n \n The second reason is that the first image was burry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were cearer and prooved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.\n \n The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa biom. Things like this form all the time and should not be thought of a being made by anything other than nature. Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to accur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.\n \n There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa biom so this is natural.",

    essay: "As a scientist at NASA I strongly believe that the \"The Face on Mars\" is simply a martian from of a mesa, which is commonly found on Cydonia. According to the text \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This was of course after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydonia and captured a higher resolution image of \"The Face.\" In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.\n \n Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.\n \n In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon \"Mars martian face\" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere. There was no need for all the chaos and random conspiracy theories, all it need was a little bit of science and hard work.",

On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.\n \n First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the \"facial features\" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.\n \n Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.\n \n Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the \"face\". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.\n \n In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point. Scientists proved their point by explaining unusual shadows, confirming information with additional scientists, and taking countless photographs of the mesa.",

In this argument I believe that the Face on the planet Mars is not alien life, but is a natural landform that has formed over periods of time.\n \n I believe that the Face is a natural landform because of the information from the text.\n \n Starting of on May 24, 2001 when the Viking 1 space craft found the face when it was searching for an area for its sister Viking 2 to land.\n \n In 1976, the Face was not that clear at the time until 1998 when it started to take more shape.\n \n I believe that if it was not a natural landform, NASA would have probably kept quite about it until they offically knew that it was or was not a natural landform.\n \n Just because when it came, people are statring to think that the Face is \"bone fide evidence of life on Mars.\"\n \n If there was life on Mars, people all around the world would know about the it, and possibly would try to travel to Mars to see such life forms.\n \n Yet know has tried, we humans have only sent robots to do the work on Mars for us.\n \n On April 8, 2001 when they took the picture the second time, they have recievced a photo that they could compare to the picture that the Viking 1 took in 1976.\n \n I believe that it is just a landform because the qoute from Garvin when he said \"It reminds me nost of Middle Butte in thr Snake River Plin of Idaho\" so it must just be a landform creation when it can remind some on of an experience the already seen.\n \n In closing, from the facts from the story I believe that the Face is not alien life, but it is a natural landform that has been created over time.",

    essay: "The \"Face on mars\" is just a natural landform. Because of the unusual shadow on the Martian mesa it made it seem like there was a Egyptian Pharaoh's face. When NASA unveilde the picture for everyone to see they specificly said in the caption that it was a huge rock formation that resembled a humans face, but because of the shadows it gave the illusion of a human face because of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Which is not really possible for the people to believe that Aliens had created this because of all the pictures that where taken there was no picture with a alien life form. Another reason for this is that you can see things in the digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. That way if there were other objects on Mars than you would be able to see that they were. Which makes this statement true that that it was a natural landform and shadows that had created this face.",

    essay: "Many people still believe that the Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it's to hard to really know what the object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.\n \n Based on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn't mean it is that.\n \n Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west.\" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.\n \n The first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, \"the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze.\" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.\n \n Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, \"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.\n \n Based on research, and facts from, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars\"\n \n On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.\n \n Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.\n \n The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA\"s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.\n \n In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",

Even though the team did this, people still beleive that it was a face. The Face of Marshad become a very big thing for pop culture. It was on TV, was in books, and on the radio.\n \n We see things in everyday life like clouds. They remind us of animals, objects, maybe even memories. I cannot make a conclusion and say that cloud is a bunny and think that one day a bunny was in the cloud and it's face started to form. It is based on your perspective. To me, it looks like a natural landform on Mars but maybe to other people it looks like some type of ancient face. If people think it is an ancient face then people are going to ask questions then it creates an even bigger mystery. This was just coencidence.

    essay: "The face on mars is a natural landform, I know this because in the most recent picture there are many cracks in the formation. More reasons I know this is because aliens do not exist. The last reason of how I know Mars is not made by any type of alien is how would they know what humans look like. Most of NASA's people believe that it wasnt made, but is a natural landform. NASA was confident that it was a formation as well after posting it on their website they captioned \" A huge rock formation\" this shows that the majority of NASA believe this as well. I know no aliens know what we look like because we never seen any aliens orbiting or trying to take a photo. The way that I know aliens dont exist is because there are none that we've seen after years and years of study. In conclusion, I know that this wasnt made by any living thing and that it is a natural landform because aliens dont exist, they dont know what we look like, and NASA, who works on things like these every single day think it is a natural landform.",

Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.\n \n Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars.

    essay: "The face is just a natural landform and not evidence of an alien attack. There are many reasons why this landform is only natural and not any type of alien proof. One of those is that if NASA found a secret alien civiilization they would tell us because it would help increase their budget. Another reason that it's just a natural landform is because it is just like some other natural landforms on Earth and other mesa's on Mars. The last reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that NASA is scietifically trained and would know if it was proof of alien's existence but the conspiracy theorists aren't scientifically trained and would be less likely to know exactly what it is.\n \n The first reason that it's just a natural landform is that NASA would tell us if it was proof of an alien attack. It states in the text that \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" which shows how it would help increase their budget. Since the Face is so popular and has even become a pop icon if NASA were to find out it was proof of an alien attack they would most likely tell us because since it is so popular it would give them a significant increase to their budget. That is just one of the three reasons that I will b talking about in this essay.\n \n The second reason that the Face is just a natural landform is because it is just like other landforms on Earth and around that area on mars. In the article it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West\". That passage from the article shows that there are landforms on Earth that look similar to that one on Mars so it couldn't be proof of an alien attack. The article also says \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh\". That shows that other landforms that resemble the Face on that part of Mars isn't uncommon. The only thing that made the Face stand out from other landforms was the shadows which made it appear to have a face that looked like an egyptian pharoah.\n \n The third and final reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that the scientists would know better than any of the conspiracy theorists would so we should believe them. NASA has no reason to hide the Face from us because even if it was an alien attack, as I stated in paragraph two, it would help increase their budget. Other conspiracy theorists believe NASA is just trying to hide the proof of an alien attack but if that was what they were doing, they wouldn't have released a picture of the Face at all. Also when NASA realeased a new high resolution image in 2001 and a 3D altimetry of the Face, the landform no longer reseambled a face, which is proof that it is just a mesa.\n \n Those 3 reasons are the reasons you should believe scientists and not think it is an alien landform. NASA has nothing to hide since it would increase their budget. They also are more trained in knowing what landforms on mars are than any conpiracy theorists are. The other reason is because there are many other landforms on Earth that resemble faces which could be compared to the Face. Those 3 reasons are why we should all stop trying to make conspiracy theories and just believe what NASA is trying to tell us, that it's just a mesa.",

    essay: "Long ago, Vikings spotted a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. It was about two miles long and was located on a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some people are convinced that aliens on the Red Planet, but others would beg to differ. Most scientists agree that aliens are just a myth and they did not build the \"face. Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he \"face.\"\n \n For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the \"face\" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this \"face\" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face.\" Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.\n \n Still not satisfied with my argument? If not, listen to this. With all of the new technology these days, there is even more proof as to why there was no aliens who built the \"face.\" A camera took photos of the \"face\" with maximum resolution. With the high technology cameras, scientists could look at the photo three times as large as the origianl snapshot. Becasue the scientists can zoom in so much, they would have been able to see if there were any aliens on the planet. The picture actually shows Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, which are llandforms commonly located around American West.\n \n Most scientists would agree that there never was alien life on Cydonia. Thanks to technology, this point can be proven even further. Obviously, aliens did not build the \"face\" that is on the Red Planet.",

    essay: "Do you believe in aliens? In 1976 the Viking 1 spacecraft of NASA discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face! Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.\n \n The first reason why this \"face\" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.\n \n Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\n \n However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.\n \n So in conclusion the \"face\" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.",

Proving that the so called \"human face made by aliens\" was not only unrealistic but also doubting Nasa, who has been in work since the first time the United states landed on the moon. Reason two, why would you be doubting a group when they have been working on new technoligy for modern space traveling for a long time. Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the \"human Face\". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do. Nasa even had qualified scientists to make sure it was't an alien face and even confirmed it. The third reason is because on April 5, 1998 when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped pictures ten times sharper and confirmed it was just a natural landform. Once again in April 8, 2001 Nasa proved that it was not a an alien sculpture once again.

But multiple times it has been checked and everytime it was checked with a better camera. Multiple Nasa teams went through checking this out and still proved it to be a landform.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars\n \n The Face on Mars is a natural landform.\n \n The formation is just another Martian mesa. Many conspiracy theorists get too overwhelmed when they see this face, because they are so eager for scientsists to find life on another planet. Although it looks as if something made the Face, it was made naturally.\n \n First, the Martian mesa is very common around the area of Cydonia. It was not a big surprise to some scientists to find that it was formed naturally. NASA revealed the image captioning, \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The unusual shadows made the landform seem to be a human face.\n \n Next, the Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a photo that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This made the picture even more accurate. When the picture was first unveiled on a JPL web site, people found that the Face was a naturally landform. It was not caused by aliens or other life forms.\n \n Then, Malin's team took a clearer photo than the 1976 Vikining picture. Malin's team's captured a picture on April 8, 2001, in which each pixel spaned 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the Viking photograph. According to the article, you can distinctly view objects three times bigger in a digital image than the pixel size. In paragraph 11, the author says \"So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" The 2001 picture shows that the Martian is equivalent to landforms that are common near the American West.\n \n Ultimately, the research and pictures were clear, the landform was not made by any life forms. The Face was formed naturally. The Martian mesa is very common in the area of Cydonia, where it was found by. Scientists and their teams captured photos that showed that this was landform was caused naturally. With the technology the scientists like Malin used, it is easy to tell that there was no aliens that affected the mesa.",

    essay: "There has been an argument saying that the face on mars is a ancient civilization. Well they are wrong because it is an old landform. My three reasons of why it is a landform is because the planet Mars cannot support life. Also because it is just the lighting forming the eyes nose and the mouth and it is just a landform. I know it is a landform that has just eroded over hundreds of years.\n \n On Mars there is no oxygen no water or life that is because the planet cannot support life. The planet is compleltly dead. If there was a civlization then they would of had to of built a house with airlocks just to survive. Even if the Aliens did not need air to breath they would have gotten to hot and they need mosture to survive. And you would think that we would have found a civilization or something that would have kept them alive by now. In the text it says it would be cool if there was an ancient civilization.\n \n The landform looks like it has eyes a nose and a mouth but really it is just the lighting reflecting on the landform. If the sun is hitting the landform then it will cause a shadow to creat the look of eyes a nose and a mouth. But after many years the landform has eroded to form a face like look. Sense the planet Mars has allways been the closest to the sun. It is alot hotter than earth so there is allways heat waves so that is what caused the erosen on the landform. In the text it states that the eyes nose and mouth are just an illusion.\n \n This is a landform because the planet is completly dead. Mars cannot support life because it is too hot and it gets heat waves. Also the light refelects off the landform and creats a shadow of eyes a nose and a mouth. The landform has had many years to erode. In the text it states it is just a martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n It would be cool if there was aliens that created the landform. We could see how they adapted to surviving on the planet and its harsh conditions. They might help us addapt to Mars and we can help them adapt to our planet. But NASA would become more famous than what it is today. Because they would want to have all the land marks for artifacts and it would probably make the aliens mad.\n \n The landform on Mars was not created by aliens because we would have known by now. Also because Mars cannot support life the lighting on the planet creats the eyes the nose and the mouth like a illusion. And for all we know it is just a landform. I know it is just a landform that has eroded over hundreds of years.",

This region contains the popular \"Face on Mars\". The Face is believed to be an alien artifact.\n \n In 1976, scientists discovered one of the biggest wonders in the world ... \"the Face on Mars\". This happened during one of Viking 1 missions to look for a landing site for his sister ship, Viking 2. Scientists guessed it to be another \"Martian messa\", which was common in the region of Cydonia. After unveiling the image to all people, \"to attract attention to Mars\", many people believed that it was evidence for life on the Red Planet. Some people even said that \" the Face is \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide\" but, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\", which shows that NASA would actually benefit from an alien life form so they had no reason to hide it from the world.\n \n There are many facts that help support the fact that there is no alien life form on Mars. For example, in 1998: the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of the Face on Mars, which was ten times sharper than the Viking photos, that revealed the \"Face\" to actually be a natural landform. Still not all people believed, so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a second look of the Face. The picture was taken by a camera in which, \"each pixel in the image spanned 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" The picture taken by this camera ended up showing a \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" and not a face built by an alien civilization. In conclusion, you could still believe there to be aliens on Mars, but you would just be ignoring the facts that the scientist of NASA have presented in their photos of Mars from the years 1998 and 2001.",

    essay: "Did you know on Mars there is a face? Some people think it was created by aliens. Other people think it is just a natural landform on Mars. The face on Mars was first discovered in 1976.\n \n When they first saw it it looked like a \"shadowy likeness of a human face\". It was an enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end. When they first discovered it they saw it staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. I am going to be telling you why this is just a natural landform on Mars.\n \n When scientist first saw it in 1976, they thought it was just another Martian mesa which is common around Cydonia. They knew is was some type of landform. A few days later, NASA unvieled the image for all to see. The caption was \"huge rock formation which resembles a human head\". The only reason they said it was aliens, was to get people's attention. That is exaclty what it did.\n \n Eventually on April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia for the first time to check it out. While they were there Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. When the image first apperared on a JPL web site it revealed it was just a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was convinced it was just a landform. Many people still thought it had something to do with aliens. But, how could aliens have done it? No one knows.\n \n On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew a close enough second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,\"Garvin stated. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size\", Garvin added. \"So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" he added. They could tell there was nothing just the land its self. It could not have been aliens.\n \n What the pictures they actually took show is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common in the American West. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\", Garvin says. Garvin ended his statement with,\"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n Coming to a conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Even Garvin, the Mars Global Surveyor said it himself,\"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivlent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West\". The Face on Mars is really, just an natural landform.",

    essay: "You may think the Face is created by aliens, but it simply is not. You see, we here at NASA have been studying and researching other planets for years. Don't you think that with our intelligence, we would know if something that looks like alien evidence actually is alien evidence? We would not only let everyone know, but we would make a very big deal out of it. This is just a natural landform.\n \n I know it is silly that there is literally a face on Mars, but it's not as big of a deal as you think. Have you ever looked at the leaves in a tree or the coulds in the sky and seen something put together that resembles an animal or shape? This is kind of like that. It's cool, but it doesn't exactly mean the universe is trying to give you a sign of life. When we released these photos to the public, people thought for sure we were hiding something like we had an agenda to have an alien takeover. They said it was \"bona fide evidence of life on Mars\". Trust me, we wish there was life on Mars! That would be ground-breaking news! We are not hiding a single secret, and we are speaking the truth.\n \n Perhaps, of course, we will find life on the red planet someday. This landform is not evidence to support that moment. On a bright and clear day on April 8, 2001, we took a very high-detailed photo of the face. If there were any outstanding undeniable resemblinces to a human face, we would've seen it. It is much like any other landform from the American West, like a certain one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Truly any other butte or mesa, just this time its on a different planet.\n \n So, afterall, it's settled. This face-like landform on Mars is not a sign of any martians or aliens, sadly. Conspiracy theorists will go on with their unreasonable theories and we will stick to the cold hard facts, thank you very much. I hope you have realized just how wrong everyone has been and just how much more logical you should be thinking. Don't get me wrong, I and most workers at NASA certainly belive in aliens. This just isn't anything to get to excited about. Keep in touch, though, you never know when the next big discover will come about.",

This is because the landform was made naturally not by aliens.\n \n This shows that is is possible for the landform to be made naturally and not by aliens.

Many people believe that this face was created by aliens, and its not just a natural landform. But I can almost prove to you that this \"face\" was not created by aliens and is infact a natural landform.\n \n First, If the face-like landform was created by aliens why would that be the only mark? Usually if the face was created by aliens there would surely be a way bigger mark. As well as there would be plenty more marks surrounding that face. This proves that this mark is simply just a landform.\n \n Also, there is plenty of life-like landforms created with the surface of the area. Just so it happens to be on a planet doesn't mean there has to be a wild explanation to this landform. There is life-like landforms that sometimes look a a full body and there are some that look like half of a body. Many of those landforms have been scientifically proven to be just a landform. Also, with all the human shaped landforms we have all of them should be claimed to be created by aliens! Once again, there is no way this landform can be created by aliens.

When the photo was first released, many thought it was an alien structure and that it proved there once was life on Mars. NASA then worked harder to understand the strange picture and to change the opinion of skeptics who tried to make it an ancient temple.\n \n The first photo that was released was a low quality picture and the strange shadows gave it the look of a face. NASA began to obsess about the face and they began to get better and better resolution photos. It became more apparent that the face was just a mesa, which were common in the area. Skeptics insisted that NASA proves that is just a hill and NASA continued finding out more about the mesa. as the resolution improved, nearly all second-guessers were silenced. This happened because scientists were convinced that this landform was much like the Middle Butte in Idaho, which was most definately not made by aliens.\n \n The Face did change how some people looked at the possibility of life on Mars. After the initial controversy, it was likely that the \"alien\" building was just a hill. Some still are skeptical even with the overwelming evidence, but they are also drowned out by those who know it was just an optical illusion. NASA proved that if there was ever life on Mars, it did not make the Face.",

But contrary to what NASA believes there are were other people who said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n NASA thinks that it would have been important to tell tax-payers if it were to have been a true alien land mark, but since you did not recieve any information; you can assume it was just a natural landform. If there were to have been a sign of life on that planet (Mars) it would benefit NASA and the whole world would probably know. \"The face\" is located on the part if Mars called \"Cydonia\" which according to Jim Garvin \"Is not easy to target (paragraph 9).\"\n \n Mission controllers are preparing to go back and look again so they can try to prove that NASA is not trying to hide any evidence. It will not be easy. Mostly because we don't pass over the face very often.

Based on all of the facts that we have gathered here at NASA, the claims of this rock formation being created by terrestrials is simply not true.\n \n Here at NASA we have the equipment to tell us if it is terrestrial or not. One thing we discovered in our research was throughout the years that we have taken these photographs that the \"face\" has started to just look like a big rock. It was due to the shading that the \"face\" looked like it had eyes and a nose.\n \n We also discovered that the rock formation is much like some of the formations here on Earth.

Although in the picture we can see that it was clear.\n \n In conclusion with all of the facts we have found this is indeed not a face created by aliens. There is enough evidence to tell us this. If it was an alien structure then we would benefit from it. We could learn about how advanced they were, but this was not created by aliens.

    essay: "Three pictures were taken of this odd feature on the land of Mars. The reasoning for the interest of the pictures is because they think the figure of the shape is a face. The first time they saw it they were astonished and had many questions that they sent other spacecrafts to take pictures two other different times. I believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural formed mound and scientist need to stop listening to theories.\n \n One reason to stop looking for a civilization is because it is not important. Mars Global Surveyor even said that finding the face is hard work itself because we dont even pass over the Face very often. We don't need to wasting our time on something that is not going to affect us here on Earth. Also, after the discovery and the first picture was taken it was just a landform not an alien momument that some people predicted or hoped to be.\n \n Second, if you look at the pictures you see a difference in all three of them. If there was an ancient civilization wouldn't you think the pictures would be more extravagent each time after the first. What we see is the complete opposite of what was just explained. As each picture gets newer the face looks much more deteriorated than before. They face is practically gone by the third picture and there is nothing really of it to say that it was a face.\n \n Lastly, Even if there were airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or things smaller you could see them from the cameras. So don't you think that if there were people on the planet you would also see them as well in the other three photos.\n \n I can see where some people might be interested in the idea of there being people on another planet. It would be awesome to know that you could or can survive on another planet knowing if something happens to the one we are on now. We could even add more information on alien research NASA has been doing.\n \n In conclusion, the Face did turn out to be a mesa and or butte. The same thing as a mesa but a lava dome and just maybe happened to be the same height as the Face on Mars. Also, the pictures you could tell it wasn't a face the dome shaped thing didn't match the features of the far away picture of the Face.",

    essay: "If I was in this situation I would like tell them to take an even better camera. And my explanation for that is because if they want to have a more clearer picture then they should take another one up there. And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows. They might argue that im wrong because they might say that why will they need the technology and they might say like well we already have a picture and its a face. But it could possibly be something else. It could be a mountain with craters, it can be mostly anything. I also could be wrong becuase they do have a Mars rover up there so my theory can be wrong and it is a face all along. If I was the a scientist at NASA talking to someone about why the face on mars wasent created by aliens i would tell them that extra terrestrial life couldn't of done that because we dont have enough evidence to prove that they exist. But for now we don't know 100% that aliens did it or if metors hit it and it looked like a face or if aliens did it. And if aliens really did it then we need to get nother camera up there and see if there is any other life out there. Then the person who is asking that question would say \"havent you guys already put one up there and theres nothing\". Then I would come back and say then why do you think that aliens did it if we got nothing on the cameras that we sent up there.

Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.\n \n The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.\n \n \"But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?\" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform. The reason to not believe these movies and magazines is because they ignore the research.

In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a \"a Viking photo.\" I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.\n \n I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. In paragraph 2, the author states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah.\" I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing. In the introduction, it says, \"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa.\" If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.",

My colleague believes in superstition and conspiracies so he stated that the face on Mars must be of extraterrestrial origin. I said that was porposterous, but my colleague continued to try and convince me to no availe. I told my colleague there are many reasons why the some scientists and people thought the \"Face on Mars\" looked like a face. I then procedded to tell him my reasons.\n \n First off, cameras at the time were not as advanced as they are today. The cameras of the day would \"distort the image and it would only capture the major features of the butte or mesa. The most recent image taken of the \"Face on Mars\" in 2001 looks very different from the original image taken in 1976. If there was a actual structure left by aliens, modern cameras would be able to see it. The the more modern cameras of today are able to see the more defining features of a object.\n \n Secondly humans are remarkably good at seeing faces when there is not one there. When you look at a wall socket you can see what resembles a face when there is not one there. It is the same thing with the \"Face on Mars\". With the aid of shadows from the Sun, are ability to see faces when none are there, and the angle the picture was taken, the butte or mesa looks remarkably like a face or some alien made structure.\n \n In response to what I said my colleague had some things to say to try and disprove me. Due to my colleague believing in superstition and conspiracies he believed NASA and the government are hiding the truth from us. He stated they were hiding this from us because of what happened with H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds, which caused a massive panic. The government don't want another mass panic so they have been keeping us away from the truth that aliens exist. My colleague also stated that possibly alien markings were hidden by haze as some other theorists thing so. I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing.\n \n Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.",

    essay: "Natures Faces\n \n There are many reason to why the face is just a logical thing that can happen. It could've been buttes or mesa landforms that are located in the American West. Also, there is no reason NASA would have for trying to hide something so major from the world. Lastly, if their was aliens on mars, wouldn't their be more evidence supporting the aliens instead of nothing?\n \n Garvin from Mars Global Surveyor, talks about how it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho as stated in paragraph 12. Anyone could go to Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho and see for themselves if they look alike. A simple way to put it is that their are so many things this \"face\" could've been other than aliens. Which is why most people don't believe in this \"theory\" because it is far from practical.\n \n Although NASA could hide what they saw at Mars, why would they? There is no reason for NASA to keep anything they discover a secret, or try and hide anything from us. NASA wouldn't have even shared the photo if they felt that they didn't want for anyone to know, to stir up this controversy in the first place! The astronauts were most likely just as shocked as we were when they saw the image.\n \n Lastly, there isn't enough evidence to infer that there is any type of life form on Mars. In paragraph 9 of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" it talks about how it isn't easy to target where the face is. If the face was a form of life there would be more, and it probably wouldn't be so hard to find. Most likely there wouldn't be one face but many.\n \n Even with every fact in the world there are still the great questions we all have from time to time. Even with the facts we all know about. Though I think that there is no possible way there could be any existence on Earth. You could always say \"what if.\" Which is why I hope you take my words into accountance when you think about the face on mars.",

    essay: "That photo is not an alien. What photo am I talking about? The photo the NASA took of the \"face\"that is shown in a lot of places. In the arcticle its says,\"The Â“Face on MarsÂ” has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showsÂ—even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not. It is not an alien because it is just a natural land form, it is hard to target(because it never moves, small and blends in with all the rest of noraml mars), and people say it looks like a normal natural lava dome (and it does).\n \n It is just a natural land from. It is only shaped like a face. There is nothing odd or strang about it besides the shaping. It just happened to look like a face. In the texts it says, \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" This shows it had nothing to so with aliens, it was just a land form.\n \n If it was a living thing, or used to be living shouldn't move around?Â“ItÂ’s not easy to target Cydonia,Â” says Garvin. This shows it is one spot and small. It also proves it blends in like in other natural land form would do. If it was something special you would think it would be easier to find. If you don't look very closly you don't even see the face at all.\n \n Not only is it natural land, but it is also reminds Garvin of a lava dome of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,Â” says Garvin. Â“ThatÂ’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.Â” This again proves if you ignore the fact that it looks like a face, it looks completely normal. It looks like a normal thing any planet would have, even earth.\n \n Some may agrue it looks to much like a face to not be something like an alien. Even though it is funny how much it looks like face, there are too many facts proving it isn't anything different from everything else on the planet mars. It just happened to be the way it formed it looked like a face.\n \n There are many things proving, this thing on Mars is not an alien or created by aliens. First, it is just like anyother land form, just a \"werid\" shaping. Second, it blends in, is small and doesn't move. (This makes it hard to target.) Finally, it reminds people of a lava dome, again showing it is just shaped weird to us. The face got the attention of the public for a while, like the text said,\"The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" But, everyone needs to let it go because it is nothing to talk about since we now know the truth. It was fun for a while, but if you still believe it more than a normal part of mar's natural land, you will look like a fool. I guess we will have to keep looking on other planents to find live or \"aliens\" because so far it is for sure not on mars!",

    essay: "Have have you ever wanted to learn more about something like about a person or maybe... a planet? This essay is on unmasking the face on Mars, is it real? or fake?\n \n Well is is in fact real in here are the reasons why.\n \n First, it is real because Twenty five years ago we spotted something weird happening on Mars. One of our spacecrafts, The Viking 1, was getting pictures of what may be possible land sites for its sister ship, The Viking 2. It was then that we noticed something strange, it was like a shadowy likeness of a human face. It had an ENORMOUS head nearly almost two miles end to end. it ALMOST looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n Next, a few days later we unveiled the image for everyone to see...even though we were not sure how everyone would react. But to NASA's surpise, everyone loved it it was in movies, books,magazines etc. There were some people out there who didn't belive it, said it was probably fake and that we were just trying to scare people into thinking aliens were real. But it was real alright and we have the evidence to prove it.\n \n Third, even though few scientists believed it to the Face of an alien artifact, the photos of Cydonia became important to NASA when the Global Surveyor (MGS) to the Mars in September. After 18 years, the Viking missions ended. Not every one was okay with though. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north latitude, it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of the year on Mars. We tried to take a look at it one more time but it was to late. When the cloudiness ended on mars we had put another spacecraft on Mars. when we got pictures back you could then all the detail and more on the face.\n \n Even though some people may still not ever believe it, we just want them to just acknowledge the thought of '' What If?''. Then maybe they could see that this really is an anicent alien mark.",

Well stop, because that is false information. Just read this short essay and change your mind about the subject of aliens.\n \n In 1976 the Viking 1 sent a picture of a supposed face. NASA, shortly after getting the image, then made a false testimony stateing that an alien carved face is on Mars. The now famous image of Mars took a name The Face. Now twenty-two years later NASA tries again at a picture of The Face. The picture turns out good, but a cloud blocks a part of the image. The people aren't happy and they get NASA, three years later to get another picture, and it it shows no evidence of an alien carved face. The talk of The Face soon dies down.\n \n So to sum up what happened, in 1976 the Viking 1 sends a picture of a \"face\". NASA states that this is an alien's doing. The image recieves the name The Face. Twenty-two years later NASA tries again, and gets a good picture, but a cloud blocks the right side. The people aren't happy. Once again NASA takes another picture, and there is no face. So after reading this you still have your opinion, or you just changed it, but I firmly believe that alien life is a hoax.",

    essay: "The Face is a natural Martian mesa, like many others. People have wondered if aliens have built it before, but they had no proof. NASA has already proven with evidence it is just a natural land formation.\n \n First, NASA decided to release the pictures of the Face for the public to see, but they only did this to get more people intrested in Mars! To prove that the Face was just a land formation naturaly made, NASA decided to show better quality photos to the public. So they sent out pictures that were ten times sharper to show it was a ROCK formation. Also if there was life on Mars NASA would benifit from it, so i dont see why they would lie.\n \n Next, Mars is a planet with many unknown discoverys but the ones that NASA do figure out the more information we gain for the future. For example in the text it says that Mars has many Martian mesas, so it could be a coinicidence that ONE looks like a face. This doesn't prove there isn't life on Mars but for the information we have at the moment it is doubtful.\n \n Lastly, There are many people in the would who make this stuff up, so why would believe THEIR opinion over NASA who research on space. Don't forget that the only reason they got the information of the Face was because NASA unvieled it. If they had something they didn't want us to know about they would have kept it to themselves.\n \n The Face is just a rock formation. Others might say something like it looks like a human face, or why would it look like a face if the life on Mars hadn't built it. The reason it looks like a face is because the mesa formed that way. It couldn't even have been built by life on Mars because it's over 2 miles wide, so it has to be a land formation.",

Providing evidence is not just having a theory with people backing you up. Evidence is providing proof, proof is pictures lab tests and finding all possiblities that that is the only thing it could be. The article however cannot provide proof or hardly any evidence there are living things on Mars.\n \n The article does provide a picture, but the picture is nothing but a mear misunderstanding. The picture provided is what is called a lava dome, simply shapes creating the form of a face. People like to take little things and make them into something just because they can. Many people are making a large amount of money off of this discovery and that's what people are after now, people care about money and publisity. This scientific breakthrough is nothing but a scam really.\n \n People want to believe what they hear and so most of the time they will. Things can be photoshopped now a days with all the new technology so I suppose you can never know for sure. New discoveries are scary and scientists will keep on discovering the world and even whats outside of our world but there's no gaurentee this is a real ailen artifact.

Angle is everuthing, angle can make something look like it actually isn't, it plays tricks on your mind and your eyes.\n \n Maybe this is a mark left by an ailen and if so scientists are ready to let out all the truth because the public isnt ready for something new, something unheard of. The only thing the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or a mesa, landforms common around the american west, does this mean aliens are also on our planet? I think not. There is no life on Mars proven what so ever and all that this picture is is a misshaped landform misrepresented. The picture provided is nothing more then a shape that people are claiming is an alien artifact but in the end there still isn't enough evidence to support that claim.",

    essay: "How do you think the Face was formed. There could be many reasons how the Face was formed. However I think that the Face was not formed by aliens. One reason is, is that they haven't prove that aliens are real yet. Also, that the day they took they picture they said that there was wispy clouds over it. Another reason is that it all happend because of science.\n \n Mars is an odd planet, I've heard people call it the pizza planets because it was red, I think. That's not the point though, the point is, is that the planet has not proven that aliens live on that planet. The face had been thought it was created by aliens. NASA said that the Face was a \"huge rock formation\" showing the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. There are more reasons why they face was Face was not formed by aliens.\n \n Another reason is that the day they took the picture, there was wispy winds. In order to take a good picture you need to have good weather. The weather can effect the picture because if it's windy you need to make sure that everything is not blowing around. The wispy winds could have effected the picutre becuase the winds were blowing so the rocks, sand and everything else was blowing around. So, when Viking 1 captured that picture, it can everything else blowing with it. Wind storms happen on planets, I am not sure om which ones but i know they happen-just like how on the sun it doesn't have wind storms but has almosr like volcanic action on it with lave everywhere. There is one more other reason.\n \n One more reason is that is just plain old science. Science occurs in a lot of discussing and working on the planet. When planning to send some sort of machine to a planet, you have to undertand the planet. In 1976 there wasn't the best technology at the time. They didn't know when a storm was gonna come or if they would have to send their machines threw a bunch of metors. When they sent out Viking 1 a win storm occured and the camera on Viking 1 couldn't focus right and that is why it looked like a face.\n \n There are many more reasons why the Face was not formed but an aliens. Some are that it was that aliens have not been proven yet. Also, that there was wispy clounds. One more is that is was all science. Those are resons why that the Face was not formed by aliens.",

It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away.

    essay: "Do you really think the \"Face on Mars\" was created by aliens? The \"Face\" is nothing but an ordinary landform of Mars. Pictures, common sense, and science have proved that.\n \n First, there are pictures that show what the \"Face\" really is. The \"Face\" is nothing but a common mesa(2). The mesa just looks like a face because of a coincidence.\n \n Second, any person would know that NASA would rather have money than another secret. The discovery of alien life on Mars would be very rewarding in cash, and the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars(5). They want there to be an ancient civilization because it would mean tons of money for them.\n \n Finally, science proves that theory to be completely wrong. There have been absolutely no signs of any life whatsoever on Mars(7). If there's no life to build it, how can it be built by life?\n \n As I said, the \"Face of Mars\" is nothing but a common mesa. All of these reasons have proved that. Now, if you excuse me, I have to get back to my research.",

    essay: "Space is a strange place with an unlimited amount of possibilities, one of which is the possibility of alien life. Because of this, I can understand why you might think that this is evidence of alien life. In hopes of debunking this suspicion, I am hoping you will read through my provided evidence that supports my claim that this \"face\" was not created by aliens.\n \n First off, NASA would not be trying to hide the existence of aliens from the public. Their budget is primarily based on the tax and donation of those who are interested in space. If aliens were to exist, and NASA knew this, telling the public would give their budget a massive increase. So, to dismiss the accusation that NASA is hiding proof of evidence from you, I assure you that they would have told us just to get the much needed rise in their budget.\n \n The picture of the \"face\" was taken forty years ago, just seven years after we first landed on the moon. As stated in the article, this was, in fact, the best resolution they could take the picture with. If you put two and two together, you can conclude that the highest resolution at the time was not very high at all compared to modern day photos.\n \n Finally, you must take into considerationg that Mars is just like Earth, a planet. This means that it will have geographical land marks just like Earth. This \"face\" has been confirmed to be butte or mesa, which are common here on Earth, as said in the article. If we were to colonize Mars in the future, and someone were to observe Earth and see such a land formation, do you think they'd call it proof of aliens? Of course not!\n \n With the evidence I provided above, I hope you are able to make your own conclusion. As said before, the vast emptiness of space is impossible to predict, and the existence of aliens is likely. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want to believe when it comes to aliens, so I am only able to hope that you are convinced by my essay.",

    essay: "On May 24, 2001, NASA discovered a large, shadowy figure that resembled the shape of a human face on the surface of Mars. Some are to believe this figure was created by \"aliens\". Was it? Or is this mysterious likeness just something as normal as a natural landform?\n \n Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976. The camera's absolute maximum was 43 meters per pixel. By looking at the photograph, you wouldn't be able to make a definate conclusion about what exactly the figure was and how it got on the surface of Mars.\n \n Later, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was able to capture a photograph with an absolute maximum of 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters per pixel like in the 1976 Viking photo. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. Jim Garvin even said, \"You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n Garvin also mentioned that they don't pass over the figure as a face very often and that what the image actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West.\n \n Like I mentioned in the first paragraph; some are to belive this figure was created by aliens. Was it? Well, after receiveing all of NASA's evidental information, I would have to say it was not. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform created by natural causes; not aliens or even previous human life that may have once exhisted on the mysterious planet. People may have been hoping this was the time in history where aliens could've been discovered, but as we can tell, that moment in history is certainly and obviously not now.",

    essay: "Landform, Not Aliens\n \n The \"face\" on Mars has been a topic of discussion for almost twenty-five years. Was it created by an unknown species of aliens? Definitely not. Although, some people do think that, the \"face\" on Mars is actually just a natural landform that happened to be shaped like a face. Obviously, the \"face\" on Mars is a natural landform, not something created by aliens.\n \n To begin, the \"face\" on Mars is just a natural landform. What else could it be? Some say it was a statue built by aliens. But, that can't possibly be true. There is no proof that aliens exist in the first place, so how could a species that doesn't exist build a statue? Also, NASA released information saying that it was just a huge mesa forming into the shape of a face. The shadows just give it the illusion of eyes and a nose. Finally, the pictures of the \"face\" obviously show that it is not a built structure. It is just a natural landform on Mars. The pictures get clearer each time they were taken, so it is very apparent that the \"face\" is just a huge formation of rocks. So, all of this shows that there is no possible way that the \"face\" on Mars was built by aliens.\n \n Although, I do understand why people could believe the \"face\" was built by aliens. It does look like it could be a monument, like the ancient Egyptians built for their people. However, life does not exist on Mars; therefore, the \"face\" could not be built by aliens. Also, some people think that aliens do exist on mars, and that NASA is just hiding it. But, why would NASA hide that they found an alien civilization? That could only help the company, not hurt them. And, if you still don't believe me, if there were aliens on Mars, wouldn't we be able to or have seen them by now? Once again, I say that the \"face\" on Mars is just a mesa that gives the illusion of a face, not a statue built by creatures that don't exist.\n \n In conclusion, the \"face\" on Mars is just a natural landform, not something that was created by aliens. In the future, we might find out for certain what that \"face\" is. We aren't one hundred percent positive it is a mesa, but we know it wasn't aliens. I will be thrilled to find out what it is soon, and I think you will be, too.",

    essay: "The face was not created by aliens for many reasons. An example would be how NASA wanted to take a picture, to reasure the American people. If it was created by aliens NASA wouldn't want to be taking pictures of it. Also it wasn't kept a private matter, NASA wanted all to see the face. Anothere example would be how NASA went out of there way to prove there cliam. Mission controllers stated that \"it was not easy to target Cydonia\". \"In fact it was hard work\", NASA stated how they didn't pass over the face very often. The last example would be how NASA took the picture a such high quality for the people. The article states that the team used maximum resolution for the photo. Back when the first Viking photo came out the quality wasn't as advanced as it was in 2001. I think the quality of the photo helped the American peole to understand NASA's cliam.

    essay: "Have you seen the \"Face on Mars\"? If so, do you believe it is natural or created by alien activity? Many people believe the face is evidence of alien life however this is probably not the case. The Mars Global Surveyor ,a mapping spacecraft, has passed over the area few times. However the few times it has passed over there has been no evidence of any form of alien civilization. This led us to believe it is just a natural landform.\n \n This all began when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars. Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible landing sites for his sibling Viking 2. In the midst of doing so Viking 1 spotted what looked like a human face. This was extraordinary because it was on planet Mars! When the images were leaked it led the public to believe that this is evidence of life outside of Earth's atmosphere.\n \n This might not be the case however. NASA believes that the face is just a natural landform similiar to a butte or mesa on that of Earth. There was a lot more evidence pointing towards the side of NASA but that didn't put peoples hopes down. Some of the public hoped and believed this was in some shape or form, evidence of extraterrestriel life.\n \n The pictures of the \"Face on Mars\" that NASA had were actually kind of foggy. They were foggy because the Mars Global Surveyor had to get the photos through clouds. This then led people to believe that NASA was hiding something in the fog. They thought they were hiding the evidence of life. NASA, however wanted to show them this was not the case.\n \n NASA then ,a few years later, passed over the face on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, and rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. NASA eventually captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. This photo cleared up a lot of confusion.\n \n As NASA studied the photograph, they came to realize that the Face was in fact caused by natural means. They then leaked the image to the public and cleared up confusion there too. However, there will always be that group of nay sayers. This group still wanted to believe that the \"Face on Mars\" was evidence of alien life. They still might believe that to this day.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" has caused a lot of confusion and mystery in the world. Many believed it was natural from the beginning and others not so much. Some have even grown to believe it was natural other than caused by aliens. Of course there are people still on both sides and as of right now we will never completely know the truth. We will know the truth when we go to Mars. Until then everyone will hold their peace and glorify at the mysterious \"Face on Mars\".",

From 1976 to 2001 we have found zero life on Mars. We have made many missions to it and we still have found nothing. Besides those reasons i still disagree with you about it and i do have proof of my reasons why.\n \n The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" tells me that scientist Jim Garvin was one of the men that took the picture of the \"face\" inApril 8, 2001. After Jim takes the picture and tells everyone, \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" Jims says this because, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\n \n Also there are unusual shadows to make it look like the landform has eyes and a nose. The shadows also made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But you have to remember that these are shadows and they dont tell always make out to what things look like. Sometimes your shadow makes you look taller than what you really seem to be. Shadows also dont always make you look the same either.\n \n Plus Martian Mesa, are common enough around Cydonia.

    essay: "Mar's Face\n \n Many people think that Mars has life living on it. One example would be the two mile long landform, the Face. People have been wondering for years what this odd shaped landform is, could it be an alien statue or just a natural landform. The Face is not an alien formation, but a natural landform.\n \n When NASA sent Viking 1, in 1976, to photograph Mars. They took images of the landscape there and stumbled upon a newly forming mesa or butte. Once NASA brought the images back and analyzed them. They found that the Face was nothing more than a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that made it look like a face.\n \n Then, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the region again. They snapped several pictures of it, at a ten times higher resolution, I might add, and analyzed these new images. They finally put their images on the internet and revealed to the world, that the Face was nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n Finally, in 2001, NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor a second time to photograph the Face. The team at NASA used the highest possible resolution to photograph this controversial piece of Mars. They found that the picture shows the, \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,\" which are are also found in the American West. NASA's chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program says,\" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\"\n \n Some people think that the Face provides evidence for life on Mars becasue NASA could not get a good shot of it. They do have a point that it would be hard to get a clear image of the Face with challenging weather. Yet, NASA has proven over and over again that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation.\n \n The Face is nothing more than a natural landform and not an alien formation. Scientists found that is was a Martian mesa but the unusual shadows made it look like a face. NASA also found that it was nothing more than a natural landform and the Face looks very similar to buttes or mesas here on earth. Others think that NASA could not have gotten good pictures because of the weather, but NASA has proven that the Face is just a natural landform.

Well i beg to plead the opposing side see what you have seen from 1976,1998, and 2001 is technology has proccesed this and its clearly nothing but a mark. Your conspiracy will live on if this was a life form why would it only be one life form? where are the others there are no trace of them a form of life can not just be created by nothing it has to reproduce. There is only sign of one so there for it does not exist as of the evidence given it is simply just a mesa, a mesa is a rock formation.\n \n this is just a coincedence that it looks of so nasa revealed they wish there was life form to give us more to study of but not much evidence comes from a plain old rock that looks like a face. in conclusion you personally will not change your mind about this becuase it a conspiracy life has been held up by this making money off of this rejoicing of nothing but a rock. Just like area 51 another conspiracy theorys where there is claimed to be unexposed life form when really its just a testing site for us millitary. Also the illumanati claimed to be the ones running the music industry and society. there many conspiracy theorys, but maybe just maybe theyare controlling us of what they dont want us to know making people think the conspiracys are a joke when in reality they are true.

The face was nearly two miles in diameter and it appearded to be staring back at the cameras from an area of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some say that this is evidence of life on Mars.\n \n In paragraph 2, they tell us that the sensation was short lived. It also says that scientists assumed it was just another Martian Mesa because it was so common around Cydonia. This one had shadows that made is look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. They should not have came to the conclusion that there is life on mars only becuase they saw shadows that resembled a humans facial structure.\n \n In paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998,\n \n Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took photos that would come out 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument. If there really was an alien monument to begin with, it surely would have appeared the second time around, especially because they used a much better camera.\n \n In paragraph 12, it says that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West.

That is a lava dome that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars is most likely a natural landform. Martian mesas are common around the Cydonia area so it could have easily been mistaken for what appeared to be a human face. They claim to have seen evidence of life based on shadows that appeared on a natural landform. This seems very unrealistic. Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team took photos using a camera that would leave pictures 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking pictures, so if anything was actually on Mars, we surely would have seen it.",

    essay: "A butte and a mesa these are all natural things on our planet Earth. So why do you think that the planet Mars also can't have these things. Earth is covered in these mesas so more than likely other planets including Mars probably have buttes and mesas, its just coincidentall that it looks like a face. With the other pictures it proves that the mesa isn't an alien artifact and just a natural landform.\n \n If you go out to the Rocky Mountains and look around you can probably see tons of Mesas maybe not as big ,but they are still the same natural landform. The mesa is big and does look like a face at first glance ,but there is no way you can prove it. But for scientists you can back it up with facts not just opinions.\n \n If you look at the image taken from the spaceship Viking 1 from 1976 you can see that only looks somewhat similar to a face. And then 22 years later a picture from a Mars Global surveyor you can see that it very clearly isn't a face and instead just a natural landform.\n \n The only way that this could be an alien artifact is if the martians are inside of it or underneath it. That would explain how the camera can not see any other buildings around the object because they are all inside of it so no one is outside. They also could be inside of the butte because the planet is deadly for some paticular reason and they have shelter inside safely away. And another reason is because inside of the planet there may be some source of running water that is keeping them alive.\n \n Although this could not work because they more than likely would have gotten a picture of a martian outside doing something. And they would need some source of water which has already dried up on the outside of the planet.\n \n In the end it is not possible that the mesa is an alien artifact and is instead just a butte or a mesa that happens to like a face. Because the clearer picture shows that it now looks nothing like a face, water stopped flowing on the red planet a long time ago, and Earth also has these land forms all over the place.",

    essay: "NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's \"sister\" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that \"so called aliens\" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there.\n \n One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.\n \n That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. Notice photo two? Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars.\n \n If you still do not believe me, then this next part will. If you think about it, why would NASA keep an amazing discover like this a secret? The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their \"face\" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.\n \n In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their \"face\", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.",

No one know how it become a human face or if it a human face at all, and some think the reason behind it is that there are evidence showing live in Mars. I agree that the shape is a human face shape, but I also believe is just a landform. The reason is that as it stated in the article, the face is to attrack the people. As Technology improved, the picture are showing the real image of the face which reveal to change it shape.\n \n The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money. According to paragraph three it said that,\"huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head... formed by shadowss giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth.\" Following the evidence is that also on paragraph three it say,\" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to enage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" This evidence tell me that with the idea of having a human face in Mars, it allowed people to think and believe what they told them.\n \n On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,\" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"The second reason is that the face was due to a land form. The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State. We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms. Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change.\n \n There may be live in Mars, and no one know that is true. In any case the Face of Mars might looked like a real human face, but if you look closely at the face that viking take in 2001, it doesn't look like a face. In the picture it show how the landform change it, and that the reason for why there are no Face in Mars. This argument will show you why the Face of Mars is just any landform like you see in earth.",

    essay: "Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.\n \n Strangley, the author of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\"\n \n suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was \"a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,\" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.\n \n Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?\n \n All in all, there is no \"true\" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what \"face\" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, \"Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.\" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.\n \n On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was. For instance, in the text the author stated, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West,\" and, \" Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.\" With all this said, the Face could have a slight chance of being real life; however, it is highly unlikely that it is true life on another planet.\n \n Ultimately, the Face shown on Mars is just a nautral landform. The Face cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence. All in all, life is changing all around us. New technoloy is being formed, but with a new generation who is ready to show the world what really is in the solar system. The future is in your hands. Find out what is next. Make your mark on the world.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars is a natural landform, though, some may think that it was created by aliens. NASA's research has shown otherwise. The Face was not made by aliens, but under natural circumstances. There were many high quality pictures of this landform taken and many scientist who studied them. Scientist have come to conclusion that the Face is just a natural landform that has taken a not so natural shape.\n \n Many people still believe that the Face is some sort of acient alien monument. These conspiracy theorists think that NASA is just trying to hide the evidence of life on Mars. As said in the article \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" (Unmasking the Face on Mars). Believers were still skeptical so, to be sure, NASA took more pictures of the Face that were clear to the eye. With these new high resolution pictures, as Garvin said, \"you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" Basically, if there were life on Mars we would be able to see even the smallest of things through these photographs. There was nothing unusal found.\n \n For 25 years conspiracy theorists have been questioning NASA's research. Specifically, on Mars and whether or not there is alien life on it. There have been movies and books that fanticize on the things that could possibly be living on the Red Planet. These theories are not backed up by knowledge and facts like NASA's. NASA's scientist are the best of the best when it comes to knowing abot outer space. These scientist have seen Mars, and the Face, in person. Most of the theorist have never left the planet. Lastly, there are many natural landforms like the Face on our own planet. An example of this is, Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho as pointed out by Jim Garvin.\n \n Outer space is the home to many mysteries bu, the fact that the Face is a clue to alien civilation isn't one. Even though the landform looks as if it could a ruin of a acient alien civilization, the facts have shown that it is not. Through studying the pictures and positioning of the Face, NASA's professionals were able to conclude that it was just a natural landform much like the ones found here on Earth. This does not mean that there is no life on Mars, it just means that the Face is not a hint to finding it.",

    essay: "In this essay, I will support my idea that the strange \"Face of Mars\" is just a natural formation. There is not to much evidence leaning either way, but I feel that it leans more twards being natural. We have not landed and investigated it yet. I have some evidence to support my idea. After reading this essay, I am sure that you will understand my point of view.\n \n I belive that the face of mars is natural. First, It is just a large rock formation that could have just occured naturally. Second, There is no other sign of life on mars. Third, It only resembles a face, it is not perfect. It is still controversial because we cannot examin it face to face. We only have the images that the space shuttles took from 1976 through 2001. Just because it is a formation on a different planet, it doesn't mean it was created by aliens.\n \n When God created the universe, did He say that He created little green men to live on the different planet? No. He said that the only intelligent being, with His breath in our lungs, that he created was use. Although, He did say He created the wonders of this universe. I would call the face a wonder, wouldn't you? God created one planet with the perfect design for life, and that planet is our home Earth. This is why I think that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform, and that there is no life on Mars.",

    essay: "As you know, as a scientist we come across many misunderstandings. The \"Face\" on Mars is one of them. This landform was created by natural causes; saying that it was created by a differrent lifeform is irrelavent. It's irrelavent because NASA would have a higher budget than we do now to explore further, if you take a look at the pictures the three are very distinct, and the third photo didn't show any other landforms, pyramids, houses, or lifeforms.\n \n NASA's budget is assgined to them by the new discoveries they find in outter space. If there were alien life on planet Mars we would've told the public, federal government, etc. because we want that extra money to discover more about it. Why would just hold on to that secret. We took a pictures of the landforms lets see how they turned out.\n \n As we compare the pictures of the same landform there are many differences. The 01' picture we took has multiple cracks and craters in the monument. I'm pretty sure the aliens wouldn't bulid a monument some place it could get beat up at. The 76' and 98' pictures were captured with not too good of a camera, causing it to have the appearance of a face.\n \n In 2001, we had created a camera with the highest camera quality we were able to obtain. We researched and studied on the camera itself to see that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of 43 like the other cameras. We came to the conclusion that we would be able to see any other landforms, lifeforms, ships, etc. ,but all of the above are absent.\n \n In conclusion, there was not any life shown on the picture, so it's irrelavent that aliens created it. We visit our monments. Why were there no aliens visiting thiers? One answer, they didn't bulid it.",

    essay: "Have you heard of the photo taken in 2001 that revealed a strange, unusual, \"Face on Mars?\" In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars in search for a landing spot for its sister ship. During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.\n \n The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, \"Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia...\" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.\n \n On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.\n \n Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,\" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.\n \n In conclusion, the picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa. I believe that this was an amazing discovery and gave us, NASA scientist, a challenge to go out and find evidence to prove conspiracy theorists's accustuations.",

    essay: "To many people, the Face is not an alien made landform. NASA has done plenty of research to find out what the Face was, and their research does not lead to that. The people who do think that this is an alien made landform have not done as much of the research to figure it out, since they do not have the same high technology equiptment that NASA has. Many people think that the Face was made by aliens, but I believe that it is naturally formed, and it just happens to look like a face.\n \n There is no real evidence stating that aliens are real, or that they have ever existed. There has been research done, but no clear evidence that they are real, leading to the conclusion that most people think that they are not real. The Face, to some researchers, looks like what is similar to a mesa or butte. This is a natural landform that looks like a landform you would typically find around the American West. The differences in the pictures over the years help explain why the Face is not alien made.\n \n The pictures over the years change gerastically. In 1976, the picture is pretty blurry, looks smooth, and almost resembles a face on a statue. In 1998, the picture looks a little more like itself, a little rougher, and it does not resemble a face as much as the first picture. Lastly, the picture in 2001 looks more like a landform and is a little rough, but it is a much clearer picture than the other two. The last picture still resembles a face almost, but I believe that that is just a coincidence. NASA did plenty of research on the Face.\n \n NASA has done a lot of research on the Face to prove if there is life on Mars or not. The Face was found by one of NASA's spacecrafts called the Viking 1, which was taking pictures of possible landing spots for the other spacecraft, Viking 2. They let the picture out to the public, which got really popular really fast. The Face was really popular for 25 years! After those 25 years, they decided to get a better picture of the face. The picture turned out to be ten times sharper than the original photos. The pictures showed that the photo was a landform. Some of the scientists were not satisfied, and had to get a better photo, which still showed that the Face was just a landform.\n \n The Face was a natural landform on Mars that happened to look like a face. Although many believe that it was created by aliens, the evidence shows that it is just a landform. The three pictures that were taken help compare and tell us why it was not alien made. There is no evidence stating that aliens are real, so it is not a valid conclusion to state that aliens created the landform. The evidence shows that the Face is, in fact, just a landform which coincidentally looks like a face.",

    essay: "Unidentified Object\n \n Scientific observations at NASA leads us to belive that the theory of an alien face on mars is fake. The idea that the object is anything more than a natural mesa on the planet is not backed up by proven facts.\n \n Theories of the mesa on mars actually being some sort of alien face or object have no proof. NASA has refrenses from our own planet to compare the object to, and high-resolution camers to photograph the object. While skeptics on the other hand, have nothing more than thier own personal beliefs. Unfortuianly the rest of NASA and other people in general belive otherwise.\n \n After researching the landform it saows resemblence of a mesa. The \"face\" actually had the researchers think of formations in the American West that would become a type of dome shape that would form from lava. That theory has a decent amount of real life facts compared to the alien theory. So far that is the best theory NASA has on what the object is.\n \n In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" whilst reading throught the fifth paragraph, they quote that defenders of NASA's budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars. This made me wonder why they would think that. It's because it would be more than just a landform like a mesa. They would have more to look into than just a face looking terrain. But being scientists they realized it was not as much as they'd hoped for. Therefore having no reason to lie about the mesa.\n \n However putting myself in the shoes of a person who wouldn't know about all these facts or opinions, I could see why these beliefs are taken seriously. But that's why we have researchers like NASA. To look into theories with more knowledge behind them and see how they turn out afterwords.\n \n After all the pictures, refrenses, and comparisons, the face of Mars should be known as a mesa, and not an alien artifact. However there are always more people that will belive it is alien. But that's just a theory.",

    essay: "You and your friends and family could often have arguments on whether something is real or not, such as in movies. Some might think one thing is special effects, others will think it is real. In Unmasking the Face on Mars, the author explains controversy of the \"face\" found on Mars' surface. It became an icon once it was released to the public. It was highlighted for decades and the society argued over it being an alien making, or just a land form called a mesa. The face was just a natural landform and it shouldn't have been thought as an alien form.\n \n The most logical answer to this was that it was a mesa, and that the shadows on the surface happened to make it look like a human face of an egyptian pharaoh. This struck civilization in the late 70s and caused a lot of arguments. The people that thought is actually was an alien structure were just people of the press who just wanted attention. A Mars Global Surveyor \" snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared an a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" This quotes directly states and gives evidence that it is just a natural landform.\n \n There isn't even any true or logical evidence that the face on Mars was an \" alien artifact.\" It was just a rumor that went around to keep things interesting and intrigue big movie companies. The cameras even took a picture with a ten times better resolution than the 1976 picture of the face. In addition, the new picture even had each pixel in the image span 1.56 meters in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel. Garvin talks that \" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" and that \" if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" Garvin directly states here that no matter what, the formation couldn't have possibly been an alien formation or even a pyramid. This is even more proof that it is ridiculous to think that the formation was an \" alien making .\"\n \n Although the face was thought to be alien, there is too much evidence that denies it, and that it isn't. Scientists would wish that it was an extra terrestrial sign, but the odds of that are too scarce to even consider. This was a very controversial topic, as I have stated before. All of the theorists out there had many different and unique opinions of it. The narrator says what the image \" actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landfroms common around the American West. \" It remeinds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Garvin.\" This evidence gives even further support that it isn't extra terrestrial, and states that it isn't, shich exposes that it is a fluke.\n \n The face on Mars was an ongoing argument for years to come once it was released to the public. There was no reason to do so. There was already valid points that gave proof of it being just a mesa. Things like this occurence happen all the time, even in your daily life. If things like this run across your mind, think about it the logical way and not a very, very unlikely path about it. There may be similarities between the sides, like in this argument. But, there was too much to show that it favored the more realistic side of it. The passage has multiple occurences where it directly states just that.",

    essay: "Switching Sides\n \n Have you ever heard of the man on the moon? Well Mars has a similar thing. They both ,at the time, had formations that looked like human faces. Some think it was made by aliens or some other superior being. However, the reality of it is that its just a natural formation that looks like a face. That part can be nocked out when you zoom up on it. The lines and basic formation of the mesa,the face, are too natural to be made by an intelligent species. Finally, if there was some marks or sign that it was created by aliens it would have shown up on the image due to the high resolution. We are looking farther then we should with this natural formation.\n \n At the moment the most recent picture from 2001 completly exterminates any facial recognition. You can see natural lines that run across the mesa and the higher elevation of certian areas. The eyes are just a steep hill that geos to the top. While the mouth seemingly isn't even there anymore. You can see the worn away parts indicating that its been there for quite awhile. The shadows aren't even there at the time which creates the distictive features. It bearly even looks like a face anymore.\n \n I was talking about the NATURAL lines that appear on the mesa. The lines on the mesa are to distictive to be created. If something made it they would have wanted smooth edges as well as an even ditch. If they tried to recreate the natural look it would have looked faulty and unbeliveable. The species would have completly deformed the hill exposing its true colors. Also what reason would they have for creating a random face with the possibility of no one ever seeing it. There is no point to it.\n \n Finally, the final reason for it not being alien-made is if there was marking on the mesa giving reason to believe it was created be aliens they would have been shown. If any wierd symbols showed up on the screen we would have seen it and still release the image. Why would we hide this from the world if it would increase the amount of funding we get from companies. You can study the image for hours, but not find a single symbol anywere on the image. The camera would have picked it up and we would have studied it.\n \n The mesa was not created by aliens if only looks that way to us because are minds are hardwired to find faces. Its much easier to remember a face rather than a name. Everything about the image is natural it wasn't put there for some unnoticable reason that we can't comprehend. It just existis thats all... nothing more nothing less. No aliens had anything to do with this mesa.",

    essay: "In 1976, a remarkable natural landform was discovered on Mars, a land form known now as, The Face. Scientist have debated on whether The Face is a natural landform or created by an ancient civilization on Mars. I believe this is really just a natural landform, and the reason I believe this is because of recent evidence. Reasons why I support this are, in 1976 picture quality wasn't as advanced as it is today and, this rock formation is similar to ones that occur on Earth.\n \n The Face, a huge rock formation, at nearly two miles long. This face like formation is also known as Cydonia. Cydonia in the mid 70's was thought to be a strange landform built by aliens. Although, really it's like any other naturally occuring landform on Earth. According to the artical \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" In the new updated picture of The Face, it is clearly seen as a land formation, not done by aliens.\n \n Then in 1976 picture of Cydonia was not as advanced as it is today. In the 2001 pictures, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo.\" This quote from paragraph 10 explains that, the picture power was very noticable different in the photograph from 1976 than 2001. This means that the pictures from 1976 are not reliable because of the poor pixel quality. Proving that The Face is just a natural landform.\n \n On April 5th, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor traveled to Mars and flew over Cydonia for the first time. These photos were said to be \"...ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,\" according to the artical.\n \n So on that day in 1998 people tuned in to find out the real truth. A quote from paragraph 7 in the artical states, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitng when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.\" In the end, it turns out that there was really no alien monuments.\n \n In conclusion, my claim is that The Face is just a naturally occuring landform. First, are Earth landforms that are similar, called mesas. Next, pictures took in 1976, are outdated and have poor pixel quality. Lastly, since April 5th, 1998 there are pictures proving that The Face is just a natural landform. Therefore making my claim true, The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform.",

It is either a human being or alien possibly inside of this planet with their face sticking out perminately.

As viking one took pictures, it came across a pecuiliar formation on the surface of the planet. The formation seemed to be an enormouse head similar to that of a humans. The scientist figured it was just another Martioan mesa, that was commonly spread throught the surface of Mars.\n \n Conspiracy theorists think that it is bona fide evidence that there is life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acncient civilization on Mars. And so on April 5, 1998 another Mars global surveyor flew over and took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. This led the the scientist to conclude and reveal that the face was just a natural land form and that it wasn't an alien monument at all.\n \n Some people were not happy. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. This was a coudy time of year on Mars. They had said that the camera the pictures had been taken with had to peer through clouds to see the Face. They believed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze at the time.\n \n On April 8, 2001, there was a cloudles day on Mars. The surveyor drew close for another picture. They said they increased the image quality to take the best picture they had taken of the face. They added that in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixle size you could see things like airplains, egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks.\n \n This showed people that it was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. This showed that the conspiracy theorists had been proven wrong. Since NASA actually researches theier data to learn more about it and they make hypothesize, it shows that they have a lot of since in saying that theorists are wrong. Theorist just make theories and they don't have anything to back them up if someone were to arugue about the subject. Conspiracy theorists are not always wrong but in this case they are.",

Now, since NASA is doing their reasearch they probably have a more than likely chance of being correct they've actually studied the object to see what it actually was. While these conspiracy theorist go with the common opinion about it floating around, and do no reasearch at all. The conspiracy theorists think that may NASA is hiding the fact that aliens have made this from the public because it may harm their budget. Taking this to 1976, camera resolution wasn't high enough to take good high quality photos yet because the technology was behind. The picture was blurry and it was one of those, \"you've got to see it to believe it\" moments because nothing could be made out from it. This is probably where that \"aliens made this\" conspiracy came from, the photo is so blurry looks as though some sort of alien space craft had landed here or the doing of aliens for artwork. Now, when you fast forward to 2001, you can obviously see more clarity in the picture. It almost looks as though this could be some alien artwork, but this is more than likely just a from a ship that has landed there and made this odd face like hole. Furthermore, if this was created by aliens it would be far more complex and wonderful than a face.\n \n In closing, this \"face on Mars\" and the fact that it may have been created by aliens could be true. But reason rules this out, these faces are just a natural landform that were there from the beginning, human created, or were made from a landing ship.",

There are such landforms like a mesa that the scientists think is what the face really is. People today still do not believe scientists that the so called face is just a landform. I think people should believe that its a natural landform, because scientists have improved their cameras, scientists know more on the topic then civilians do, and people assumed and over exaggerated too quickly.\n \n Scientists have improved there pictures since the Viking 1 took the photo. They have better quality and have done some more research. The aricle says that there cameras have improved and been upgraded. The scientists say that there are several options that the mound could be. Two options are a mesa and a butte.\n \n The people do not know as much as the scientists do. The scientists have done research and gone to school over this type of thing. They can identify it easily. In the article one said that the landfrom looks common to some in the American West. They compared it to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This shows that the people have less knowledge in this area then scientists do.\n \n People over exaggerated it when they first found out anyway. They weren't positive that it was what they thought it was. The aritcle stated that right away people made movies, stories, and articles about it. The picture shows on the Viking 1 that it was just shadows. The newer pictures were shown to not really show facial features. Yes people could see the figure of a face, but its outrageous to think that an alien formed such thing.\n \n These facts show that it is highly unlikely to have an alien form such thing. There is more proof that it is a natural landform. But would you want people getting all excited and happy because they THOUGHT an alien existed. Its also just a way to get children to believe foolish things and maybe even give them nightmares.",

I must say that the first picture in 1976 looks a lot like an alien, but we have gotten better technology and the newest pictures show it is just a monument. It resembles the butte or mesa landforms in the American West. They are naturally formed in nature. As my colleague said in his text they resemble eachother enormously. Also, we used the absolute maximum resolution in the latest picture we took in 2001. It was made very apparent that this was not aliens at work but again just a natural landform. The only reason that people aren't believing the truth with our technology is because these conspiracy theorists. Finally, the biggest piece of evidence that the face is a natural landform is that if NASA discovered this, we would benefit tremendously. We are not hiding this from anyone. We here at NASA would get more money, funding, and attention. We mainly would want the funding to perhaps interact with the aliens if they were there, but they are not. So that is why I, a scientist at NASA, can confirm that the picture from 1976 is just a bad picture of a natural landform. Also, I can confirm that we here at NASA aren't hiding the truth from you.

    essay: "The first time NASA first spotted the Face on Mars was in 1976 during the Viking 1 mission. At first the scientists back at NASA were surprised, but it did not last long. After some research was done scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. What made the mesa look like a face were just shadows. When the image was revealed to the public it got a lot of attention. Although some believed the face was a sign of alien life, others were not as easily convinced.\n \n The first picture was taken in 1976 when technology was not very great. So in 1997\n \n NASA 's Mars Exploration Program chief scientist, Jim Garvin decided he'd try to get another photo. On April 8, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the site again. Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture that was, \"Ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,\" the article says. But other conspiricy theorists think otherwise.\n \n The article mentions that the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. It was apparently winter there in April of '98. Skeptics say, \"Perhaps alien markings were hidden by the haze.\" Garvin says, \"Targeting Cydonia was not easy...in fact it is hard to work.\" Mars Global Surveyor noramally looks straight down but in order to get a good picture, they would have to actually move the camera 2.5 km. They also do not pass over the face very often.\n \n On April 8, 2001 they attempted another picture. This time the picture was perfect. It was a cloudless day in Cyndonia. \"The team had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view.\" Garvin said. Not easy work. The article also mentions that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photos. I think that this picture did really prove that the Face was only a landform and not some kind of martian marking.\n \n In the end people came to relize that the Face on Mars was really on a butte or a mesa of some sort. Garvin says, \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground...you could have seen what they were.\" I personally do not think the Face is part of ancient Martian life but as Garvin says, \"It reminds me of most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.\" I hope now that the others that once believed in the face now relize it really was only their imagination.",

    essay: "I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical. And, to prove my point, I have conjured a few reasons as to why this \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform.\n \n Firstly, the picture taken in 2001 is solid proof, as well as the 1998 picture. Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked.\n \n Also, I will point out that, in 1976, we at NASA were still relatively new to venturing beyond Earth's orbit. The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was.\n \n My final claim that the Face on Mars is a mesa lies in the fact that, if the Face really was an alien monument, NASA would not keep their lips tight about it. It would make global headlines, and shock the world. I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.\n \n Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens. Thank you for your time and effort in reading this essay.",

The picture of the Face on Mars was captured on May 21, 2001, and a few days later it was shown to the public which got this whole thing started. Most of the people from NASA believed that it was just a natural landform, but conspiracy theorists believed the it was created by aliens on Mars. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper to reveal a natural landform. It was just a huge rock formation which resembled a human face, and the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars because they would benefit off of it.\n \n A few days after the photo of the Face was snapped, they showed it to the public for everbody to see. The NASA team caption the photo with \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" Some people believe that the Face was created by aliens on Mars. NASA and many scientists believed that it was just another Martian Messa. Martian Messas were common enough around Cydonia.\n \n On April 5, 1998, The MOC team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. The photo first appeared on the JPL web site, and it revealed a natural land form. Since the Face was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, it was winter at the time they snapped the picture which was in April of 1998. At this time, it was cloudy on the planet Mars, so the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Conspiracy theorists said that maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.\n \n Lastly, the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was ancient civilization on Mars. If aliens did exist and NASA did discover them or signs of them, then NASA would benefit off of it. NASA would most likely send people or some kind of camera to take better pictures and videos of Mars. NASA would not keep it to themselves, they would share it with the public. After all this time survaying and taking pictures of Mars, they have not found alien life form on Mars.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform like many others. The Face just happens to be unique because of it's many shadows that make the Face resemble an actual face. Many rock formations happen on the planet of Mars. The Face is no different then the many thers of it's kind. The Face is the most unique and interesting landform found on Mars the is one of the many natural landforms presents on the planet Mars.",

After they found it few days later NSA said \"It's a huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head..formed by shadows gving illusion of eyes ,nose,and mouth.\" If your not a sceincetist it sounds more realistic. Right? Next I'm going to tell more facts that it was not an alien that create the human face on mars.\n \n When globa surveyor came in Sept. 1997 they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot of the face. Micheal Malin went to mars he took hs team and a camera that too ten times sharper than the orignal camera they took it with before. When they uploaded the picture all NSA found was landforms . Their is no such thing as aliens mountment. Some people were not impressed with this answer and cause it was located differntly in the winter time and alein maring might of been hidden by the haze. The MGS team even went out there again with a cloudless summer day and was 25 degrees in the center of the face and even used a different camera again and made it bigger and sharper. If there was any mountments or traces of aliens or space crafts you could obivously see it, but they did not find anything like that. NSA did find a lava dome that takes form of an isolated messa about the same height as the face on mars.\n \n There is not any life on mars after all not even aliens. It as just a natural landform that freaked some people to thinking their are aliens. But you can not agrue with a sceintifc fact thats been proven over and over again with differnt season and diiferent angles. The answer they kept getting back was a naturel landform.",

So many poepel had already heard about it and were giving out thier opinions. As I read through so many of them they all had great point and soem didn't even know what they were talking about. I really wannted to show the new worker that he was wrong. Then it hit many me, I knew what I had to do. I began to make my own page abot the face on Mars.

The first piese of evidence would be Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper then the original photos. The secouned piece of evidence i would use would be Malin's team captured a photo using the camera's maximum resolution. The third piece of evidence i would use would be the picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.\n \n The first piece of evidence, On April 5, 1998, The MArs Surveyor flew over the cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper then the original photos. What the photo revealed was a natural land formation not an alien monument.\n \n The secouned piece of evidence, MalinÂ’s team captured a photo using the cameraÂ’s maximum resolution. In the Viking photo the pixels were only 43 meters, But every pixel was 1.56 meters in the 2001 photo. That means in a image three times larger than the pixel size you would see objects such as airplans, pyramids or small shacks in the photo.\n \n Finally the third piece of evidence, The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which is a common land formation around the American West.\n \n Thouses are the three pieces of evidence i would use to support my claim and convince someone that the face is just a landformation.\n \n Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper then the original photos revealing a natural land formation.

In December at the North it snow's quit often. Which makes it very hard for a good picture.\n \n On a snow day have you every went outside and looked up. Well its very cloudy. Then your trying to tell me that it was a ancient alien civization. Theres no way we could get a clear picture of what it is on a snowy day. Between the camera distance from mars and the snowy day the only way you could prove that there is aliens their is by going to mars, which has never been done.\n \n The only reason you want this to be true is because NASA would get more moeny for the disoveration of the first ancient civization that we have found. Everyday there is new story lines of \"ancient civization\" saying they have found something like this, but in the end its just a solid rock with no life.\n \n In support snowy days equal blurry camera pictures. This picture is just showing piece of rock that was taken at the right angle at the right time to show a face.

    essay: "In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", there is information showing that the Face is a natural landform, and was not created by aliens. I have to agree, and say that the Face is a natural landform. Reasons to back up my thought would include, that the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures showing that it wasn't a real face, they have never seen anything like this before, and more scientists believed it was a rock formation rather than an alien.\n \n The Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures to get closer looks on the formation, to see if it could be a real face or not. In paragraph 7 it stated, \"...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" Malin and his team took sharper pictures to prove to other people that they were right about it being a natural landform. Scientists also haven't seen anything like this before. In paragraph 9 it mentioned, \"We just donÂ’t pass over the Face very often.\" If it really was an alien you would see more things like this because there wouldn't be just one alien, there would way more, causing there to be more faces. More scientists also believed that the Face was a natural landform, while only a few believed it could have been an alien feature. Within paragraph 8 it stated, \"But not everyone was satisfied... Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" By the article saying this, they showed that some people disagreed with the other scientists, and actually thought it was some sort of alien marking.\n \n Although, most of the scientists say that this is a natural landform, there will always be someone who wants to disagree with them. No matter how many people would say that something is right, there will always be that one person who has to be different then everyone else. In the article, there are more facts saying that the rock is a natural landform, even though that leading it to be bias. There would be a better argument, if you had one story saying it was natural, and one story saying it's because of an alien.",

    essay: "There are still some disputes about the true \"identity\" and origin of the Face on Mars. It is most likely just a natural landform, but some people disagree. Some people believe that it was created by aliens. However, since there is no legit proof of aliens even being real, how could you prove that they did this? NASA also has high-resolution photographs that make it pretty clear that it's just a natural landform. It may have taken several tries to collect all of the needed data to back this up, but the scientists did it so now we know.\n \n As I briefly mentioned before, there is no proof of alien life actually existing. So, then, why are people convinced that it was aliens? Yes, it may have a strange shape, but that doesn't mean anything. There are strange shaped things here on Earth but people don't accuse it of being alien. Now, I do understand that this is in space, and on a different planet, but still; there are way more logical explanations. It's normal for there to be landforms on planets. That's simply the deal here.\n \n The scientists also collected high-resolution photos of the Face. When the best photo was taken in 2001, it was made clear that this was just a landform, similar to some in the American West. It was just a formation that looked suspicious from far away. If you looked at the zoomed in picture, it just looks like a jumble of rocks. People just need to think realistically.\n \n There is, however, a couple small reasons why people see a possibility of this being done by aliens. One of the pictures was taken from behind a small wispy cloud. This gave some people enough reason to believe that there could be alien markings hidden by the haze. Another reason people have for believing this is extraterrestrial work is that there have been some unexplainable sightings and findings that may point to alien life existing. There is no actual facts or proof, but enough has happened without logical explanations to convince certain people of this theory.\n \n I respectfully refute these points. The idea of alien markings being hidden is a stretch. There was an even clear picture taken more recently that showed no alien markings. It proved that it was just a landform. There's really not that much more to it. In response to the few unexplainable things that may point to alien life, we have no way to tell what's really out there. If there is something, then it's doing a pretty good job of staying hidden, or undiscovered because we have no cold, hard proof of anything. For some things there are just no logical answers. There's always going to be something we don't know. It's probably the most reasonable to just stick to the facts we already have, and learn to accept the most likely stories. Yes, it's okay to believe or hope that there is something out there, but people should also realize that they need to think reasonably in certain matters, especially when there's proof, like in this case.\n \n This is a very strong argument. There are many ways that a person could keep going on and on, explaining each detail to its full extent, but I think all the most important information has already been mentioned. People should accept the facts. There is always going to be someone who disagrees, but every argument is like that. There is way more proof pointing to the conclusion that the Face is just a landform. You might still think something different, but I think I've made it clear why I have so much reason to believe what I believe.",

    essay: "Twenty five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting mars looking for possible landings sights for Viking 2 it spotted a \"face\" on mars in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. NASA revealed the images of this \"face\" thinking that it would be a good way to attract attention to mars. It worked too, maybe not in the way NASA had hoped though. This \"face\" caused many people to belive that it was proof that there is or was life on Mars.\n \n NASA explains this \"face\" formation on Mars as a Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â” Many skeptics believe that this \"face\" is proof of life forms on Mars and that NASA is just trying to cover it up. Although if this was proof of life forms on Mars then that would greatly benefit NASA so why would they try and cover it up? Well the answer is they wouldnt. If there was any proof that there was life forms on Mars then NASA would benefit greatly and they would most likely reveal that to the public as well, not hide it.\n \n So what is this \"Face of mars\" that has had so many people questioning NASA and skepticizing over whether or not there is life on Mars? Well, the latest picture was an MGS image from 2001. This image shows the \"Face\" for what it actually is, which is a mesa. As it says in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West.\" Â“ThatÂ’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.Â”\n \n This lattest image has been able to show us what the rock land form on Mars actually is. Which is just a mesa. Slowly since the image from the NASA Viking 1 in 1976 we have been getting better and better quality images. With these better quality images we are able to see that this rock land form on Mars doesnt even really look like a face. Slowly the pictures have gotten less hazy and we have been able to better see the \"face.\"\n \n When you look back on that first image, the one from the Viking 1space ship in 1976 its easy to say that the land from on Mars looks like a face. Because it does look like a face in that first bad quality image, but now that we have new technology with better photo taking abilities it is easy to see that what we once may have thought looked like a face. Is just a mesa on Mars. Not proof that there is aliens, or other life forms on Mars. Just a Mesa, that in all reality doesnt actually look all that much like a face.",

    essay: "The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. Through advancements in digital imagery, an understanding of shadows, and an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, it can be concluded that the face on mars is just a myth.\n \n Today, we humans have the access to cameras with spectacular resolution. When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.\n \n Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This excerpt from the article explains that the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.\n \n While many conspiracy theorists would still like to believe that aliens created this face on the moon, they are mistaken. With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found. However, others still argue.\n \n Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms. The article mentions, \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars.\" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information.\n \n So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.",

We found out the picture was takin in winter on the planet and it was a cloudy day.\n \n But it has to be alein life form that created this. They can easely destroy what they make. us humans do it all the time. And why would you guys at NASA put something like this out in the world for people to see? If it wasnt real life on anouther planet. Do you like playing games with us.\n \n So we also know that there is no life on mars because we have cameras that can capture the smallest of sheds. On camera so if we saw a little house on the camera we would think there is life on this plante for sure(11). at NASA we didnt know exactly what caused that face at the time.

First, Martian mesas were common. They were very common around Cydonia as said in the article. Second, it did look like a face.

The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" Since people believe whatever they see on the interent, they had to of jumped to conclusions and people had to of been throwing out the idea of \"Oh! that has got to be made by an alien!\" so that's what people starting saying. The NASA reveiled th photo hoping it would bring attention to Mars, but that is sure what they got. But it was the atention that an alien had made the landform.\n \n So, with that being said, MOC had actual camera photage of the landform, NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get accurate pictures, and people over the internet were just trying to make it seem like an alien was real. That proves that the face was just a natural landform.",

    essay: "So you say the discovery of the face Cydonia that was founded in Mars back in 1976 was created by aliens. I seem to disagree with your argument. As we have done more research here in NASA back in 2001 each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 image which means with the new and more improved technology we got a closer and better resolution of the face Cydonia on Mars which you so think was created by aliens. The recent image of Cydonia from 2001 has better pixel quality so that we can zoom in more to see if there are any other objects other than Cydonia such as cars or houses in which we both know don't exist in the red planet. Cydonia has unusual shadows that make it resemble a human head with it giving us an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalent of a butte Mesa which are also landforms that are commonly found in the American West. So as you know that after the discovery, photographing Cydonia has became one of our main priority for us here at NASA to prove that it wasn't created by aliens. I hope that after you heard my side of the argument you have a different view of Cydonia as it formed by itself in the red planet.",

    essay: "While most people believe the \"Face\" on mars was just a natural landform there are also people who believe it was created by aliens. Those people believed it was an alien artifact that was seen in the photograph taken above Mars by Viking 1 during 1946. But there are many peices of evidence that support the idea of the \"Face\" just being a natural landform.\n \n For starters, when the \"Face\" was first seen on Cydonia, Mars, it was photographed by Viking 1 on 1976, which during that time cameras weren't as powerful as cameras now so the picture quality back in 1976 was blurry compared to today's photos. The '' Face\" was actually just a Martian mesa which is a lava dome, which are common in Cydonia. Soon after, scientists concluded \" it was a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" And if the \"Face was actually created by aliens NASA wouldn't have told the public since it could've caused public panic, but instead NASA used the ''Face\" as a way to attract the public's attention towards Mars. So in the end, the \"Face\" did bring much attention to Mars which was NASA's intention.\n \n While conspiracy theorists believe the \"Face\" was real evidence of life on Mars, it was actually not, defenders of the NASA budget confirmed it when they said that they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Even when few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA. So on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Then, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a picture which was ten times sharper rhan the original Viking photos. And so, the Face was confimed by Micheal Malin and his Orbiter Cameria (MOC) team to just be a natural landform.\n \n But still again people were not content since the Face on Mars was located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998, which was a cloudy day. And so, the camera in the MGS had to take a photograph though clouds to see the Face which skepics still said \"alien markings were hidden by the haze.\" So once more, on April 8, 2001, which was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the MGS or the Mars Global Sirveyor grew closer until it was 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. The 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\n \n In conclusion, the photo taken on 2001, finally confirmed that the Face on Mars was really a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. So in the end, the Face was never created by aliens but it was just a natural landform.",

    essay: "Have you heard of \"The Face On Mars\"? If not then listen closely, the face is'nt real. It's just a Mesa that looked like a face back in 1976 cause of the technology back then. With today's technology we are able to see that it's just another landform on Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars was a great mystery and a degree of surprise back in 1976 since they were just exploring mars at the time and didn't really know what to expect from it when they found that landform. Since then the Face became a pop icon and stared in multiple Hollywood films, magazines, and books. Because of the landform on Mars people thought that is was solide evience that life was on mars or that there was life on Mars. Thus aftward scienctists tried to take another picture of Cydonia (The Face) with the improved technology and show that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a landform on Mars.\n \n In the image it did look more like a landform yet it still resembled a face so conspiarators still beleived that there was still life on mars or that there was life on Mars. The people that weren't saticfied said that The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April of 1998 which is a cloudy time on Mars. Thus the people also beleived that there could be alien markings but were hidden by the wispy clouds that the MGS couldn't see through.\n \n Life on Mars is possible and the Face could be real and could have markings on it but because of the cloudy day the MGS couldn't see the Face clearly.\n \n On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day had come and it was time to take a picture of the Face. The photo was taken with maximum resolution, and when people saw the picture there was no mistaking it for a landform on Mars. Garvin also added \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" said Gravin. So the Mar's Face was just a landform on Mars that looked like a face because of the technology back in 1976 and because of the cloudy day when NASA took the second picture of The Face.",

NASA has taking picuters of the figure that look like alien artifacts. They were just regular wierd shaped objects .\n \n In 2001, the pictures that was taking on the planet showed nothing. Later on in reseach,we discovered that the research on the Martian figures sought out to be fake. I described everything we found on the photos that was taking. \"I have seen those photos and they are not true. The basic studies say they were a consparicy and were hidden because they were not sought to be real shot photos of the forming figures. \" If you look closely at the phots took in 2001 one you shall she the photo shows nothing but land and a ight platform of the planet\" I said to show a better undersatding of ehat the photo shows.\n \n \" I have done research on this for years and only seen photos of the moving figures of a Martian moving on Cydonia.\" \" We have seen photos or illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth in the resonable photos I have seen.\" \" This photo shows how the ancient civilization of these forming aliens are real.\" These forms are basic facts and sought to be true.\n \n Those photos show and just make the picutre seem like it is forming real life aliens, but that is just how the photo was shot. Continuosly, NASA has changed the way they shot the photos. The photo that was taking before was not taking carefully. The others that was taking was by a more advanced shot. Then it was stated to be no alien monument at all. It was just a natural platform of the planet.\n \n This was just a basic statement to show how the alien photos shot by Viking was just not like it was in 2001. Were the phots true? Did the Face On Mars really affect the live of what lives outside of us? Well we know that it really was a natural platform.",

    essay: "Hello, I am a scientist from NASA I am here to tell you that the Face, found on Mars, was not created by aliens, the face is just a natural landform. We have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from the NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is. The Face is just a mesa created by natural landforms. I am sorry to tell you but aliens do not exist, we haven't found any evidence proving that aliens exist.\n \n Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet Mars taking some pictures of the possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking. While it was taking the pictures for the possible landing sites, something funny had happened, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face on the plant. It turned out to be an enormous head nearly two miles form end to end. No this was not created by aliens. Us scientist have been working as hard as we can to see how this \"Face\" was created. We haven't found anything about it being created by aliens. The Face is just a natural landform. Us scientist at NASA figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n A few days later us at NASA released the image to the public to see. The title of the image was \"huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head ... formed by shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" A few of us scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact, but it was talked about with the scientist of NASA and we decided that it wasn't created by aliens because there is no sign of life on Mars that we have found. On April 5, 1998, is when a Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera, also known as (MOC), team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The pictures revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no proof that it was created by aliens. Aliens do not exist they are just made up and scientists, like me, at NASA have never found evidence about aliens existing.\n \n Not everyone was satified with the picture. Everyone thought that the weather conditions were different because the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. Since it was winter in April '98, it was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board, MGS, had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face, so people thought that the photo that was taken was not a fair photo. The people wanted a fair photo that they could see in almost the same weather condtions. We gave people what they want and we went to look for it again. Mission controllers prepared to look again but it was not easy. The face is very hard to track and get a picture of. The Mars Global Surveyor on Apil 8, 2001, went to take another picture, and it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The spacecraft had to be 25 degrees to center the Face. Each pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel, but when it was compared to he 2001 image it spans 1.56 meters. The picture was easier to look at and they got a closer view. They came to the conclusion of it just being a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the image from NASA, known as the Face, was not created by aliens. The image is just a natural landform. According to scientist, like me, at NASA there was no proof that the Face was not created by aliens. Thanks to the technology that we have it is very clear that the image is just a natural landform that created itself.",

While other say it is a natural rock formation. I am here to tell you that it is a nautral rock formation, by picture and other edivence.\n \n The first pieace of edivence are the picture that were taken by Viking 1 and MGS, Mars Global Survey. In 1976 it looks like a face, but we didn't have the technology that we have. The first picture was 43 meters per pixel, which is a lot. Now if this technology advance we now get 1.56 meters per pixel, so if the face on Mars was really set up by aliens we would see their huts or anything else they built. The second piece of edivence is shadows, as you can see in the pictures it is just how the sun is position and how the statlite is postion to make it look like a face. The last reason is other natural sites that have the same size and looks like the face on Mars. The face on Mars reminds the Auroth of a place in Idaho. It is a Butte in the Snake river Plain. It is almost the same size and shape.\n \n In conclusion the face of Mars is a natural site, and not made by aliens. I know because of the picture of the face of Mars.

Here are my reasons why.\n \n The Face on Mars is real because it can be a natural landform on Mars just like we have natural landforms on Earth. Now may I ask a question? How can ailens make a face on Mars? In the picture provided, it seems the face pops out and there is no evidence that a creature could have made a face with no flaws. In the article, a webiste states \" thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.\"\n \n I understand that people may have a theory about the face, but hence the word theory. Theory is just a guess with evidence supporting the claim, but is there enough evidence to support the Face? People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape.\n \n How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face. The face could have been on Mars since Mars was created and NASA just never payed enough attention until 1976. I do not believe an ailen created the Face on mars.\n \n Is the face on Mars real? Keep that question in your head. I believe this essay has provided enough evidence proving the Fac on Mars is just a natural landform. That's just my opinion. What's your opinion?",

Nasa a billion dollar company dissagrees and has proof that this is indeed a landmark with a shadow and not any sort of alien life. That has not stopped some conspiracy theorists from saying that this is a cover up.\n \n Nasa as we all know is a company that is paid to fly unmanned and sometimes manned aircraft into the sky and most excitingly space. That is a positive thing for us humans who have no idea why we are here and how are we here. People don't like to know or believe the truth and sometimes make up lies or takes something the wrong way and make everyone from the news to the everyday household hear about something that didn't even turn out to be true. That is the same case here, Nasa released a photo of a mountain during a time of day that would have shadows, and Nasa being a public and government company is forced by law to release photos to the people. Which leads to more proof if Nasa took more photos that showed aliens or other inteligent lifeforms they would have to release it they can't just magicly hit erase.\n \n Conspiracy theorist still do not believe Nasa so they demand more photos and still Nasa has even more proof that this \"face'' is indeed a montain with shadows stratigicly placed to look like a human face. Theorist say that everything Nasa does is either faked or fixed to look like something it is not. In this case it went viral and many people still believe it was aliens that went there and did that but Nasa declines and this time Nasa has a little more proof.\n \n Nasa would've got money to send a human or a robot to Cydonia if it were a human lifeform or an alien, and we all know the team that worked on it would've got some pretty heavy paychecks just by working on the case, just imagine that checks the team would make if it were a civilivation. But Nasa will not be sending over humans or a robot for a couple reasons, the best reason is that the already know that this is just a mountain, not a civiliation.\n \n In conclusion Nasa knows this is a mountain and not a lifeform of any kind.\n \n Nasa also knows that lifeforms like ours can not survive on the surface of any planet without an atmousphere like mars. So even if a lifeform can survive without oxygen unlike us that the proof of that area says otherwise.",

NASA has realeased information about the Face, but speculators think NASA is hiding something from them which is called bona fide. Since the very first trip to Cydonia, many people have been intreaged by the topic. As said in paragrapgh 5 , \"The Face has become a pop icon\". The idea that a face was on Cydonia made people think that there had to be a creator. The creators were aliens. The next time the Mars Orbiter Camera went to Cydonia, NASA claimed there were clouds blocking the veiw of the Face. This must have shown that NASA was hiding something. NASA also tried to say that they don't pass over the Face that often. Maybe NASA didn't people to find things out. All these peices of evidence put together must prove that aliens created the Face on Cydonia.\n \n Scientist from NASA can help prove the speculators wrong. Speculators assume that the Face couldn't have just been created over time. In paragrapgh 12, it states that there are similar landforms created, called mesa, in America. Next, the speculators say that there were clouds blocking the veiw of alien clues during the Orbit Camera journey. Since the clouds blocked the veiw of the planet, NASA sent another camera on clear day. In paragrapgh 10 and 11 it says the camera took the absolute maximum resolution.

    essay: "Have you ever seen or ever been on Mars? Most of you might have not, but studying Mars is a part of my job. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.\n \n My first reason is because aliens do not exist. There has been much research in this world to prove that aliens do not exist, but still some people believe that there are aliens. Whenever something weird happens in space, we always have to say aliens exist, and there is a lot of proof that they don't. On Mars, landforms can change, just like any other planet. For example, in 1976 it started out by looking like a bump. Then in 2001, it warped into many different shapes with cracks or ridges in it, and in the end it turned out looking like a face.\n \n My second reason is because NASA has proved that it is a natural landform. It says in paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they recieved the photo it revealed a natural landform. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. So, the Face was proved to be a natural landform in the end.\n \n My third reason is because the Face looks like landforms on Earth. In paragraph 12 it states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the Americian West.\" This tells us that the Face is common and not a shockingly new landform. Also, in paragraph 12 it says, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" So, the Face is obviously not a new thing, because Earth has a landform very similar to it. Landforms are made naturally and it takes many years to start noticing the changes in a landform.\n \n Some people might say that aliens are real and that over the years they have been working on this landform. They could also say that NASA rarely goes over the Face because it is so hard to find, so NASA never sees the aliens because of this reason. This is all true, except that aliens are real; there is no true proof of knowing if aliens are real or not, but they most likely aren't. Also, NASA has proved that the Face isn't a new landform, but that it is similar to many landforms on Earth.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.",

The text even states, \"\"It reminds me most ofMiddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\"\" Not only that but it mentions, \"\"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the face on mars.\"\"\n \n Why not ask questions about landforms that look detailed or look like aliens may have done it on earth?\n \n The main reason the face looked the way that it did was because of the shadows that it casted. The text tells us, \"Shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" The text also tells us, \"Because of its face like structure it become a great attraction. Starring in films, books, magazines and other articles.\" If it weren't for the shaddows then what was the point.\n \n What if NASA is lying? What if none of this is true? WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BELIEVE US? People should believe NASA because again this all would benefit NASA. The text even states, \"Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars.\" Not to mention, if it was a sign of human life it would show a dramatic increase of popularity.\n \n So no it isn't an alien statue, or a sign of ancient alien civilization. If it was we would tell you so we could have a benefit or major profit. On Earth we have natural landforms all around that look like actual things made by aliens. Why not question them about those natural landforms? Not only that, the only real reason it looked like a face was because the shadows it casted made it look like it had a mouth, eyes, nose, and other facial features. And we're not lying because it would benefit us.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars is really just a big mistunderstanding. I strongly say that because there so many reasons what this could be. The text says only a few scientists thinks the Face is an alien artifact, I could see if there was atleast half but theres only few. There is nothing really that proves that its an alien artifact, therefore I would say believe that its just a natrual landform.\n \n In the text it says that when they took the picture it was winter. That means its a cloudy time for Mars. So the clouds could b messing it up and making it appear as a face. Even on Earth if we look at a cloud it can make the shape of a face or anything. The article also states that the Face on Mars is about the same height of a lava dome. Which means this could be a lava dome mixed with a cloud and that cause it to look like a face.\n \n So we would never know intil someone physically go and see it for themself. So I strongly believe that this is just a big mistunderstanding.",

    essay: "Many people believe that this face on Mars was made by an Ancient Alian Race that once lived on Mars. This Face was discivered 25 Years ago on a space Expedition. Most NASA scientisis believe that this Face on Mars is a natural land form but, some believe that it is not natural and was formed by Alians. Many Scientists also think against the thought of the formation on Mars being made by an ancient civilization that lived on Mars. Scientists that are against the theory of the face being formed by Alians argue that there are formations on Earth that are also formed how the one on Mars was and that this is natural.\n \n Many Scientisis believe that this is a natural landform because it is like some of the other landforms in the Western United States like the Butte in the Snake River Plain of Ohio. Scientists believe that both of these landforms were created by lava domes because the two formations are around the exact same height and are therefore believed to be created in the same and natural way.\n \n Scientisis have been researching the Face on Mars for years abd have come up with a reasonal explination for why the Face on Mars was not created by Alians and is a natural land formation that is created the same way as some formations in the Western United States. Though Scientists would like to have proof that there was a race of martians that lived thousands of years ago there is logical information prooving that this was a natural formation that is also experienced on Western Regions of the United States.",

    essay: "This object on Mars has been theorized to be a face, but there is no way this could represent life on Mars. There are many pictures of Mars and nothing else showed that there could be life. There are many reasons why this is not a factor that shows that there is life on Mars. There is not enough resources, it was shown to be a natural landform after better technology was used, and it is similar to the Middle Butte in Idaho as mentioned in the article.\n \n My first reason, is that there is not enough resources to be able to have life on Mars. There is barely any water except for ice on Mars. There are no plants to create oxygen. There have been no signs of any thing to provide life other than the frozen water as previously mentioned. Most of all Mars is too cold to be able to have life on it. The only way for something to live on Mars is if something somehow adapted to that type of enviroment.\n \n Another reason, is that it was shown to be a mesa type lanform. The first picture was similar to a face because technology was not advanced enough to take a clearer picture. After we made better technology we were able to get a better and clearer picture that shows it was just a landform.\n \n My third and final reason, is that it is very similar to landforms on our planet. We have mesas amd buttes all over our planet. The one that is most similar is in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Many pictures shown that the \"face on Mars\" is not real.\n \n All of these reasons show that there is no way that this is a sign of life on Mars. As I mentioned there is not enough resources, it was shown to be a landform, and that it is similar to landforms here on Earth. So there is no way that this is a sign of another form of life other than the life on our planet.",

In 1998 they took another photo of the \"Face of Mars\" they had a beter camera with more pixels in it. This photo still does look like a face but you can also kinda see it starting took look like a mountain. Then the last photo that was taken of the \"Face of Mars\" was in 2001 and you can obviosly see that the so called face is just rock formation. The authore put this quote of someone from nasasay this Â“As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,Â” he added.

    essay: "Ever since humans have discovered space and the existence of other planets, the belief that we are not alone in the universe has been a back-and-forth question over the years. It has inspired many works and become a huge part of pop culture. While this can be fun to think about, sometimes people who can't accept the truth take it too far. The Face on Mars is just a natural landfrom because technology wasn't that good in 1976, people (especially conspiracy theorists) take can take things like this too far, and the formation is just like others on Mars and even on Earth.\n \n The original photo of the Face on Mars was taken way back in 1976 by NASA's Viking 1. The spacecraft was only trying to find landing spots for another NASA ship, Viking 2, when the picture was snapped. Technology has evolved vastly over the past few decades, but 1976 was right at the start of this kind of space exploration technology, with the moon landing only happening 7 years prior to this event. When the latest photo of the face was snapped in 2001, its resolution was 10 times sharper than the Viking 1's photo. It showed every crack and bump on the surface of the \"face\", while the Viking's only showed patches of white while most of it was covered in shadow. Even a Mars Global surveyor photo from 1998 (which was taken with better technology than the Viking 1's) revealed a mesa formation. The photos taken after the original in 1976 definitely show anything but a face, which shows that the Face on Mars was only seen because of developing technology at the time.\n \n Everytime there is a statement made by an organized group like NASA, or a government of any kind, people like to try to disprove these statements and say that they are fake. These people are called conspiracy theorists. They usually jump to conclusions on statements like this all the time with little or no evdidence. Back in the 1960s and '70s, the space race had started, causing many people to believe that we are not alone in this universe of ours. Anytime there was a trace of alien life out there, radios would broadcast about it, new channels would cover it, and sometimes even movies were made about these, just like in the case of the Face on Mars. Since these are people's main sources for news, they believed the claims instantly. When NASA revealed a picture of a supposed 'face on mars', the population went crazy. This was solid proof of ancient alien life on another planet, the conspiratists believed, but alas, the only reason this face appeared was due to technology with not enough resolution to snap a high quality picture of the formation. Conspiratists claimed that alien life on Mars would be something that NASA would \"want to hide\", but in response to this, defenders of the NASA budget said that \"they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars\". If the face was actually alien, NASA never would have come out and told the public of its existence, or at least would've said that it was alien in its reveal. Instead that caption read; \"A huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head...\" This shows that NASA directly knew that the formation was natural and most definitely not alien.\n \n The Face on Mars was quite the phenomenon, which started out the belief that there was alien life out in space and also on the planets near to Earth. When scientists first saw the formation from the Viking 1, they were suprised to see a face on the screen, but that was only at first. Scientists quickly realized that the face was nothing more than a Martian Mesa. These mesas are very common around Cydonia (the region of Mars in which the photo was taken). These formations are also on other parts of Mars and even here on Earth. Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated, \"It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River of Idaho.\" This shows that a formation like a mesa is super easy to indentify, and one on Mars could just as easily be identified with good enough technology, as proven by the Mars Global Survey spacecraft and the Mars global surveyor from 1998, which was even taken through clouds on the red planet. It makes sense for the formation to be a mesa, especially since the fact that there were no other facelike structures like this found on Mars since.\n \n The Face on Mars is a natural landform because the technolgy that took the photo wasn't that great compared to years after, conspiracy theorists can really blow things like this in the worng direction, and the formation of the face resembles structures like that on Mars and Earth. With our knowledge and exploration of space growing every day, it is just a matter of time until we discover alien life somewhere. The problem is, people can get so caught up in these kind of things and overexagerate them to beyond reasoning. Technology has advanced so much in the past few years, so much that we can see every crack and divit on the surface of a planet, so the question is, when will we actually discover a real \"Face on Mars\"?",

They have taken 3 pictures and 2 of them prove it is a mesa on Mars. The proof of that is that they have taken pictures in 1998,2001, and have compared it to a landform in the USA. People who believe it is created by aliens suely hasn't seen all the evidence behind \"The Face.\"\n \n First of all, when people saw the face in 1976 they couldnt have had o believe an aliens as making it. How could have there have been a person on Cydonia or an alien. That is why they went back to Mars to prove some scientists' theories wrong. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor had flew over Cydonia for the first time. The surveyor had a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Some people were not satisfied because it was cloudy on the Red Planet. They said that the alien marking were hidden by blaze. Compaing the picture of 1998, it certailey looks more like a regular rock on a surface. They went back four years later on a less cloudy day to still prove the believers wrong.\n \n On a cloudless day the Mars Global Surveyor took away a piece of evidence of aliens in space. On April 8, 2001, four years later than the last visit to Cydonia, the surveyor captured the photo much better than all pictures and proved tha the face was a natural platform. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in he best 1976 Viking photo. The photos were astonishing and made the face be un masked.\n \n Jim Garvin, a chief scientist, said that \"It reminds me most pf Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the ame height as the Face on Mars.\" They are comaparing it to landforms on Earth!

    essay: "Scientists have been trying to figure out what the face is on Mars. It turns out that the face, is not really a face. Scientists discovered that the formation that everyone is seeing in the photograph is actually a landform called a Butte, they are most likely found in the American west.\n \n This formation was so astonishing that it was featured in a Hollywood film, Magazines, Books, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. People thought that this kind of evidence should be hidden. A few scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact, but phototgraphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. MGS is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine. Eighteen years later they decided to end the mission, they felt that it was important to taxpayers.\n \n On April 5, 1998, MGS flew across Cydonia for the first time. A team of Mars Orbiters took a picture ten time sharper than the original photo. An enormouse amount of web surfers waited for the pricture, but when it posted they weren't so satisfied. There wasn't and alien monument after all. NASA just does not pass over the face very often.\n \n On April 8, 2001, MGS drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in field of view. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa, which again are landforms common around the american West. It reminds people of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\n \n Each of the pictures pixles in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters compareed to 43 meters per pixle in the best 1972 image. If there were to be objects in the pictuer such as a plain on the ground or Eqyptian style Pyramids you would see them.

I believe that the Face is not a Martian creation because if NASA knew about it, they would tell people so that they would get more publicity and make more money.\n \n Also, after a higher resolution picture was taken of the face, it was clear that there was no sign of equipment near the face to build it. Lastly, Jim Garvin, who is a Mars expert, said, after long research, that the Face is just a landform.\n \n The first reason people should be able to tell that the Face is not a Martian creation is that NASA would tell people about the chance of Alien life on Mars. That fantasy has been around for hundreds of years! Books and movies have stories of Aliens from Mars. There would be many more sales for NASA. Therefore, it is obvious that NASA would tell the public if there really was a chance of Martian excistence.\n \n On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a photograph of the Head that was tens times sharperthan the first picture taken by the Viking. Many anxious web surfers where waiting for the image to appear on the JPL web site. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no sign of aliens at all.

Therefore there is no possoble way of a human or Martian building the Face.\n \n So, the many people in the world that believe that the Face on Mars is actually a creation of living beings, they are proven wrong. Multiple reasons point to the Face just being a landform that just so happens to be in the shape of a face. Not only would it take forever to make a face that is two miles long, it would also take supplies - which were not found. Furthermore, the Face on Mars is not a Martian creation.",

The shadows gave an illusion of eyes, a nose, and also a mouth.\n \n Another example, would be the pictures that the scientists have taken. The first picture that was taken was taken on a cloudy day. The picture was to blurry to be able to make out any details. In 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took another picture that was ten times sharper than the first. One of the cameras they had contributed greatly to the search, since that camera was so sharp they would have easily been able to find any markings from extraterrestrial beings.\n \n Also another detail helping the scientists was the weather. The weather took a massive part in this study. Since it wasn't a clear day at all and there were \"wispy clouds\", like in paragragh eight, the MOC team could not get a clear picture. When the team comes back to take yet another picture it is a clear day and with that clear day they are able to pick out any details from the \"artifact\" if there are any to pick out.\n \n A final example, is how they compared the face to a formation on Earth. The scientists compared the face to the Snake River Plain of Idaho because of how similar they are. They are similar in a way because of the isolated messa, height, and landforms.\n \n Theorists are saying the exact oppsoite from the researchers. Here is an example fo why they thought it was a true artifact. A few scientists themselves thought that is wasn't just a landform but something more. Since the scientists believed many people instantly believed too. They didn't think about the research that was done, but they chose to believe the few scientists.\n \n An example that would support the idea of them believing, is that there were many movies made about the face. Many people believe everything they hear and what they see on T.V.\n \n A final example is, how the skeptics thought it was created. \"If the aliens didn't create it then how did it form?\" That question was most likely going through their mind, trying to figure out if they should believe science and research or they should believe movies and others.\n \n Yes, i understand how skeptics actually believe that the face was made by aliens because they dont know how it was created. They don't know who created it either. Scientists are proving that it was weather that created the formation and maybe even astroides. Theorists may also thinking that the haze prevented the scientists from seeing the alien's markings. If weather and haze prevented that then why didn't the scienists see the markings on the next photo that they took. That photo was even ten times shaprer.\n \n The examples I have lsited help inform you why there is an argument going on about the face. Science clears and explains a lot more phenonmon than opinions and belifes do.",

    essay: "It was actually quite simple to see that it was not created by aliens. If you look at the pictures, it acts as if it was like any other landform on earth. As humans, our mind is very good at creating a false idea because we want it to be it is that way. However, it is clearly shown that the faces were not created by aliens.\n \n In the pictures shown in the article, the face changes as any fossil or landmark would on Earth. The jump from 1976 to 2001 is a big chance of what it would look like if it were on Earth. As said in the article, the JPL web site says it was a natural landform, not an alien monument. The only reason that the rumors of alien monuments still exsisted is because there were people who were still not satisfied.\n \n Another reason that the alien monument rumors were false is because even with a cloudless day in Cydonia, it still appeared as a natural landform. Granted, the rumors of clouds blocking the actual image of the face was a logical argument. However, they even took pictures on a cloudless day, and it still appeard as a natural landform.\n \n The theory that this was an alien civilization is totally inacurate. The pictures clearly show the actions of the face. Just because our imagination can create false ideas of life on another plannet, the evidence shows that acts and looks as a natural landform.",

It doesn't prove any aliens are on mars because it is another martian mesa with really good shadow placement to fool the eye.

That is one of the reasons why I think it is a coincedent.\n \n Even though NASA seems like they want to cover it they really don't want to because it will be the biggest find ever in space age history. We send probes and rovers for research and to find life. We also send then to find the necessary elements for life to exist. If we do find life it will be the biggest news for a long time. So we really aren't trying to hide anything exspecially aboutr life on mars.\n \n So if there was life on mars and they did make it ,why aren't there any other structures built. Like on earth aztecs did die out but had way more monuments to their gods. They didn't spend all their time building a face Plus their buildings couldn't erode away or the face would't be there. So why did they only build one ?\n \n Those are the reasons I believe face on mars is just coincedental. We really would want to find something on mars.

    essay: "This is\n \n Dianee and she is going to eplain to you why the \"face\" was not created by aliens. It all started in 1976 when Viking 1 took a photo of the \"face\". The face was located in Cydonia it is two miles long from end to end. It looked like a face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. It is actually a mesa. Then,in 1998 the MOC wanted to take another picture because many people were saying that it was created by aliens. This picture would be in movies,books,magazines,radio talk shows and even in grocery stores for twenty five years.\n \n When NASA let the public see this picture they believed it was created by aliens. We went back in 1998 and took some more pictures and it had still looked like a face but it was not. My people said that we (NASA) would rather hide then say that there was life on Mars, many conspiracy theorists were saying. We wouldn't hide we would tell the public so that we could get more money to be able to go to Mars and see these aliens.\n \n What some people wanted was aliens and other people didn't. Mostly all the scientists at NASA including myself did not believe that the\"face\" was created by aliens. So in 2001 we went again to Mars to get a picture of the \"face\". It would be a clearer picture because the cameras were ten times better than the cameras in 1976 and in 1998. It was very hard to get to that exact spot on Mars. The face on Mars was 41 degrees north martian latitude. On April 8,2001 it was summer in Cydonia when we had taken the picture in 1998 it was winter and it was very cloudy. The camera was 1.56 meters per pixel in 1976 it was 43 meters per pixel.\n \n So if there was objects on Mars like a plane of a pyramid we would know because we would be able to see it. We said that it was either a butte or a mesa. They are commom in the American West. It's kinda like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. They are basically lava domes but the one on Mars had looked like a face becasuse of the shadows. So,in conclusion the \"face\" is not created by aliens based on these facts.",

    essay: "Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? It's almost like a science-fiction novel. This mesa found on Mars has theories going in two directions. Was it created by aliens, or is it a natural landform? Both are possible, but only one is probable. The media can lead you to believe information that might not be true. Like in this situation, the \"Face on Mars\" that is said to be bona fide evidence of alien life, but it is proven to be just a natural landform.\n \n Forty years ago, when the \"face\" was first revealed, it seemed very likely that it was not made by nature. The search for alien life and all the money put into NASA's programs made people believe what they wanted to hear. As time went on, and new technology was put into effect, the images of the mesa became clearer. In the early 2000's, it was made clear that the mysterious \"face\" was just an illusion. One can tell from the images of the \"Face on Mars\" that the mesa can appear to look like a face when out of focus. Alien life on Mars has not been proven either, so without evidence of life, we can't assume that the \"face\" was not created by nature.\n \n It is possible that the mesa appeared as a face because of the dept perception and shadows. In reality, the landform barely looks like a face at all. In the most recent photo, the small details on the mesa almost look like the rivers we have here on Earth. The mesa is even compared to landforms that are found on Earth, as stated in the article. Since there is no proof of the \"face\" being alien-made, the only conclusion left is that it is a natural landform.",

    essay: "All scientists at NASA know that the \"The Face\" is a natural landform known as a mesa. But some people think that Nasa is lying to the public about it being a natural landform. I'm here today to argue that Nasa is indeed not lying.\n \n My first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying is that a drone was up in space taking pictures of it close enough to show the world tha it was just a natural landform. Viking 1 is the name of the spacecraft that took this photo and some mission controllers were suprised to see a face popu up on their screen. The chief scientist for NASA'S Mars exploration program said \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it .\"\n \n They also got more icture to deduce that it was actually instead of a face it was a natural landform. Thats my first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying.\n \n My second reason for knowing NASA is not lying is because the landform is called a mesa. Mesa's are more commonly found in the American West. So by thinking hardly about this it comes to mind could people that dont believe, could possibly being saying that this mesa isnt a mesa but something NASA is trying to cover up? But then the question comes to be WHY would Nasa be trying to hide some of this information from the public? Well it comes down to the simple fact they arent trying to hide anything from the public about the face they are giving us the true information and some people just dont thig thats the real actual truth.\n \n My thrid reason for knowing that Nasa is not lying they made the pictures into digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so if anything was on the surface such as a shack you could tell what it was. They do that so if they see anything that is a undertiminable object you can clerly tell what it is. The pixels arent as good as they could be today but they had a pretty lea view of what it is. they have the best cutting edge technology and are way more advanced than the open world is today so its highly unlikely that their system wasnt processing right. thats the end of my thrid reason.\n \n So some people believe that the face is actually just a natural landform but some people such as conspiracy theorists dont. I say that the conspiracy theorists have a point on why Nasa could be lying to the public. They probably think this because of the goverment owning and controls Nasa that Nasa is lying to us like the goverment could be because of their secret projects. The reason the goverment doesnt tell s about some of their plans is because its to keep the United States of America safe from the har of foreign countries. Those were the reasons conspiracy theorists think like they do.\n \n All that information can signify that Nasa is not lying to us. Though some people may think they are because they are apart of the goverment .But i think that Nasa is doing a great job and woudnt lie to the press. If they lied to the press they would be utting the U.S goverment a bad public view.",

    essay: "The discovery of the Face on the surface of Mars was thrilling for the public. As a scientest working for NASA, I am constantly debating with others whether or not the Martian mesa commonly referred to as the Face was created by aliens. Many people think that it was created by aliens. However, I disagree with the fact that the Face might have been created by aliens. It is simply another Martian mesa located in the region known as Cydonia.\n \n One of the main reasons the Face was not created by aliens is because there are multiple Martian mesas throughout Cydonia. Martian mesas are commonly found throughout Cydonia, and it would be logical to think that the Face is just another Martian mesa. The only difference between the Face and other Martian mesas is that the Face contains unusual shadows making it look like an actual human face.\n \n Not only are Martian mesas commonly found in Cydonia, pictures taken by spacecrafts have proven that the Martian mesa does not look like a face. Although many people have said that the photo taken by the Viking 1 in 1976 resembles a face, unusual shadows made the Martian mesa take the appearance of a human face. Also, the photo taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 does not have very good resolution. In order to see the Face, the photo taken in 1998 by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had to be taken through wispy clouds which has led some skeptics to believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. However, the photos taken in 2001 by the Mars Global Surveyor are much clearer and have much better resolution. These photos reveal the truth about the Face; it is just another Martian Mesa.\n \n In addition to the fact that the photos reveal the truth, it would be illogical for NASA to keep life on Mars a secret. If NASA was to announce to the public that life on Mars has been found, it would significantly help NASA. More people would support NASA and hope more would be discovered about the life found on Mars and would encourage the government to provide NASA with large amounts of money to learn even more about life on Mars.\n \n Although it would have been cool to know that the Face was created by aliens, there is too much proof to support the fact that it is just another Martian mesa. With such advanced technology in use today, NASA will hopefully make huge discoveries in the near future.",

    essay: "I think that the face is just a natural landform !\n \n In my opinion, scienctificly we should believe there landforms and not aliens. We should believe Scientist at NASA,because they have facts and pictures that look like faces made of landforms. Scientist claim they know the facts of what looks like a landform and they think this is a posibility that this is one of them. Also, We should believe its landforms because nobody has ever seen aliens before they just think that they look like on what they have on social media etc. Even if they look like what we have in pictures that still would NOT be an aliens face!! If you look at the picture it might actually look like a formed face but its not .We should also believe NASA because .. they are scientificly trained to look at these and study things to see and know what they are .. Why would you really believe and think you know whats on the internet instead of believing things that you see! Use research!\n \n In conclusion,I think the face is a landform because if so , aliens do not look like humans and the faces on mars looks like a human face and i think we should stop assuming and go with the facts from NASA.",

    essay: "Have you ever wondered about the Face? The one so talked about, movies and books were made about it? In the late 90's, there was a picture taken of a rather human like landform. But get this\n \n -\n \n it wasn't on Earth! The discussion of whether the landform was alien made or a common Cydonia Martian mesa was huge, and is still fret over today. But lets get real, the possibility of the landform being alien made is surreal - with our advanced technology today, we would know!\n \n About twenty-five years ago, an interesting picture was found with one of NASA's spacecrafts, Viking 1. From the region Cydonia of the 'Red Planet', Viking 1 had taken a picture of a large face that stretched almost two miles wide. The landform became better known as the Face. When the picture was released to public, it was a big deal. Scientists had begun to figure it was just another Martian mesa that just happened to have unusual shadows. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", paragraph two even states this. These shadows caused many people to assume it looked similiar to some kind of Egyptian Pharaoh. The general public, although amazed by the coincedence it had been, couldn't have ignored the sayings of a scientist, especially when all the facts come into play with the logical explanation - not aliens!\n \n Even with the scienctists saying what was undeniably the truth, people demanded proof. Few scientists believed the chance of the Face being put there by exterestrial beings, but getting images became one of NASA's priorities. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take ten times sharper images of the Face. In the paragraph seven, you could find that thousands of people were waiting, waiting for an image that may decide what exactly the Face had been. After the image had been taking, not everybody was happy. This resulted in many suggestions as to why there was no proof of aliens having made the Face. It was winter and hazy. Reading through paragraph eight of the article, you can also find many of the excuses used to try and find proof of aliens exsistence.\n \n With many complaints under their belts, Mars Global Surveyor went for another go. This time on a cloudless summer day. On Apri 8, 2001, they were sent in for another look at the Face. The images, taken again, did not show any proof of aliens. To many conspiracy lovers dismay, the images were rather like Earth Landforms. Instead of alien markings, they found that the Face is equivalent to butte or mesa. Even common to landforms in the American West. In paragraphs ten, eleven, and twelve, you can read through the precautions taken to find even clearer images of the Face, though nothing had changed. Without any other evidence to go off of, what could the theorists say?\n \n Others, such as conspiracy theorists, say that NASA has found evidence of the other life forms. They may be right, stating things such as this. But they also say that NASA is withholding this information. While that may be a good idea for other people, NASA's budget says otherwise. With the information of alien exsistence out, their funds could go up a rather lot. Would it be a good idea to hold this information to the public? Especially when it will not only be informing the people, but also helping NASA discover more about our universe.\n \n As stated the possibility of us not coming across alien lifeforms with todays technology is unlikely. With all the precautions they took to prove (or in this cause, disprove) alien exsistence, it is highly unprobable that we missed them. With the scientist, looking over the images twice, and then checking them, the answer is in lockdown. And even if we were, sharing the information is in almost everyone's best interest. If it had been aliens, we surely would have known, wouldn't we? Unless, of course, the aliens could were invisible. How about you tell THAT to the conspiracy theorist?",

    essay: "Every theory needs to have proof, or else no one will want to believe the idea. Theorys though, are just ideas or thoughts people have. Its hard to link a day dream to scientific facts. The statement that the Face was created by aliens is nonsense. There are no facts to back the idea up. Aliens haven't even been proved to be real! People need to understand that the Face is just a mesa, a type of landform that be found on Earth aswell.\n \n If the aliens were real, don't you think something would have changed by now? There is absolutley no sign of any life near the mesa; not even on the planet. If the aliens did exist then we should have noticed some sign. The statement that the Face is only a landform is clearly correct, unlike the idea that creatures formed it into Mars.\n \n The statement that the Face is just a mesa has lots of proof to back it up. There are many sets of pictures, including the pictures from the original Viking itself. The Viking was the spaceship on Mars that helped capture the landform on camera. There are also pictures from recent explorations that further prove that the Face is just a landform.\n \n I think one of the reasons people like to dream up conspiracys is because of the other ideas spread by celebritys. People like talk show hosts spread there ideas for large groups of people to hear, causing people to further think on those ideas. Plus the movie that was made about the Face doesn't help by mixing the facts up. If I were to give you one piece of advice it would be to stick to the facts. Late night dreams won't get you far in a lab or other place of scientific study. The Face is just a landform, nothing more, nothing less.",

    essay: "Some people may think that the Face on Mars was made by aliens. Today I am here to share with you that scientificly it is just a natural landform. It is just a conspericy that the Face was made by aliens. The Mars Global Surveyor captured photos of what the Face looks like from above Mars. The image shows a landform on the planet that seems to look very much like a face.\n \n The Face on Mars is scientificly known to be a landform in the planet. This landform is much like the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. The landform just so happens to look like a face. That's why many people believe that the lanform is was actually made by aliens. Do you know how there are craters on the moon? If so the \"Face\" is almost like that but instead of the crater going in, it's pushing outward. That is the easiest way to describe it.\n \n So far NASA has not found aliens to be real. That doesn't meant that they aren't real. It just means that the face is highly unlikely to be made by aliens. But one day if NASA does discover aliens that might be a possibility that the \"landform\" was made by aliens. But until that day comes around it will just be considered a landform based on scientific facts.\n \n The first spacecraft to see this landform was NASA's Viking 1 in 1976. Then 18 years later, on April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. The picture that the MOC was 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. This became very popular at that time in the past. The Face was used in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens.\n \n So in all the Face was not made by aliens at all. It just happens to be a natural landform in the shape of a face. I can see where everyone got mistaken but the facts are that it was not made by aliens. So now you will be able to say that you know a lot of things about the Face on Mars!

    essay: "On May 24, 2001, Mars was the topic of conversation with those at NASA and other space stations who were included on the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission. On that day, the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. On the other hand, its sister ship, Viking 2, spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. According to Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, the face on Mars resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. But one argument leaves many citizens guessing: Is the face on Mars a true natural landform?\n \n Most at the NASA space station argue that the face is in fact a true natural landform. The face would be considered a natural landform because there isn't actual proof that aliens had created the landform. This statement meaning that there isn't, for example, video footage proof of the landform being created by aliens, which could have been something that could prove that the face is either natural or unnatural. Another reason why this face could be a natural landform is that no one has actually lived on Mars, so no one could stand up and say whether or not it's natural. For the face to be natural, Mars itself would've had to go through natural causes such as erosion or a quake for the face to be created.\n \n On the other hand, it's easy to see why people would think that the face was created by aliens. In the history of the world, many peculiar events have happened where nobody knew how they happened. For example, all over the Earth, there have been cases of weird patterns appearing in corn fields and mazes. People would say that the patterns were created by aliens, so many just say that weird occurences are due to weird, foreign beings: Aliens. Furthermore, another reason why people would think that the face was created by aliens that ties into the other side of the argument is that since no human being has lived on Mars, there is no factual evidence that states that the face was created by natural causes or by aliens; but since aliens live on Mars and other planets in space, people are forced to make the conclusion that aliens made them.\n \n In conclusion, some people don't even have an opinion and they just believe the scientific evidence over the belief that aliens had created them. People might believe this evidence because some people, in fact, don't even believe in aliens at all. But the face could very well be a natural landform due to natural causes such as erosion of the planet or quakes in Mars that formed the face. Or if there are aliens on Mars, the face-according to some people- could've also been created by aliens that lived on Mars. But according to the scientists and chiefs at NASA, the Mars Exploration Program, and other space stations involved in the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission, the face on Mars was only created by natural occurrences and they try to get people to believe it by plastering it all over Hollywood movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.",

For example, Garvin says that it reminds him of most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n \n This mysterious figure on Mars had turned out to be just natural landform called a mesa. The evidence and details have proven that through pictures and comparison. There is no longer a need to believe any alien monument or life on Mars. Sure, the viking 1 photo gave an illusion, but the MGS image from 2001 gives more evidence to what it really is. Thanks to Malin's teams, that caputured an extraodinary photo to prove the truth.",

    essay: "In this argument I'm going to tell you why the face on Mars, is acually a landform.\n \n On the red planet called Cydonia A.K.A Mars. Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars snapping photos of landing sites when they came across a landfrom that looked like a human face. When scientist saw the picture they thought it was just another martian mesa, that is common around in Mars, but it had unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA showed the image for all to see. The caption was \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth.\" They thought it would be a good way to attract attention, but some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization in Mars, although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact. The first image appered on a web site, revealing... a natural landform it was actually a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landform common around the american west\n \n That was my argument I hope you will take my side that the face was not created by aliens and it was mearly a landform.",

    essay: "When it comes to alien life forms, people on Earth have found very few signs that they exisit. With the signs we have found, our technology now a days has proved the aritifacts to be just conspiracies. One of the great conspiracies of aliens started with a picture in 1976. The picture was from a part of Mars that wasn't explored very often. Since people have been curious about aliens for years, they blew the picture out of proportion which started a chain reaction of people thinking that aliens were among us.\n \n One of the many reason that prove this landform wasn't made by aliens is that the technology wasn't very advanced when the picture was first taken. This first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Viking 1 was taking pictures of Mars when the camera took a very hazy and blurred picture of a really big rock. Since the technology wasn't very advanced at the time, scientists couldn't see if the rock was shaped like a face or just shadows reflecting off of the rock to make it look like a face. No one was very certain what it was.\n \n Since no one knew exactly what the rock was, the public took the opportunity to make a really big deal about it. Back in the 70's and 80's aliens were a big deal. People wanted to believe that aliens were among us. Because the rock looked like a face, people wanted to know if the Face was made by aliens or if it was just another landform. To get the public stirring, there were movies, books, magazines, and radio talks shows about it to give consumers what they wanted, a real life alien colony.\n \n In 2001, NASA decided to get another picture of the Face. When the picture was sent out to the public, all of the rave about the Face was snuffed out because the picture looked exactly like a landform. Scientists then closed all exploration on the Face because the picture didn't look anything like a Face. It just looked like a plain, old, boring mesa. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Program even said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in Idaho. Since the picture was so exact, if there was any life in the picture, the scientists could've seen it in the picture.\n \n Aliens are still being researched today, but back in 1976, the rave of the Face created by aliens was all fake. Since the picture taken in 1976 in so blurry, we can't see exactly if it's a face or not. Then when the new picture was taken in 2001, we could easily see that the Face that was made by aliens was actually just a mesa or butte. All of the publicity that the Face got was just because at the time people wanted to know if there were actually aliens out there. The public have started some crazy conspiracies, but this one about the alien Face will always be remembered as one of the craziest conspiracies in space exploration history.",

    essay: "FINAL DRAFT\n \n MONTH_DAY_YEAR\n \n PROPER_NAME\n \n Face On Mars\n \n Hello my name is Scientist STUDENT_NAME. I would like to tell you somemfacts about the \"face on Mars\" that me and some other scientist have discovered. You have probably heard that he face was created by aliens. You also might have heard some fact and some opinion. I am here to help you understand more about it.\n \n First off i would lke to say people have there own opion, but when it comes to facts you cant say its wrong. I have done a lot of research over the past 24 years. We have used different objects to capture pictures over time. The Viking 1 photo shows an enormous head almost 2 miles from end to end, with a face on it.\n \n The face became a priority to me and some scientists. The Mars Blobal Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet on in September,1997. The MGS flew over the face, Michael Malin and his Mars camera team took a picture that was 10 times sharper then the first photo. The photo revield thtthere was no alien monument at all it was a natural landform.\n \n On April 8,2001 the MGS got close enough to get a second, bettr picture. There were no objects in the face. If there was you would be able to see them,because each picture was 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters.\n \n So, the face is actually the Martian or a butte or mesa. Which are landforms common around American West. Therefore, the face was not created by aliens, and didnt have any object in it. Maybe you could do some more research about it .",

    essay: "No way can that actually be made by aliens. The pictures don't lie, it is a natural mesa. We haven't even found life yet so how can we assume this is made by aliens.\n \n The face is really just an illusion. It is just a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that, ironically, make it look like a face. We only released it to the public to get an attraction to Mars. The program didn't mean for all these conspiracies. All we wanted was some publicity for mars.\n \n We even took another, better picture to prove it. I know not all people believe us that it isn't an alien monument. If you look at the picture though, it is clearly a natural landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the original. Still you doubt are findings about the landform.\n \n Again, I think whole-heartedly that it is natural. You can believe what you think it is. We don't even know of life on Mars, how can aliens make it if none are even there. You can be a fool and think that it is a alien monument, but the pictures show it. It is nothing but a perfectly natural monument on the possibly populated Mars.\n \n You may never believe me unless you go there and see it yourself. Personally it easily shows to be a natural landform. Many believe to this day that aliens made that structure and that it is impossible to have a natural sturctue of that likeness. Then again many more believe that it is perfectly natural and just an illusion.",

Each pixel in he 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. As a rule of thump you can dicern things ina digital image 3 times bigger than a pixel size, if there were objects in this picture like houses airplain or any oter object you coold se what they were!.

    essay: "Giant human face discovered on Mars! NASA phototgraphed an image of a landform on Mars specifically a region called Cydonia that showed the feature of a human face. Some think that Face was created by aliens. Although scentific evidence proves that the Face is a natural land form.\n \n When the Face first got phototgraphed NASA \"unveiled the image for all to see.\" in an attempt to get people to be more interested in mars. \"Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rahter hide, say conspiracy theorist.\" Yet the article goes on th say \"Few scientis belebed that Face was an alien artifact...\" This means that many scientiss knew that the Face was a landform form the very beginning but only used it to get money for NASA to research more about Mars. Not only this but the weather was not an ideal time for the image to be taken.\n \n When the image was taken it was at a certain time, year, and season. \" this on had unusual shadows...\" means that the sun was not hitting it deredctly to elliminate any shawdows that were there. \"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north...where it was winter in April'98-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Plant.\" This proves that the weather does have an effect on the image. Not only that but the image taken at this time was cloudy and reveladed a natural landform. The article goes on to say \"a cloudless summmer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...Malin's tean captured an extrodinary photo using the carmera's absolute maximum resoluiton.\" Meaning that the image was as clear as it could be and there were no clouds to make the image blurry. \"What the pictue actually shows is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" This proves that landforms like these were also seen on Earth and alien did not make it. Plus landforms like it had been seen on Earth\n \n Further more, this is not the first time a natural landform has been seen on Mars. In the passage it is stated \"Scienetist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one has unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This means that in the location where the Face was discovered landforms were common and nothing more than natural.\n \n An image of a face was photographed on Cydonia. NASA proved that the Face is only a natural landform on Mars and with enough eveidence to support it. The giant \"human\" face is just another natural landform and most definatly wasn't created by aliens on Mars.",
