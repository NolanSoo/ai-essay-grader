    ESSAY: "Unmasking the Face on Mars\n \n \"Come over here quick!\" As I told my NASA crew members, I told them that I had found something. Hi i'm a scientist at NASA diccusing the face that another scientist thinks it was created by aliens. As i told them they all came and was wondering what I needed them for and if I found clues. \"I think I found parts of the face that is not an aliens.\" states one of the scientist at NASA. We didn't find anything unusual, except that there may be more than one of the faces.\n \n Many of the scientist are starting to wonder if this face was created by aliens. Scientists have tooked camera over and there is no alien monument after all, But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied. The face on mars is located 41 degress north latitude. The camera they had been using had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. They said the aliens marks may have been hidden by haze but some didn't even think that their were aliens marking and said that it is just a natural landform, but then again how could they prove it.\n \n April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time ever. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal photos. Many anxious web surfers were waiting for the first image to appear on their screens. All they got was a natural landform no sign of alien transformation.\n \n Lastly, NASA had many images for web surfer to see. The caption that they had noted underneath was huge rock formation. Which is resembles a human head. It is formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose and mouth. The authors reasoned that it would be a good way t engage and attract the public attentions to Mars.\n \n What the picture was actually showing was the martian equivalent if a mesa or a landform. Which was common around the AMerican West. It reminds many people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idoho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same size as the face on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.\n \n The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.\n \n Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.",

Haha,..nope just a natural landform.\n \n Only a few scientist thought that the face was an artifact, but as soon as NASA heard this the made it a priority to go back and photograph Cydonia once again. Jim Garvin says \"We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" (Paragraph 6) This mean if it was an alien artifact NASA would have made money and benifited from finding this.\n \n However, when Michael Malin went back and photgraphed this again it revealed only a natural landform.(Paragraph 7) Later when others went back again to photograph it they were fortunet enough to get close enough to get a clear picture. (Paragraph 10)\n \n The picture acutally only shows the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.(Paragraph 12) Too bad for all those scientist who thought this was an alien artifact.

    ESSAY: "When the face on Mars was first descovred from a region of the planet called Cydonia first found in 1976, many people thought it might have been created by aliens. However this is not true, the face on this planet is a natural landform. The face is a natural landform because it is equivalent to a Martian mesa, there were no ther objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.\n \n The face on Mars is a mesa. A Martian mesa is commen around the area of Cydonia. The mesa is only seen as a face because it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The shadows give the rock formation the ilolusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.\n \n There were no other objects seen in any of the pictures that had been taken. Michael Malin's team captured an extraordinary picture using the camers's maximum resolution. \"As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size\" Garvin explaned. So if there were any objects in this picture such as airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even a small shack it would have been seen in the pictures.\n \n There was no alien movement detected on Mars. If it was aliens that created this face the camers's would have picked up the movement and captured pictures. On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed a natural landform proving there was no alien movement.\n \n The Face on Mars is a natural landform that looks like a face becasue of the shadows it was formed by. The Face is a natural landform that was not created by aliens because it is equivelant to a Martiam mesa, there were no other objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.",

    ESSAY: "This face landform stucture found on Mars was not made by any living source. I belive nature took its course and it so happened to look like a face. Eyes, nose mouth it looks like a face no doubt about it, but it cannot be stuctured by living substances. Most scientists have been saying that this face was made by aliens, but I have to disagree. It just simply can not.\n \n I belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times. There is basically no evidence that aliens have built this landface.\n \n Well If you still do not belive me and still think aliens have built this landface than I think you are insane because I gave you a bunch of reasons why there is no way and there is no evidence that aliens have built this landface. Everybody should be on my side and say mother nature has built this face, but untill there is prove aliens exist I don't think aliens should be in the topic about this.",

    ESSAY: "The face on Mars is just a natural landform. Their's really no existense of aliens, because theres no proof of them. The face is just a landform that was created with Mars. On Earth we have landforms that look like faces and other things that were created with Earth. There's also no proof that there's life on Mars, becuase there really isn't life on Mars.\n \n The existence of aliens is false, humans and animals are the only life forms out there pretty much. If there were proof of aliens then why arn't they on Earth then? Aliens never made that on Mars, that face was created when Mars was. NASA just used the face to get money, because this face was starred in a Hollywood film, it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store check out lines for 25 years. Then after that they really didn't care for the face anymore. Everyone was not really satisfied with the face on Mars.\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-- landforms common around the American West. Garvin a scientist even says that it reminds him of the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also says \"That's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n As you can see the face was never created or made by aliens. The face was created with mars. In the story, it even says that the landform was basically created with Mars. So in fact there is no existence of aliens and there is no life on Mars.\n \n In the ending of the story, it basically says the face is just a landform, it tells the height and everything about it. They even say that they don't pass over the face that much anymore. So it's just a true fact that the face a landform, they even said it was just a natural land form.",

    ESSAY: "Do you believe that the face on Mars is made by aliens? I know my opinion doesnt matter, what matters is whats real. I know you are also thinking that this is crazy, because we all know aliens do not exist. There is no proof of aliens.\n \n It has to be a natural landform, because in the 12th paragraph Garvin said it reminded him of Most Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. Our universe can create anything, just because something look like it was made does not mean it is. There could of been rocks there, and the dust just blows around them. Making it look like it was made, by something or someone. The very most obvious thing is aliens do not exist, there has been no proof of alien. Even to this day in 2016 there is still no proof of aliens.\n \n In the 3rd paragraph NASA even mentioned it as a \"huge rock formation\" scientist are very smart if there was other such thing that made it, it would have already been discovered. Also the face on Mars was a good way to get attention, like paragraph number 5 said so. The face of Mars turned into a famous pop icon. It was on Hollywood films, all the way to Haunted grocery store check out lines. If people could get the public to think that it was aliens that made the face, it would have maybe become way more popular. Plus most people do not believe in such thing as aliens, if they do not have real proof.\n \n My very last example is , if NASA found out was aliens they would have already told the public. It would be huge for NASA to discover aleins. There is no way they would hide the proof that aliens are real. It would help their budget, if they did discover an ancient alien civilization on mars. As it says in paragraph 6 scientist started hunting for more information. It became a priority for them. All the pictures they took revealed it as a natural landformation as it says in paragraph 7.\n \n There is no way it is related to Aliens. So if someone says that NASA is just hiding it, it would be false. NASA would surely reveal that there is aliens on another planet. Just imagine how much attention they would get if they actually discovered it. They would probably be one of the richest people. It is positive that a face on mars, made by aliens is not real.

    ESSAY: "Now there hasnt been real information on the existence of aliens or any other lifeforms of that kind. Stories behind those creatures are usually made up by many people. We dont have any evidence as to seeing or taking pictures of any aliens or UFO's. So why would aliens be on Mars?\n \n Due to the fact that researchers have identified that the \"Face\" is juast a mesa, I think is safe to say that there are no alien life forms on mars and there never was.\n \n Nasa has very good cameras that are way better than the ones in 1976. They can zoom in way more and take 3-D images as well. if there were aliens living on there you would be able to see UFO's and a whole lot of aliens on the planet. And if there were Egyptioan style pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see them to. The \"Face\" is a martian equivalent to a butte or mesa as scientifically proven by scientist.\n \n Another reason as to why the mesa on mars is a landform and not some alien made artifact is that in the article it said that there were shadowns giving off the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. \"Its a good way to enage the public and attract attention to mars\", as said in the story. Also making the Face a pop icon also would make more people think that there really is life on mars without any real evidence. The face appeared on movies and magazines, which made more and more people follow this trend of life on mars.\n \n The final reason as to why the object on mars is just a landform and not an alien made thing is that on a cloudy, wispy day, the photo was taken. Making it seem like the aliens did it on purpose. But, scientist took the photo again on a less cloudier day and found out that is was just a landfrom after all. when they shot it with their better camera, it showed that is was just made by mars just like earth makes its own lanforms sometimes. So it seems as though technology from back then just wasnt updated enough to get the job done.\n \n Ultimately, the reason that evryone thought that there were life on mars is because technology wasnt as evolutionized as it was in 2001 compared to 1976. With the technology today, we would be able to find out right away if there were actually life on mars. So in conclusion, there is not life on mars and there never was.",

The picture shows a Martian like butte or mesa.\n \n After all the research Garvin says, \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" By saying that its pretty clear that is was any of what you may be thinking. Before all the research I though it was an alian or a creture too . Now there is nothing to worry about is just a natural landform just like Earth have some too.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as \"The Face on Mars.\" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.\n \n Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.\n \n On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.\n \n Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was. Now NASA had proved that this brilliant \"face\" was only a landform.\n \n NASA did endless amounts of research in hopes of finding evidence of martian life, so why would they hide something like that? Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform. The research NASA has put into may not have given them the results they wanted, but it may later benefit them in finding life on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist I had to discusss the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation of the face on Mars giving the mosts reasonable and lucid -something clearly shown- ideas. There is many reasons why this \"face\" was not made by aliens. As a scientist I had to explain some evidence that would show what this \"face\" is classified as. Also I had to show the main ideaology on these speculations or conspiracies that \"know\" what NASA is doing. My main job as scientist is to observe, study, and explain many mysteries but I had to use clearly expressed qualifications for the face to be created by aliens.\n \n For my first reasoning on this topic I had to discuss this person how this landform is classified as mesa or butte which occurs normally in many environments. Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, \"It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\" showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!\n \n After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.\n \n Another type of reasoning this \"face\" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this \"face\" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the \"face,\" shows that the \"face\" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a \"face\" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.\n \n Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.\n \n So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the \"face\" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the \"face\" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.",

    ESSAY: "The \"face on mars\" is not a real face. The face is a mesa or butte that looks like the ones found in the American west. It looks like a face by the shadows that form on it. The camera that found the \"face on mars\" was old and later a new one took a picture that can clearly see the surface. The new camera cannot be argued with because it is the latest and clearest. Also why would NASA try to hide the fact that there was aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them alot.\n \n The mesa or butte on mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kindof sounds dumb. If you think about it in the way i do it would be lke an alien race looks down on our planet saw a mesa that looked like a face and thought we knew he was there and wanted look at him/her/it.\n \n Also dont you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the \"face\" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock.\n \n If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they was going to wait for a clear day too so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine,and the image is completely real too.\n \n If ther was really aliens on mars it would benefit them alot. Think about it why woul NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollors to study them. Also if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way,because what if they had technolligy we didn't wouldnt we already have it? If there were aliens wouldnt they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war.\n \n The \"face on mars\" is totally fake. Now that ive bestowed upon you my knowledge maybe you can pass it on to other conspiracy theorists. Then maybe the \"face on mars\" thing wil finally blow over. Next time something like this happens you can probably look into that further too. Also maybe just maybe conspiracy theorists might come to an end.",

They could've ruled us by now. The Face is a natural landform on Mars.\n \n To prove that this was not caused by aliens, NASA reported,\" Huge rock formation which resembles a human head that is formed by shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It is all just an illusion.

    ESSAY: "This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.\n \n The only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says \"Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all\". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?\n \n Scientists say that in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West\". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.\n \n But, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. \" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze\". So right now it shows that there could be a possibility that aliens could have made the Face. This one piece of evidence could be the evidence they are looking for.\n \n In conclusion, no one knows what made this interesting Face on Mars. But we do have a lot of information about what could have made it if it wasnt aliens. When we don't have a lot of information here, we can not really think what this Face was made by.

So we decide to send the picture back to NASA to see what they had to say about it. There replies where so shocking to us we could not belive it they that the face had been created by aliens.\n \n Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this.\n \n Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this.

    ESSAY: "If I were a scientist at NASA and I was disucussing the Face with someone who doesn't think the Face was just landformation I would say, it is because of what other scientist in NASA believe it was a landformation that looked like a real human face.\n \n The Face was just something formed by the planet because the artical says, \"huge rock formation... which resemles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Which means that is was just a rock that was formed a different way to look like it was a face. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but there were more scientist to prove them wrong. Another piece of evidence was when they were taking pictures Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. This evidence goes with my argument because if it was some type of alien siglnal the camera would of picked it up and they would of seen what it really was, but they didn't all they saw was a landform like the ones around American West.\n \n In conclution it was not an alien signal, or artifact, it was just a piece of land formed differently. Now you all know it wasn't from aliens. All it was, was an illusion that looked like a real human face with a nose, eyes, and more. Don't assume everything on other planets are always from aliens because for now we don't have proof aliens exist.",

    ESSAY: "The fae on mars is just another landform. I think this becasue there are land forms that form exactly like it on earth, and why would the government let us see pictures of it if it was an artifact from some alien civilization.\n \n The face on mars is just a messa. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" So infact it is not an artifact of a alien civilization because there are landforms just like it on earth from domes of lava that take the shape of an isolated mesa.\n \n If this was an actuallly conspirasy than why is it not being hidden from us. \"Although few scitests believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the REad Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.\" They did not take more pictures becasue they believed that there was some kind of alien artifact, they took mare pictures because the pictures they had from before were eighteen years old. So things on mars could have changed during those eighteen years.\n \n After all of the proving that it was not an alien artifact there were still some skeptics. \"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze.\" Then NASA took more pictures on a clear sunny day and used a really high pixalization to show people that if there were peryamids on mars they would be able to see them in the picture.\n \n This just shows to prove that the face on mars is just in fact a landformation and not an alien artifact. NASA has proved many times again and again that this mestry face is not mare that just a mesa that formed on mars. Skeptics will keep tring to prove NASA wrong but there is not another logical explainization than the Face just being a landform on mars.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars is not what everyone thinks it is. Hollywood shows, magazines, and radio talk shows can exaggerate to make the landform sound like more than what it truly is. As a NASA scientist, I believe that you should know exactly what this historic landmark is, so you know the correct story for years to come.\n \n First, you never know what publicity will do with the next big story. Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. \"Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.\n \n To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. \"....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.\" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.\n \n In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",

    ESSAY: "Why do you believe the face was created by aliens? When looking at this image, you can think about that at first but if you believe it immediately, then there is something wrong about that. I will explain to you why the face was not created by aliens though i will also explain why someone may believe that.\n \n The face is an image we found in 2001 that was taken by our Viking 1 spacecraft that was circling the Mars. The face is an area of land on Mars that has the illusion of a face. The illusion of the face comes from the shadows making the land look like it has a nose, eyes, and a mouth that resembles a human face. It was a surprise for most people here at NASA but we didn't believe it was alien works immediately because we didn't have any real evidence of it. It just so happened to be a patch of land that looked like a face.\n \n We couldn't say it was made by aliens because we needed proof of that and we haven't studied Mars' enough to prove that aliens made the face. We know Mars is similar to Earth but it's still a different planet in our solar system. Although we hoped it might've been an alien civilization, we studied the face more and it was simply a landform similar to a mesa or butte of our world.\n \n Even though we know it was just a landform, there are reasons we could see people saying it might've been made by aliens. We know Mars is able to sustain life because of it's conditions and there has been few deposits of water found there, but we have never found an actual living species on the planet itself. We as humans still don't know if aliens live on Mars or if aliens from other worlds exist at all. Many people believe there are aliens from other planets and some don't really care about the subject at all but it is possible that there's life on other planets.\n \n Because we haven't figured out if Mars has life, people believe the strange and convinient findings on Mars (like the face) are works of alien beings. Although we have confirmed the face was not a work of aliens, we still don't know if aliens exist. We can conclude that the face is not the work of aliens but there just might be unearthly beings on our neighboring planet, Mars. Before we can confirm there are alien beings on Mars, we would need evidence to explain they do exist at all. But we can conclude, the face is not made by aliens.",

According to the text it states,\"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible.

Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too.

    ESSAY: "Have you ever wanted to be apart of NASA or a scientist? Scientist get to explore many parts of the world, even outer space. Have you ever wanted to travel to Mars known as the, \"Red Planet?\" Mars has a long history, however some NASA scientists say that in 1967 they saw a face on Mars and some people thought that aliens created it.\n \n Twenty-Five years ago from this date May 24, 2001 a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars taking pictures of possible landings for the sister ship named Viking 2. As the spacecraft was circling around the planet Mars, it saw something very odd which was, shadowy likeness of a human face with and enorumous head nearly two miles from the end it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on the red planet called Cydoina. Soon scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, however this one had unsusual shadows which made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n As NASA looks at the images the caption said \"huge rock formation.\" The Mars then started to reveal images of a face such as the, eyes, nose, and mouth. Mars has now became a famous planet. The planet Mars has starred in Hollwood flims, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery story checkout line.\n \n The agurment now is weither or not the face was made by aliens and the answer is NO. In passage seven, it says, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orgional Viking photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landfrom. There was NO alien monument after all.\n \n I believe if I was in the NASA or if I were a scientist I would use passage seven to back my answer up. It gives all the details about why the aliens did not make the face on the planet Mars. Even though everyone would not be satisfied with my agurement, I now have proof that it was not created by aliens.",

    ESSAY: "Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.\n \n First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people.\n \n Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.\n \n Of course, people still weren't satisfied. Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face. After extensively studying the pictures, Jim Garvin states that it \"is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\". He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West. The Face is just a regular landform.\n \n In conclusion, that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Almost 30 years of research went by until they came to their conclusion. The Face is only a meer mesa. It was created naturally, and not by aliens. No one can argue with facts!",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist of NASA, I can say that \"The Face\" is in fact a landform. We made this conclusion when we first snapped a picture 10x faster of the face, we also took a second look and picture, and it has simalarites like a natural landform from the Snake River Plain of Idaho on Earth. But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory.\n \n In 1998 on April 5, for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. A picture was captured 10x better than the orginal viking photos. they were later posted on a website for the public to see but for the people who thought it was a sign of life on Mars, they were wrong. Scientist's said it was just a natural landform.\n \n For the second time, the scientist could yet again reach Cydonia once again to turn their conspiracy theory to fact. Others back on Earth said it was too windy and it made the clouds affect the picture. This time researchers used a maximum resolution camera to prove the theorists wrong. Yet again Garvin said, \" If there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were.\"\n \n Scientist said that the \"face\" was equivalent to a butte or mesa. They made this staement because there is something similar to it on Earth in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These are found around the American West. Garvin said, \" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the \"Face on Mars.\"\n \n On the other side of things, there were many conspiracy theorists that questioned NASA's claim. Everyone wasn't satisfied with the pictures that were first taken people said it was during a cloudy season, that's why there was another trip with more advanced equipment. They also stated that the camera on board had to go through the clouds and dust to see the face so the picture couldn't been shown clearly. Another claim they made is that since there were wispy clouds the alien markings could be hidden in the haze and scientists just didn't look hard enough.\n \n In conclusion we have the facts that we need to prove that \" The Face\" is just a natural landform. We have provided the public with two pictures. Plus we also made observations that it looked like a landform from here on Earth. As NASA, we would like to see the conspiracy theorists prove us wrong then they could state the facts for once.",

    ESSAY: "So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.\n \n My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.\n \n My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?\n \n The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. \"It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Garvin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.\" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.\n \n My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?\n \n This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.",

    ESSAY: "Many people, including nasa, believe that \" the Face\" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.\n \n First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.\n \n Secondly, the only reason it \"has\" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.\n \n Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.\n \n Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.\n \n Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",

    ESSAY: "Is There Really a Face on Mars???\n \n The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).\n \n When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.\n \n Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).\n \n Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.",

    ESSAY: "I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there.

    ESSAY: "The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.\n \n The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.\n \n Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.\n \n The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",

Very few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian Messa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" However, people thought it was a real face. When the picture went online or on TV, people thought it was \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Even though some people are defenders of NASA, we still shouldn't give them money to see if there is an actual ancient civilization. If we do we could possibly be putting that money to waste. We should think about if the pictures are real or if they were photoshopped.\n \n However, NASA has confirmed it a messa. Which is a natural landform. Since it is windy or cloudy on Mars this messa could have been pushed around to make it look like a face. Even though we got pictures we would still be able to see things like airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks. We could have actually seen those on the ground. NASA dosen't even pass over the face that often. In contrast, we would not be able to get much information on it. So we should not even worry about how to figure out what it is.\n \n Therefore, when scientists Jim Garvin says it reminds him of \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" we should think about how is he right. When a scientists says something big and important we are listening and comparing something on Earth to Mars means that it could have been caused by erosion. Even though we are just getting pictures of it isn't enough. We could have better pictures now then they did back then. In conclusion, erosion and plains on earth come naturally. We have no idea what that could be made of it could be made of, sand for all we now.\n \n Therefore, we may have confirmed pictures it is a face. But do we have pictures that it is not just darker sand. The face could be anything on Mars. Because their pictures confirmed it a messa, it is a natural landform. In contrast, it formed naturally. Just like how it looks like Middle Butte in Idaho. Which was formed naturally. If this gets people saying that their could be life on Mars we probably would have found it by now.\n \n All in all, if the face was real then why don't we have more advanced pictures of it. NASA only has older pictures of this so called \"Face\", it looks like a natural landform in Idaho. So next time NASA gets people crazy about another ancient alien civilzation, think about how they need to prove it.",

    ESSAY: "Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.\n \n First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?\n \n NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.\n \n If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.\n \n Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",

    ESSAY: "I know this wasn't created by aliens in many ways. It is just a naturally created landform that looks like face. If it was created by aliens then NASA would benefit from discovering life on a different planet, so that shows that everyone in NASA is sad that we didn't find life. Landforms created from nature shouldn't be lied about just to get attention. That is why we don't tell other people a lie when it is just a landfrom like the Grand Canyon. Here are also reasons how I know it wasn't created by aliens.\n \n Some rock formations on Earth are created by wind chipping off peices until one day the rocks are completely gone. We didn't have any control of the winds that created the rock formations, so that shows that nothing living created it. Around the face is other landforms that were created the same way the Face was made. The Face is the only one that people pay attention to becuase it looks like a face, but if you look at the entire picture you can see that other landforms are there that might not look like a face, but they show that landforms are created naturally there.\n \n These examples show us that these landforms were not created by aliens, but by the weather that accurs there. That is why we shouldn't lie just to get attention and make everybody believe something that isn't real. This concludes that the Face was only created by weather like the landforms on Earth.",

    ESSAY: "I know people think the face on Mars is something that was created by some kind of life, but really it is not. This is acually just a landform. The face was found in the region of the red planet called Cydonia. It is very hard for NASA to get the picture because they have to angle the satalite just right. I am not trying to be pestimistic but, NASA has seen landforms on Mars before and the article says,\"the mouth, nose, and eyes are allusions caused by shadows\". The facts just dose not add up to their being life on Mars.\n \n This face is just a landform. There are many ways this landform could have happend. For example, a duststorm, astroids crashing on the planet, or underground volcanos. These are all examples of how the face could have been created. The article says it was caused by butte or mesa. Time for everyone to come up with a new theory!\n \n This face was found in the area Cydonia. One day the aircraft Viking 1 was circaling the plant and found the face. Could you imagine the scientist face when the aircraft reported it back. A few days later they released it to the public. Lots of people were confinced that it was caused by some kind of lifeform, but really it was not.\n \n It was hard work for NASA to get the picture because they had to rotate the aircraft at 30 degrees. This was not easy because if they went to far Nasa would miss the face. If they did not go all the way around Nasa would still miss it . It had to be perfect. It could have been 29 degrees, one of, but it did not matter it would still miss it. It had to be perfect. NASA finnaly got the picture and proved that there was no lifeform.\n \n The nose, mouth, and eyes are caused by shadow illusions. They might have been formed by astroids crashing there, but are most likely shadow illusions. These illusions are caused when the Mars acsis are tillted a certain way and the sun hits it. This is most likly how the shadow allusion happened. This is what scientist says caused the illusion.\n \n In conclusion there were many ways for this landform to happen. Do not think this was caused by some kind of life form because there is not enough proff. There are many ways this could have been formed. For example. A dust storm, or underground volcano the list goes on. It may never be solved what caused it. Just face it it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars is a very mysterious thing, but it's only been caught on camera, clearly, once, but that was in the 1970s. The cameras in 1976 were not very clear, as you see they have a 43 meter span per pixel, which makes the picture a whole lot more blurry. Even though it's been seen all over the world as an unknown landform or an alien artifact, the evidence has been seen through, and the face, is, well, not really a face at all.\n \n The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars. Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001. Yet the picture doesn't depict an Egyption face staring back at you, but a standard, normal, everyday, Mars mesa. The pictures of the face in 1998 showed clearly that the face wasn't quite a face, with a camera 10 times sharper than the original Viking camera, yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars. Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time. The cameras' span was 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the Viking's 46 meters per pixel, and the planet of Mars was as clear as the eye could see at that time, but there was no unnatural objects to be seen. Yes, it is hard to prove that the famous mesa isn't man-made, you would have to be on the planet to do that, yet the facts and research is all here and it's time to let go.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars has been very iconic on what it has done to the people, and the world as a whole. It's been analyzed and researched over, over, and over again. And it all comes down to the cold hard facts, which all points to the intriging rock of 1976 of being just a rock formation that was, well, lets just say, for now... misunderstood.",

Many people like to make theories about subjects but nobody knows about the real information. Not unless we share it to the public, we will not share things we want to hide from everyone. The picture was not made by aliens and we explain why it is just a natural landform.\n \n If I were to be a scientist at NASA I would tell the person that the Face is just a natural landform. There are many conspiracy theorists that claim we are trying to hide something, such as saying aliens made the Face. In the article it says\n \n \" evidence that NASA would rather hide \" , that is correct. If the aliens did make it then we wouldn't have showed the public the photos. We would want to keep it out of newspapers, magazine, tv shows, and movies.\n \n NASA would also never want lots of people to see the picture of the Face if they were to hid something. We would make the picture an enigma to the citizens of the world. Scientist in NASA have studied these for years and they have all the information. Also in the third paragraph in the article it tells us that there are some shadows that make the the Face get the illusion of having eyes and a nose. The third paragraph says \" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. \" which is telling us that they want people to know more about Mars so we obvisouly wouldn't be showing the pictures if the aliens made it.\n \n Although there were few scientist that believed the Face was an alien artifact, in paragraph seven it says\n \n \" ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. \" , NASA scientist take their jobs very serious. People continued to say the Face markings were made from aliens but the NASA scientist said it was just a natural landform and some of the pictures were made from the shadows. On April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer in Cydonia, Malin's team got an \" extraordinary \" picture of the Face because many people such as the theorists said maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.\n \n In the second paragraph NASA was excited to see if the Face was something sensational and the article says \" Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. \" the only thing that made this one stand out was it has shadows that give it facial features such as a nose, eyes and a mouth. NASA soon showed the picture for all the people to see with a caption telling them what it was. NASA would not show the picture and make up something if the Face was really created by aliens.\n \n In the very last paragraph the article tells us what the picture actually shows from what the scientist at NASA have gathered. Paragraph twelve says \" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. \". The scientist are telling us that the Face is just a landform, as a NASA scientist there is a lot of information about the Face and it was not made by aliens.

I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.\n \n First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.\n \n Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts.

Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.\n \n Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there.

    ESSAY: "For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, \"aliens\" have done so.\n \n In 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.\n \n To conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform. But in reality, no one has the facts to prove that an alien life-form had created this landform. No one has the facts to prove there are alien civilizations on Mars. I only say this because there has not yet been facts, or any information involving alien-life forms or ancient civilizations on mars. Maybe in the future, there will be signs of some type of life-form on Mars, or very odd, peculiar objects that we may find somewhat weird, or, out of the ordinary.

    ESSAY: "I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the \"face\" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.\n \n The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.\n \n Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing.

You can't see all the details.\" At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural.\n \n This Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientists have even compared it to buttes and mesas here on Earth. An example of this comparison was by Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. He said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho stating, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\" Also, Mars is known for being a very dusty and rocky planet. It would be very easy for the formations of Mars to erode together and make such a landform as this.\n \n In addition to it just being a natural landform, there is absolutely no evidence of life near this area or anywhere else. This goes to show that it can't be man/ alien made. The NASA scientists, are using the highest quality cameras in technology today. They zoom in to 1.56 meters per pixel, allowing them to see every little detail. After doing this they found no shelter, no water, no life showing any forms of a civilization. There has never been any life, outside of maybe bacteria, found on Mars, and even if there was, NASA would quadruple their funds after that kind of discovery giving them no reason to hide it.\n \n The Face of Mars is simply a natural landform similar to a butte or mesa similar to those on Earth, with no alien interaction.

    ESSAY: "In the Story \"Unmasking the Face on Mars.\" The face on mars has apparently been founded in 1976, NASA claimed the the face was formed by a alien, Here is were I come in, The world had made a bunch of movies including aliens from mars, Mars, for hundreds maybe thousands of years have been the 'Aliens home'. Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Â“MalinÂ’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameraÂ’s absolute maximum resolution.Â”\n \n That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.\n \n Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â”\n \n This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. Â“huge rock formation....\" It basically says that the rock is a formation \".......giving the illusion......\" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth. I clearly gives out that opinion that if you put it together you get \"A huge rock formations giving the illusion.........\" and so on.\n \n I also think that The 'face' Is just a rock the looks like a face, clearly I stated that. Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...\"over time it transformed .....\" in the text... \"Huge rock FORMation.\" It is just a rock thats looks like a face, and just because it's on mars don't mean a thing.",

    ESSAY: "Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a \"shadowy likeness of a human face\". Shadows on the object give \"the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.\n \n In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.\n \n The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.",

    ESSAY: "There are a variety of perspectives and opinions related to the Face on Mars. Many say that it's simply a lava dome, or that it could just be a strange rock molded in such a way where it may appear to be a face. However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.\n \n This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures. They thought of many different possibilities to why this was formed in a way that reminded us of an Egyptian Pharaoh such as the possibility of the camera's angle, the shadows covering it. Basically we thought of everything minus the chance that it may have been the works of such \"aliens\".\n \n Aliens have been the illogical reasoning to many things we find on the various assortments of planets so hearing that this recent discovery was blamed on aliens isn't very shocking. We spent a few days deciding whether or not to show the images captured to the public, but in the end we decided to do so. The Face on Mars instantly became a well-known subject all over the world things such as movies, magazines, and even radio and tv talk shows all spoke of the mysterious Face on Mars. Many considered this discovery as the new pop icon. During this there were many conspiracy theorists who began to state that the Face on Mars was the work of aliens. However that's the thing, there are no statistical facts simply a load of different conspiracies made from people who strongly believe in such things! Considering there is lack of proof on even the stance that aliens are real the \"case\" was never thoroughly thought through.\n \n There can be various reasonings and opinions about the Face on Mars and though they may be very amusing or interesting to hear, the reality of it is really that it is simply an isolated lava dome. This isn't the first time that natural landforms have represented such things as faces or even common artifacts. There is still research going on about what's casuing these strange formations, but you can be sure that it's not the work of aliens.",

Some conspiracy theorists believe that a face found on Mars from a photo taken by Viking 1 - a Mars Global surveyor -\n \n was created by aliens who lived on the planet over 300 billion years ago. NASA released information and a picture about the 'Face on Mars,' to the media, with the caption, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head.\" The face believed to be found on Mars is nothing less then a rock formation, and was not created by aliens.\n \n Mission controller Garvin says, \"It's not easy to target Cydonia.\" He also noted that his crew does not pass over the Face very often. This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years. Over time the wind and atmosphere has shaped the rock into the form of what looks to be a Face.\n \n NASA leaked evidence about the Face on Mars when they unveiled the image for the public and media to see, stating clearly that the Face was formed by, \"shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see the image on a JPL website, the text in fact quoted, \"It was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n The people that do believe that there was alien life on Mars, think that the aliens markings were hidden by haze, and believe the Face is \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Contarary to what skeptics and other theorists think, there is no actual piece of true evidence discovered by NASA to prove otherwise.\n \n Garvin and his team said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyarmids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" So this actual NASA evidence that the mysterious \"Face\" found on Mars was nothing but a simple landform.\n \n The NASA Space Program has been around for decades. NASA has not yet found evidence to consider the Face on Mars was alien artifacts. Even with NASA's best cameras, there just isn't a theoretical proven fact that this could have become an artifact from ancient aliens.

On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia.\n \n Back at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figures it was just another Matian mesa, around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.\n \n Some might believe that the so called \"alien artifact\" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth.\" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they \"photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it.\" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.\n \n As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the \"camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,\" and according to skeptics, \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that \" It's not easy to target Cydonia,\" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is \"bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.\n \n In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too.

These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976.

The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big.

I've thought about it and I have read this story called \"Unmasking The Face on Mars\" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.\n \n When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption \"...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth.\" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This \"face\" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.\n \n Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage \"It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.\n \n Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that \"the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.\"(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.\n \n After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars\" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all.",

    ESSAY: "The face on mars is not created by aliens this is a natural landform on earth there already were landforms that were created. We can't say aliens made those too. Such as vocanoes, rivers, and mountains we also couldn't say we built those because we didn't. If aliens really did build the face on mars how come their isn't any proof anything was on the planet? If there was any form of a living species you would have at least seen Egyptian- style pyramids or even small shacks.\n \n Mars is a planet that is know for having rocks on it, there is a possibility that this is just a huge rock that was carved into the planet already or the planet it's self got either hit by and astroid or had been forming it's self in some way. Aliens could'nt have build the face they would've needed soem short of unground passege or even shelter's, none of these things were found when we discoverd the face. We get the picture looks blurry btu even with zooming in you can't see any such thing as if there was an alien.\n \n Scientist has studied the photos the astronots had brought home we saw their were may rocks this could have been a mistake. How would an alien know what a human face looks like anyways? By our understand we could be looking at it and imageing it's a face when really it's just a rock that was formed to look like a humans head.\n \n April 5, 1998 when mars Global Surveyor flew oven the face he snapped pictures ten times sharper then the original Viking photos. Thousands of people anxious to have the photo appear on JPL web site by yet still came out with saying that it was just an natural landform. People were not satisfied, this bring's me back to the point were it was just our imagination maybe we're lookingat it wrong it's really meant to look like one thing but were making it look like another.\n \n We belive that if aliens really did make this face how come their wasn't any type of form in which we can tell their was any type of life form living on mars? Landscapes are usual to see on planest and this was one of them. If there was any type of life form i think Michale Malin would have already taken pictures of them if he had seen anything. He didn't which means this face was actually a natural landform.",

    ESSAY: "Do you think the Face on Mars is real? The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. If there was something that made this, they would leave tracks. But there's nothing.\n \n The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. Scientist says it's a \"mesa.\" Which is common in Mars in Cydonia. It also said that NASA said \"a huge rock formation which forms a head, eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" So everything is made out of bunch of rocks. Michel Malin and his Orbiter snapped the picture ten time bigger than the original picture in 1998. So then it revealed a \" natural landform.\" Theres nothing special about. It's was just land. Later on, Malin's team did a second picture but bigger in 2001. Gavin said there were other objects like shack, airplanes, pyramids, etc. They were all made natural. Also, in Earth, there are many landfroms that looks like things. Like Middle Butte in the Snake River. And it is almost the same size as the Face on Mars.\n \n Just because it's on Mars doesn't mean it made by aliens. It's made out of natural. Sometimes strange objects appear around the Earth. Thats because it's normal to the us and enviroment. It's just a natural form. Its just the lack of conspiracy theorist.",

    ESSAY: "The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.\n \n The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of \"The Red Planet\" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.\n \n The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. \" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken.\" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.\n \n Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.\n \n Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity\n \n My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa. The mesa on the planet is only a natural landform that happens to look like a face. Nothing more and nothing less.",

Lastly, their camera would have caught any glimpse of alien markings. These statements are valid because looking at the evidence provided it gives you more facts that any skeptic could.\n \n The passage states that the Face is just the shadow of where the camera was, then creating the affect of the eyes, nose, and mouth that you see in the pictures.

That is not true because in paragraph 11 they state that they can make a pixel 3 times its size.

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1 snapped a photo of what looked to be a Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA released the picture to the public. The \"Face on Mars\" became a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people still believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is the work of aliens. I believe the \"Face on Mars\" is not the work of aliens, but a natural landform.\n \n The article gives good evidence that the \"Face on Mars\" is just another weird natural landform on Mars. In paragraph 5, conspiracy theorists claim the \"Face on Mars\" is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide. In paragraph 3, NASA unveiled the image for all to see in 1976. The caption noted, \"a huge rock formation...which resembles the shape of a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars; which it certainly did just that. The authors of the article wanted to attract attention towards Mars and NASA even claimed that it was a huge rock formation in the caption. Later, stating that shadows gave the huge rock formation the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper and clearer than the original Viking photos. The picture taken in April of 1998, would most likely not have shadows to give illusions of the face, nose, and mouth. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. NASA again stating and proving that the \"Face on Mars\" was just another out of place natural landform on Mars. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Here again we can see NASA trying to prove that the \"Face on Mars\" in still just a weird natural landform on Mars. Someone who stills believes that the \"Face on Mars\" is the work of aliens might say something like this. The \"Face on Mars\" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim. However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001. The photo taken in April 2001, the weather was perfect-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The photo taken that year still looks like a natural landform on Mars.\n \n The excellent reasons stated above prove yet again that the so called \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural landform.

There are also lots of different holes around the landform which means more have must have been formed close by the landform. Also im sure if there was someone or something on Mars when this happened NASA would have saw. The NASA also had said that \"There was no alien monument after all.\" Which means that there must not had have been aliens on Mars after all. So the landform had to just be a natural landform. I honestly don't even think that aliens are even smart enough to know excatly how to prcocess this landform. The landform doesn't look done with any kind of tool or anything so therefore I think that yes the sculpture is a natural landform even though that's kind of weird & the article actually shows that as the years go by the landform starts to form even more.

When our Viking 1 was scanning the planet to find a safe place for the next space craft to land, Viking 2, Viking 1 suddenly \"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" The scientists at first, were excited, but then we realized that it was probably a common Martian mesa. We just assumed that \"this one had unusual shadows.\" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.\n \n Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.\n \n Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was \"winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.\n \n Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a \"cloudless summer day.\" \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,\" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution.

So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin stated.

    ESSAY: "Why does NASA consider the \"Face of Mars\" to be a natural landform? They claim that the \"face\" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.\n \n Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed \"haze\" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.\n \n In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called \"alien face.\" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the \"alien face\" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.\n \n On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure \"resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face of Mars\" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",

When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.\n \n Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up. Landforms can have all kinds of shapes and the face of Mars just has a very unique shape. In conclusion, the face of Mars is just a odd shaped Butte.",

    ESSAY: "Do aliens really exist and are they capable of doing something like this? I don't think they could but if they were capable of doing something like this. We will need some proof to stand with this. There is 3 reasons why this is just a natural landform. They can just be like any landform on earth, a face like this can happen anywhere else, and if you believe in aliens are they really capable of doing something like this?\n \n The first reason why this is just a natural landform is because it can also happen on earth. For example, this can happen upon natural sources. Such eratation and it can just be a mesa. Another example is, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough round Cydonia\"(2). If this is common than most likely it wouldn't be made by any alien. My last example for this is, most landforms have ways it can look. The landforms can happen anywhere and that wouldnt mean it was caused by an alien. If something like this happened on earth most people would think it was caused by natural thigs like the weather.\n \n My second reason is that things can happen anywhere. For example, another planet my have this but that doesnt mean an alien went and left it there so we could find it. If an alien did this we would be able to find something almost the same as this face. Another example is, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars\"(5). This can be true but if it was an alien wouldnt they do a face they new or reconized. Lastly, in the passage it states that \"There was no alien monument after all\". The picture clearly showed a landform not an alien made monument. In conclusion, things like this can happen in different forms but nobody has proven it was made by an alien.\n \n My last reason for why this is not an alien made monument is because there is no proof that aliens made it. For example, have aliens been proven to exist. No proof was every made that aliens exist in the planet mars. Secondly, how could they build such a thing. if aliens built it than there must be a great amount of them that we did not know about. Lastly, if aliens aready built a Face on Mars why can't they do the same thing on Earth. there is no explanation of they wouldn't be able to do this. In order for the aliens to make something like this that would mean they are capable of this and more but they still haven't been proven to exist.\n \n In conclusion, the face could have been made by something other than aliens. The three reasons explaining why it couldn't have been aliens is it could have been done by nature, it can happen somewhere else, and are aliens capable of this. This can prove that aliens didnt build it, that it could have been made by different things.",

    ESSAY: "The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.\n \n There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.\n \n If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.\n \n They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.\n \n While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.",

    ESSAY: "I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform. It may look like a face but it is really not. What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away. So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad. It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.",

As a scientist we are constantly getting information from people about their thoughts on the Face on Mars. We get many suggestions, such as the face being created by aliens. Well as a scientist I'm here to tell you it was not created by aliens.\n \n This face on Mars was not created by aliens, but was created by nature itself. The Face on Mars is a natural landform. I know this because as a scientist of NASA we believe this face is just a huge rock formation. This rock resembles a human head. The human head formed by shadows, giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and lastly a mouth. Many authors that have researched on this topic believe it will attract more attention to planet Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars has became a very big deal. It has played a role in movies, showed up in magazine articles, and has been a topic on radio talk shows. Many people have come to conclusion that NASA would rather hid information about this such thing. But NASA just wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\n \n Many people still believe that this artifact came for aliens, but few scientist and have come to believe this is true. NASA takes pictures of the Face on Mars but many aren't satisfied by the quality of the pictures. As a scientist at NASA it is very challenging to capture a good photo because this face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude. This means that the camera has to peer through many wispy clouds to catch the face.\n \n We scientist at NASA have come to conclusion that this Face on Mars isn't created by aliens because of those reasons. Although many others may disagree and believe NASA is hiding information on this artifact. As a scientist that works for NASA, we will continue to look more into this specific topic and hopefully be able to know for a fact that this is created by landform and not aliens.",

According to the text, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,\" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.\n \n Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said \"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars, is it really what NASA says it is? The Face on Mars is really what they say it is;a face on Mars. Most belivers in the alien world believe that aliens did do it, while most scientist do not. I am a scientist at NASA working on the \"project\" and most scientist believe that it was just a giant mesa or a \"mountain\" or something that was formed by natural effect.\n \n I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that. In April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia, for the first time ever, and snapped a very \"sharp\" picture of the \"site'.\n \n Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.\n \n The belivers in aliens were still not satiisfied on the image they had seen on the internet due to the weather that day. Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the \"reasearchers\" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.\n \n After they had gotten the second picture they \"blew it up\" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids. The picture acutally showed that it is the, Martian equivalent, size of a buttle or (a. k. a. a mesa) which are landforms most commonly made by nature in the American West.\n \n \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Gavin. \"Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n I hope this has convienced you to believe that the picture is real and that aliens did not build it and that the pictures and people that have spoken told you that it is just a natural landform that was created by \"mother-nature.",

There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.\n \n After studying the \"face\" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the \"face\" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the \"face\". There are many other theories of what the for may be.\n \n I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the \"alien head\" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the \"face\" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the \"face\" was real, but can you always trust magazines.

    ESSAY: "Twenty-five years ago a photo was taken of a natural landform that appears to look like a face. Many people will argue that it isn't a natural landform but, more of an alien artifact. While the two sides still don't see eye to eye they both have evidence that could support their belief.\n \n While, some people think that the face on Mars is \"bona-fide evidence\" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was \"important to the taxpayers\" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.\n \n So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.\n \n While NASA hasn't changed there opinion because it is in fact just a landform. Many people still want good proof that it could quite possibly be acient civilization. So, they prepared to send up another. This time they sent it up on a cloudless summer day so that no-one could argue that the weather affected the pictures. NASA was right again. This time they took up a camera that zoomed in the structure and it didn't show anything new that would have meant that there has ever been any life there.\n \n All together, these facts prove that it is just a landform. A scientist named Garvin was quoted saying \"That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The face is indeed just like a landform that we have here on Earth. Although the other side of this long running debate did have some evidence that might have made NASA think twice, there is still more proof that it is a landform.",

    ESSAY: "Face The Landform?\n \n Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.\n \n First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that \"face\" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.\n \n After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.\n \n Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.\n \n So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.",

    ESSAY: "In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the \"Face on Mars\". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.\n \n When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that \"the Face\" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that \"the Face\" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.\n \n Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture \"huge rock formation...\" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of \"the Face\". The articles states the the image was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\". This image proved that \"the Face\" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph \"on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look\". It also says \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says \"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West\". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.\n \n The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that \"the Face\" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars. Who knows?",

However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.\n \n First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.\n \n Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,\" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.\n \n Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,\" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Also, paragraph twelve states,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West.\" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.\n \n In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",

    ESSAY: "Mesa on Mars\n \n Who or what created this \"face\" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say \"the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This \"face\" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.\n \n To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it states, \"...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos.\" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...\" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.\n \n Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this \"face\" for what it is?\n \n Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars.\" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.\n \n Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the \"face\" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and \"sunny\". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been \"obducted by aliens\". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that \"scientists don't believe there is a chance of this\" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.\n \n All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa. All of these things proove that not only was \"the Face of Mars\" just a natural forming landform. Will you know the real cause of something like \"The Face of Mars\" next time you see one?",

But a big percentage of those people said it looked like an aliens face which was a Huge rock formation but they kept defending their statement. But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.\n \n Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so. The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement. On Mars there is that to, the only three things Mars dosen't have is oxygen, water, or any subtance of food or plants that make oxygen. The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars. The thing is that no one really could of created that without any food or water.\n \n I think after all the research NASA has done and the studying of the natural landform on Mars that was created by Rock Formation turns out to be ture and for evryone that thinks that me and my team at NASA are wrong well no i don't think i am wrong i think i am way beyond positive that we are right because NASA has done everything they can to bring the people the right information. The people that think the natural landform was created by alliens need to join NASA so they can come along see that NASA brings only the truth noting but the truth to the people. But NASA always trys to do there best to convince people to know the right information and to have the correct facts in hand.",

    ESSAY: "The face on Mars is just another fake thing happening in this world. Honestly it is just another natural landform. Scientist might have been shocked when they saw it back in 1976 but know they are understanding and learning that the face is just a natural landform.\n \n The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.\n \n Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.\n \n This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.\n \n This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.\n \n The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.\n \n Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.\n \n When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.\n \n This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.\n \n The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.\n \n Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.\n \n Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.\n \n Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.\n \n This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.\n \n If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face.\n \n The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Scientists made a discovery on Cydonia,a region on the Red Planet. NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of the area, looking for sites for its sister ship, Viking 2. While it began to take pictures of the region, it spotted a human-like face. Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.\n \n It has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos. There was no alien monument, only a natural landform. Finally, they gave up.\n \n After eighteen long years of investigation, many researchers gave up on the Face. Many natural landforms disappear over time which is why scientists and researchers can no longer find it. Although, some researchers are still on the look out for the Face, hoping to find it again soon.",

    ESSAY: "In 1976, Viking 1 took a picture of what looked to be a a human face on Mars. A few days later the picture was reviealed to the public eye, and it was starred in hollywood film movies, books, magazines, and talks shows. But in 2001, new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it was only a mesa. Though there are many credible reasons to believe that it was only a mesa, some people still believe that is an alien artifact.\n \n Yes, one might think that the mesa looks like a face from an egyptian Pharoh, but after closer examination, it was only a natural landform. We are able to prove this because on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Sureyor flew over for the first time, a picture was taken that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that showed only a natural landform. When the picture was unveiled to the public eye, it had a caption that told people it was a mesa that resembled a human face only because shadows that were on the rock gave an opticl illusion of eye,nose, and mouth. Also on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enogh for a second look and used the cameras absolute maximum resolution to take an even better picture that again showed that it was only a mesa. From these pictures alone you can tell that there wasn't a face on Mars and that there isn't any extraterrestial beings living on Mars.\n \n in conclusion, the \"face\" on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform that you can probably see on Earth. Also if there were to actually be life on Mars, it would be a major break through that would help better fund NASA, so what would be the piont in trying to hide it from the public that funds our research?

    ESSAY: "So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?\" the man asked. \"I'm not buying it.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" I replied, \"and I'm about to show you why I'm right.\"\n \n The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, \"I'm all ears.\"\n \n The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\".\n \n To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the \"face\" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.\n \n \"Whatever, geek!

This figure is probably a fake because how often do you go to a planet and just find a random rock that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up.

It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.\n \n First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This \"alien created object\" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?\n \n Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.\n \n Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this \"plain\" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.\n \n It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.\n \n Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this.

    ESSAY: "Face\" the Facts\n \n The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the \"truth\" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the \"Face on Mars\" is nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" it says \"...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.\n \n Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.\n \n Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.\n \n To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to\n \n In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.\n \n - E.M.",

NASA has sent numerous things into space but one in specific has caused a great deal of curiosity through out the world. In 1976, a NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, took pictures of Mars and something unusual happened. A face apeared in a picture. At first NASA thought of the possibility of it being a foreign life form. But that possibility was stopped when scientists found out that it was just another Martian Mesa. A common landform on Mars. When the pictures were released to the public, many thought that NASA was lying, especially conspiracy theorists. They thought that NASA didn't want the public to know about an alien life form. That was very irrational.\n \n Many people don't like the idea of space exploration because they say it's a waste of money. If NASA encountered foreign life forms, it would only be benefitial to tell the public because then NASA would gain popolarity and skeptism of the program would decrease. Many people would be curios about it and would want to know more about the race. Therefore NASA would have a better reputation and be more popular because of their discovery.\n \n Secondly,technology has changed significantly since 1978. The original picture looks more like the face than any other one because of the old technology. In 1998, the picture looks more detailed. In 2001, it looks even more detailed. In 1976 the camera that took the photo only captured 43 meters per pixel making it much less definated compared to the picture taken in 2001 that captured 1.56 meters per pixel. This technology makes it less of a face.\n \n Finally, because of the newer and more advanced technology, NASA's scientists could look further in to the so called alien face. After studying it, the scientists concluded that the \"face\" was a mesa. A mesa isnt't only found on Mars. It can also be found on Earth. There is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it even has the same height as the Face on Mars. The \"face\" is more of a natural landform than anything.\n \n New technoogy, comparable lndforms, and the explanation of how alien races would benefit NASA helped the space program prove conspiricy theorists and the public wrong. All of these supports are hard evidence that the face was a mesa in disguise. Although the finding of an alien race would be revolutionary, it's safe to say that the \"face\" isn't the discovery of one. We'll just have to wait until the future to encounter a race that isn't our own.",

    ESSAY: "Since we had sent surveyors to Mars we have found many interesting things. We learned about much of the landscapes there and compared them to what we have here. Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa biom. The face in the area of Mars know as Cydonia is a mesa biom, so natural formations accur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa biom.\n \n The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not a alien structure. As it said in the article, \"Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact.\" They are the ones that truely study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique stucture that was naturaly created.\n \n The second reason is that the first image was burry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were cearer and prooved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.\n \n The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa biom. Things like this form all the time and should not be thought of a being made by anything other than nature. Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to accur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.\n \n There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa biom so this is natural.",

    ESSAY: "As a scientist at NASA I strongly believe that the \"The Face on Mars\" is simply a martian from of a mesa, which is commonly found on Cydonia. According to the text \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This was of course after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydonia and captured a higher resolution image of \"The Face.\" In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.\n \n Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.\n \n In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon \"Mars martian face\" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere. There was no need for all the chaos and random conspiracy theories, all it need was a little bit of science and hard work.",

On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.\n \n First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the \"facial features\" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.\n \n Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.\n \n Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the \"face\". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.\n \n In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point.

    ESSAY: "I can see why you can think that \"the Face on Mars\" is some form of proof that either alien life did at one time or is still cuurrently on Mars . The human mind is meant to think, imagine and wonder \"what if\". Let's say these \"aliens\" are in fact real and constructed \"the Face\" in order to communicate with us. Carving a giant face has got to be one of if not thee least effective way of dong so.\n \n These \"aliens\" very well could have simply just put a peice of shiney metal on the surface and the MGS would have seen it and we would probaly think \"hey, this unknown element is here on the surface of a planet where there are no metals\". Not only would it make us think that there is indeed metals on Mars but then we would think \"hey metals most usually form deep undergroud so there is no reason for this to be on the surface\". THAT would be a valid way of letting us know \"hey, we exist\".\n \n Also another thing, if \"aliens\" made \"the Face\" how is it no footprint s were found. And there's no wind on Mars they coulnt have blown away. Seriusly, that's a big project so you're gonna need a lot of your alien buddies to help you out with it and no footprints....hmm. Well hey,maybe they have got giant eagle wings and fly everywhere. Yeah, on a planet that HAS NO GRAVITY!\n \n Let's face it though (ha, face, get it?) everybody loves a good \"supernatural \" story. I believe that this is nothing more. \"Once in 1976 a NASA spacecraft was looking for a place to land, and there on the surface they found... a huge human's face carved out of the surface Mount Rushmore style....wooouuh\"\n \n In conclusion, The very thought that \"aliens\" somehow carved a face onto Mars is ridiculis . And the final nail in the coffin? When you hear \"conspiricy theorist\" you think of a frail, usually middle aged, pale becuase he hasn't stepped out of his trailer in weeks, guy with a aluminum cone on his head and always taling about how\"The Man\" is out to get him.\n \n Also he is dirty becuase hasnt shaved or showered in like a year.

When NASA unveilde the picture for everyone to see they specificly said in the caption that it was a huge rock formation that resembled a humans face, but because of the shadows it gave the illusion of a human face because of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Which is not really possible for the people to believe that Aliens had created this because of all the pictures that where taken there was no picture with a alien life form. Another reason for this is that you can see things in the digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. That way if there were other objects on Mars than you would be able to see that they were.

    ESSAY: "Many people still believe that the Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it's to hard to really know what the object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.\n \n Based on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn't mean it is that.\n \n Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west.\" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.\n \n The first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, \"the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze.\" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.\n \n Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, \"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.\n \n Based on research, and facts from, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't.",

    ESSAY: "The Face on Mars\"\n \n On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.\n \n Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.\n \n The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA\"s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.\n \n In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",

NASA was confident that it was a formation as well after posting it on their website they captioned \" A huge rock formation\" this shows that the majority of NASA believe this as well.

Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.\n \n Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars. Usually the crafts land on 3 or more legs. The craft could have possibly marked a dust mound. Wind three or more legs, you could form the face on Mars' surface.\n \n What NASA needs to do is send more crafts and robots.

    ESSAY: "The face is just a natural landform and not evidence of an alien attack. There are many reasons why this landform is only natural and not any type of alien proof. One of those is that if NASA found a secret alien civiilization they would tell us because it would help increase their budget. Another reason that it's just a natural landform is because it is just like some other natural landforms on Earth and other mesa's on Mars. The last reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that NASA is scietifically trained and would know if it was proof of alien's existence but the conspiracy theorists aren't scientifically trained and would be less likely to know exactly what it is.\n \n The first reason that it's just a natural landform is that NASA would tell us if it was proof of an alien attack. It states in the text that \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" which shows how it would help increase their budget. Since the Face is so popular and has even become a pop icon if NASA were to find out it was proof of an alien attack they would most likely tell us because since it is so popular it would give them a significant increase to their budget. That is just one of the three reasons that I will b talking about in this essay.\n \n The second reason that the Face is just a natural landform is because it is just like other landforms on Earth and around that area on mars. In the article it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West\". That passage from the article shows that there are landforms on Earth that look similar to that one on Mars so it couldn't be proof of an alien attack. The article also says \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh\". That shows that other landforms that resemble the Face on that part of Mars isn't uncommon. The only thing that made the Face stand out from other landforms was the shadows which made it appear to have a face that looked like an egyptian pharoah.\n \n The third and final reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that the scientists would know better than any of the conspiracy theorists would so we should believe them. NASA has no reason to hide the Face from us because even if it was an alien attack, as I stated in paragraph two, it would help increase their budget. Other conspiracy theorists believe NASA is just trying to hide the proof of an alien attack but if that was what they were doing, they wouldn't have released a picture of the Face at all. Also when NASA realeased a new high resolution image in 2001 and a 3D altimetry of the Face, the landform no longer reseambled a face, which is proof that it is just a mesa.\n \n Those 3 reasons are the reasons you should believe scientists and not think it is an alien landform. NASA has nothing to hide since it would increase their budget. They also are more trained in knowing what landforms on mars are than any conpiracy theorists are. The other reason is because there are many other landforms on Earth that resemble faces which could be compared to the Face. Those 3 reasons are why we should all stop trying to make conspiracy theories and just believe what NASA is trying to tell us, that it's just a mesa.",

    ESSAY: "Long ago, Vikings spotted a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. It was about two miles long and was located on a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some people are convinced that aliens on the Red Planet, but others would beg to differ. Most scientists agree that aliens are just a myth and they did not build the \"face. Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he \"face.\"\n \n For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the \"face\" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this \"face\" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face.\" Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.\n \n Still not satisfied with my argument? If not, listen to this. With all of the new technology these days, there is even more proof as to why there was no aliens who built the \"face.\" A camera took photos of the \"face\" with maximum resolution. With the high technology cameras, scientists could look at the photo three times as large as the origianl snapshot. Becasue the scientists can zoom in so much, they would have been able to see if there were any aliens on the planet. The picture actually shows Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, which are llandforms commonly located around American West.\n \n Most scientists would agree that there never was alien life on Cydonia. Thanks to technology, this point can be proven even further. Obviously, aliens did not build the \"face\" that is on the Red Planet.",

    ESSAY: "Do you believe in aliens? In 1976 the Viking 1 spacecraft of NASA discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face! Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.\n \n The first reason why this \"face\" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.\n \n Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\n \n However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.\n \n So in conclusion the \"face\" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.",

Proving that the so called \"human face made by aliens\" was not only unrealistic but also doubting Nasa, who has been in work since the first time the United states landed on the moon. Reason two, why would you be doubting a group when they have been working on new technoligy for modern space traveling for a long time. Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the \"human Face\". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do. Nasa even had qualified scientists to make sure it was't an alien face and even confirmed it. The third reason is because on April 5, 1998 when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped pictures ten times sharper and confirmed it was just a natural landform. Once again in April 8, 2001 Nasa proved that it was not a an alien sculpture once again.

    Essay: "Twenty five years ago a sacecraft valled Viking 1 from NASA took a picture of what looked like a human face. Eighteen years later Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of it that was ten times larger than the last one. This photograph showed that it was nothing more than a natural land form. Some people thought that it looked this way because of clouds. Finaly in 2001 Mars Global Surveyor took a second shot at it with a much better resalution. This one also suggests that it is nothing more than a landform. Some people still think this was made by aliens despite all of the evidence going against it. I think that it is just a landform because, aliens wouldn't know what humans looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other things it could be.\n \n My first reason is that aliens would not know what humans look like. If you think about it animals on earth don't look like humans so aliens wouldn't look like that either. Mars also has really bad conditions for life like us to survive. Plus aliens woul probably look even more different than animals because they evolved on a whole other planet. It is even more unlikely that they would just guess what we look like.\n \n Another reason is that it isn't that crazy of a coincidence. A human face is only two dots with a dot centeered under neath them and a line under it. and this doesn't even have a very distinctive nose so its just two dots and a line. Its like when you look at the clouds and see what looks like animals or other familiar things. You know aliens didn't put those there.\n \n My last reason is that there are plenty of other things this could be. It could just be some sort of landform. Espescially in the last picture you can see lines it it resembling something that was made naturally. It is kind of like a butte or messa on earth only this is on mars. This is most likely made naturally.\n \n The chances that this was made by aliens is incredibly low. The first picture however, does closely resemble a human's face. The problem is that with each picture it looks les and less like a human face. Also the last picture was taken on a cloudless summer day. I dont think this was built by aliens because, aliens wouldn't know what we looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other explanations.",

    Essay: "The disputes about the Face being an alien creation rather than a landform are preposterous. Alien life is a common conspirasy theory, but this one proves just that: a theory. The Face cannot possibly be an alien creation because there is no evidence of alien life ever existing, the landform it is compared to on Earth was certainly not created by aliens, and scientists have extensively studied it to prove that it is, indeed, a natural landform.\n \n For starters, in order for the aliens to create this two-mile long \"face\", dimensioned straight from NASA, they must first exist. Unfortunately for the pro-alien believers, this has never been proven. Some say that NASA is keeping this monumental secret from us, but, as thoughtfully pointed out in the article, the existance of ancient alien life would benefit them immensely. In this case, there is no reason for them to hide anything.\n \n Another thing worth mentioning is the strong resemblance to the landforms found right here in the United States. These mesas are common in the American West, says chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. There is no reason that they can't be common on the Red Planet, either. The article states that in Cydonia, the region where the Face is located is actually known to have mesas scattered frequently around the area. Unless Earth's mesas, too, were crafted by aliens, they both must be natural landforms.\n \n The Face has been a topic of conversation since it was first photographed in 1976. When NASA first released the picture to the public, the caption stated: \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Then, after extensive research to prove that it was actually not an alien creation of sorts, NASA determined that the shadows were, indeed, the cause of the shapes of the Face. It was even photographed numerous times to prove this fact, and because they felt it was important to taxpayers, as the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program noted.\n \n Skeptics of the Face might say that it is all a well thought out trick to hide alien life ffrom the general public. However, as previously mentioned, NASA would benefit if this ancient civilization was real. Therefore, there is no logical reason they would keep this from us. The article states that when the very first picture of the Face was released: \"the authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" This shows us that they are wanting people to be interested, which would be much easier if there was an alien or two to report, but there is clearly not.\n \n The landform labeled the Face is certainly an intriguing discovery, but not for the fact it was an acient alien monument. It is interesting because it connects us with the Red Planet considering we have landforms similar to it, and also the expert study that has gone into it to prove the suspicions incorrect.",

    Essay: "In the year of 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft found a face looking figure staring back at the cameras. A lot of people have conspiracy theories that the aliens caused this. Though, anyone with a decent amount of knowledge in astronomy and even geology, will know that this is simply a mesa of some sort.\n \n With a lot of people and few scientists still believing that the Face was some type of alien creration or artifact, it became a priority for NASA when the MSG arrived to Mars. The MGS was ready to fly over Cydonia to have a better look and get a better picture of the Face. As they were flying over the Face, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the previous pictures taken by the Viking 1 spacecraft. The pictures were released and all the people eager to see the pictures and everyone from NASA saw that it was nothing but a natural landform.\n \n Though, people and few scientists weren't ready to give up on their opinion. When they looked at the pictures they claimed that the time the picture was taken was a cloudy time. They believed that the clouds affected the quality of the picture. They also said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the haze.\n \n So NASA reacted to these skeptical claims. On April 8, 2001, On a clear day with no clouds, the MGS was ready for a second investigation of the Face. The MGS rolled 25 degrees to the center of the Face. The picture was amazing using the camera's maximum resolution. The pixels from the image from 2001 spans 1.56, while the viking's best photo had 43 meters per pixel. The picture was so amazing that if there was some objects like landed plains or small shacks you could see what they were.\n \n The Face was an amazing discovery, though some people got carried away thinking it was created by aliens. Though those conspiracy theories were invalid, it doesn't take away the merit from NASA findind this amazing landform on mars and taking high quality pictures. You never know, people might even be able to experience the Face from an even closer look!",

    Essay: "There has been a large argument about the \"Face on Mars\". This \"Face on Mars\" is located in a region called Cydonia, where martian mesas are commmon. It has gain a lot of attention from conspiracy theorist that belive there is life on Mars, and they belive an alien life form has created the face. While scientist are positive, that this is a natural landform like you see on Earth. However, conspiracy theorists ignore what the scientists say.\n \n If aliens had created a monument that looked like humans, how would they know what we look like in the first place? We have not seen or proven that there is life on Mars, and if they knew what we looked like, wouldn't we know what they look like? Many conpsiracy theriosts argue that NASA wants to keep aliens a secret, but NASA would love to find an ancient civilization on Mars. If they could find an ancient civilization that could be a break through in science and biology.\n \n When they took another picture in April 1998, the picture was taken with clouds in the sky, making it impossible to see the small things. The theriosts argue that they couldn't see anything, so on April 8, 2001 they took another picture. It was a cloudless day in the Cydonia region. They took aother picture of the phenomeun in full resolution, and that picture proves that the face is just a mesa or butte. The landform was even common in the United States.\n \n Many conspiracy theorists was wishing for this to be a momunment from an anicent civilization, but the facts are agaist it. In the high resolution picture you can see the crevices in the land that make up the lanform. With the ditches and holes in the land, it causes shadows that reemble the eyes, nose, and mouth of a human. NASA would be happy to find an ancient civilization on Mars, but they look to the information first.",

The evidence that proves this is true is there is another landform just like it on Earth and there are detailed pictures that show it is just a natural landform.\n \n The first evidence that shows it is just a landform is the fact that there is another natural landform like that on Earth. The picture shows an equivalent to a butte or messa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. The text says, \"'It reminds me of the most Middle Butte in the Snake Plain of Idaho,'...about the same height as the Face on Mars.'\"\n \n This quote is giving a clear example of someone saying that the Face is like a natural landform on Earth. If it is like something that is made on Earth naturally, that means it could probably made naturally on Mars too. There is another great piece of evidence showing that it is a natrual landform.\n \n Another piece of evidence that proves the Face is a natural landform is that there are detailed pictures that show it is all natural. In 2001 NASA could take pictures with each pixel thats spans 1.56 metes, which is very detailed for the technology we have. The text says, \"'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'\" This example goes to show that NASA took a picture using the best resolution they had on their cameras to show and see the fact that it is not alien made and is all naturally made.\n \n Many people believe the Face on Mars is made by aliens but that is not true at all. The Face is just a natural landform.

NASA leaked the photo, then people, including scientist and astronomers,started to wonder if it were created by aliens!\n \n I disagree,I do not think the face was created by aliens, and there are various reasaons. I do not think the face was created by aliens and I am going to explain why,a face can`t be created by aliens unless it were remains,scientist would have already discovered aliens before the face if it were to be created by aliens, and NASA revealed the face as 2 miles long,it couldn`t be created by aliens.\n \n The face on Mars couldn`t have been created by aliens,how can a face be created by aliens, unless it were alien remains? If it were alien remains,that means aliens would have to exist. Scientist have not found aliens or alien remains to this day. A sharper picture of the face proved it wasn`t created by aliens, mentioned in paragraph 7. Besides, aliens can`t create a face.\n \n If it were to be created by aliens we would have discovered aliens before we found this huge face. Space rovers have been searching the planet mars before the face was found. The face is two miles long according to paragraph one,it would take some time to build it. We would have found aliens building it before we found the face itself. Thus, the face is a natural landform.\n \n The face is two miles long, if it were aliens existing, they would not be able to build something like this. An alien wouldn`t create a two mile landform if it exsited. It would not be a reason to, there would be no benificiary reason for an alien to build a face. It was also discovered as a natural landform. It couldn`t possibly be created by aliens.\n \n In conclusion, I do not think the two mile landform was created by aliens. The only way it would be alien related is if it were alien remains. If it were created by aliens, we would have discovered them already. Since the landform is two miles long,it would take some time if it were to be build. Besides,it`s two miles long, there is no benificiary reason for an alien to spend this much time on a landform, it couldn`t possibly be created by aliens. This is why I dont believe that the face on Mars, was created by aliens.",

    Essay: "Imagine going to outer space, and you land on Mars. When you get there you find a landform that you haven't seen before. This could be something big, but you know it isn't alive, so you have to assume it is a landform. When you go back and show everyone what you found people think it is an alien, but further investigations show it is a natural landform. This Face is a natural landform because no one has ever seen something like this before, no one has any proof that it is a human or alien, and NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor say it is a landform.\n \n First of all, no one has seen anything like this before. The text states,\" There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors.\" This peice of evidence shows that the face is new to them, and they don't know what it is. Another piece of evidence is,\" Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars.\" This, also, shows that NASA doesn't know what it is. If no one knows what it is then you can't say it is a human or alien without knowing the facts.\n \n Secondly, no one has any proof that it could be an alien or a human. For instance, the text states,\" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.\" This piece of evidence shows that they can't figure out exactly what the face is. They are making aussumtions of what the face might be, but they aren't one-hundred percent sure of what it is. NASA would have to have proof to say it is an alien or not.\n \n Lastly, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet he found out the face was a natural landform. For example, the text states,\" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.\" This shows that once they got a clear picture of the face, the JPL found out it was just an ordinary landform. The text also states,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" This piece of evidence found in the text shows that NASA figured out that the face was a landform. Yes, the face did look like a human, but the NASA found out it was a landform when they closely examined the it.\n \n In conclusion, the face that was thought to be an alien or a human was clearly a natural landform. First of all, it was never seen before, so no one could be sure of what it was. Secondly, people just assumed it was an alien or a human, and they had no proof that it was. Lastly, the Mars Global Surveyor found out the face was a natural landform. This evidence shows that face everyone thought was an alien was actually a natural landform.",

There has also been arguments over the years if \"the face\" was created by aliens or was it just a natural landform. Here is why I belive it is a natural landform.\n \n In the article \"Umasking the Face on Mars, in paragraph 12 it says what the picture that the picture actually shows that the Martian is equaivalent to a butte or messa which are landforms common around the American West. Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion. Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,\" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.\n \n Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.\n \n In conclusion, I belive that \"The Face\" was a just a natural landform. I belive this because of the eveidence that NASA provided and the fact that they went back to space and took anthor picture with up to date technology.",

    Essay: "Is there a face is on Mars? I would say no, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact. There are shadows that can make it seem like a face ,but shadows can alter thing appearnces. April 5th, 1998, and April 8th 2001 have clearer images that can prove that prove that it is also not alien. Unlike the photos of the Viking 1 in 1976 ,which were older and were less clear. So the Face is not real because of, the later more clearer images prove that it is not, and shadows can alter one's apperance.\n \n First off, the Face on the isn't a face it is a rock on Mars, that had shaows that made it look like face. People and imgaes can come about blurry ,and may looklike something else. Also pixels also can help make things seem like they are not what the they are. Like the picture in April 8th, 2001 pixels made it look clearer. A compasrion can be shared of the 1976 picture to the 2001 picture, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\"(10). There is comparaion toeach photo that was taken and as time went on it got clearer and showed less of a face. Which makes it more of reason it is not an ailean artifact.\n \n Next, on April 5th ,1998 after the 1976 Viking picture of the face on Mars became a hit. NASA wanted to go take another picture ,because people keppsying it was made by aliens,it was difficult though. After NASA had gotten the photo though,it was more clear, which again proves that it is not an alien artifact. Even in the passage it states about it ,\"Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tne times sharper than the origianl Viking photos\"(7). After that it was on the web people realized that it is a land form not a alien structure. So it is a fact that it is not an alien artifact.\n \n Finally, On april 8th ,2001, people still were blieving that alien made the landform. So NASA snapped another picture, in the passage it states \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view\"(10). This mean they had gotten a good angle on the Face. And the picture was more clearer again. They had proven to the world that the Face was not alien. It was a landform.\n \n My oppionent might state to me though that we did not see the real deal on screen just with a picture. They could of had edited it to make not alien. That is true but in 2001 they didn't have good editing system unlike we do today. So that image can not be really edited.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is not alien the images of April 8th, 2001 and April 5th, 1998 can prove this. Also there are not editing system theat were really good to photo shop back then, and it had been proven many times by NASA that it is not.",

Some people think that the Face was created by aliens even though there has been many tests and agreements that it is just a natural landform. I belive that it is a natural landform beacuse there is proof that scientists have figured it was just another Martian mesa, there are pictures that proves it could just be formed like that because it is common around Cydonia, and there has not yet been any proof to encourage it was created by aliens.\n \n The scientists and I have done several researches ever since we first saw the Face. Everything has yet led to prooving it is just another Martian mesa. Looking through all the pictures, everything stated that it is just a huge rock formation. The rock resembles a human head with eyes, a mouth, and a nose. I believe that after all the temperatures such as the heat and coldness, it could have caused it to be shaped like that. There has probably even been spaceships that has landed in Mars in search of investigation. The spaceships could have formed these shapes when landing there.\n \n As you probably know, it is very common around Cydonia to have these kind of natural landfoms. Yes, it is common to have shapes and forms that are unusual such as the Face. The only difference in this one was that it had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Theres not really much of a difference if you think about it. It is unbelievable that it's the first time poeple think of an alien doing this art work when they have never thought of this idea when we have found other evidence of natural lanforms like the Face.\n \n There has been plenty of evidence to proove that the Face is just a natural landform, but there is no proove of it to be created by aliens. Looking at the pictures closely, there are no footprints, fingerprints, or marks to show any living life in Mars. If theres no living life in Mars, then how could there be aliens?

I have been getting many claims of it being a monument built by ancient life on Mars. Believe us, here at NASA we would love for the claims of alien life to be true, but we've been given substantial information that those claims are incorrect. There are many reasons why these claims are invalid. First of all, landforms like the so-called face appear on our home planet it would be easy to find; secondly the appearance of a face was given merely by the casting of shadows over the surface over the red plant; and lastly, the intensely zoomed in picture showed no sign of anything that would hint at any type of civilization.\n \n Here on Earth, we have tons of natural landforms created by erosion, glaciers, and the sea. The landform on Mars appears to be a mesa, a landform that happens to be very common in the western area of America. The climate of Mars can be quite similar to that of the West, and that hints to us that because of the hot climate that usually occurs with the sun shining on Mars, this landmark has formed only because of the climate and conditions of the area. It is a reasonable idea to consider and should be proof enough, but there are still some sceptics so I will continue.\n \n Some may say, even if it was a natural landform, how on Earth does it look exactly like a human face? Well first of all, people see what they wish to see. They think it's a face because it is such a fascinating and fantastic thing to think of. \"A human face on Mars?! No way!\" The landform isn't actually shaped like a face, it is merely the shadows that are cast on it that cause the appearance of it being a face. However, upon closer inspection by NASA the landform was revealed merely to be a completely normal patch of land, nothing special at all.\n \n If all of what I'm saying isn't enough to convince you, I have got one more important point to make. NASA has gone to extensive lengths to examine this landform that has caused such a big fuss among the people. In the April of 2008, scientists set out to explore the face of Mars once more. It was an apparently cloudless day and it was that day that they took the picture. The picture was zoomed in as far as it could have been, so that anything on the face of the planet could be seen. There weren't any signs of life, no tents where extra-terrestrial life would sleep and no proof of anything building this landform.\n \n To sum all of this up, there is simply just no way that this landform could have been built by alien life. There are too many facts and too much research done on this landform, we know all there is to know and what we can say for sure is, there is simply no way the Face was createed by Aliens. You'll just have to face the facts and wonder how on earth this picture managed to look exactly like a human face. The mystery was fun while it lasted, but now that we have the facts, it is time to lay this case to rest.",

    Essay: "Do you believe in aliens? If so do you believe them living in outer space or perhaps on a different planet? Imagine if you worked for NASA and you found pictures about an \"Unmasking face on Mars\". What would you do or even think about if you had seen faces on the surface of Mars?\n \n I work for NASA and I have have found pictures about a face on Mars and through my perpectives I believe that its an alien on the surface on Mars. The reason why I believe this is an alien because the face is an absolute landform of an alien. These photos were taken 1976, 1998 and 2001. In 2001 the face evolted more like a face of what humans it was of humans but I've been doing research that these faces are from aliens.\n \n Although it does look like a human face theres no body connected to it unless the body is stuck underneath the surface of the planet, but through my research I insist it's an alien. I do not have proof it is one but theres no proof of it being a human either. When the Mars Orbiter Camera went around Mars the face still had no evidence if it was either a human face or an alien artifact.\n \n In my case I still prove this to be an alien. We've done plenty of research and nothing has been found is it is a human face or an alien. My question is if that it was a human why wouldn't have we known it was a human if it died. Where'd the rest of their body go? Perhaps it was trapped under the surface but in no question I still believe this is an artifact of an alien.",

Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority says, says the article.\n \n Don't get me wrong I do think that it is just a normal landfrom but, if you really look at it then it actually isnt a regular landfrom. To me it looks like the shadows on mars are creeping up on the mass of rock or sand or whatever it is. Like the scientists said the creeping up shadows is what gave the landform a the eyes the mouth and the nose.\n \n But, this face they say is actually called a mesa. From all the years it has went through such as 1976 to 2001 I would say that the face is now older and deformed. The article says what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.\"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Gavin. They also says it's not easy to target Cynodia.\n \n So when people say that the face is an actual face they are wrong becaus e if they would actually read a article on the mesa/face . They would see that they are not right at all they are just wrong. Beacus ethe shadows are what gave the massive the landform the eyes and the mouth and the nose.

    Essay: "There are many questions about the mystery of the \"Face on Mars.\" The article states that the picture of the Face is \" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" More information about the \"Face on Mars\" is in the following statements.\n \n It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.\n \n NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a \"good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.\n \n Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not.

    Essay: "Gerald was one of the scientists that led the investigation on the Face. He had been to college already, so he has been very experienced with these types of scenarios. He used NASA's Viking 1, and saw an object that appeared to be a face. He got a closer look later in his career, and it was not an actual face. This was later taken by surprise by the general public, and they still thought that it had to be a real sign of life on Mars. Because of this research, I believe that the face is just a natural landform. Three reasons why I believe this is true are that NASA's research has proven this, photographs taken by NASA have shown that this is true, and comparisons to landforms on Earth have shown the public that this is the truth.\n \n My first reason for stating my opinion would be that NASA's research has proven that the Face is a landform. An example of this from the text would be that NASA has published many photos of the Face to show the public that it was just a landform. To further explain this, if you look close enough at the pictures in this passage, then you can see it is a landform. It may look like a face from a far distance, but evidence given by NASA has shown that this is not the case.\n \n My second reason for this is the fact that NASA has taken many photographs of this landform to prove it is true. Here is a quote from the text that shows this: \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" Later in this paragraph, it states that the picture has proven that there was not an alien monument. Secondly, as people stated, it was a cloudy day in Mars, so they were not satisfied with the picture. So, \"On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Later in the paragraph, Garvin, an expert that works with NASA, says this: \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Even though it wasn't cloudy, the team of NASA got the same result: it is just a landform.\n \n My last reason would be that comparisons to landforms on Earth have proven that this is true. Garvin says in paragraph twelve that \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" What this is saying is that there have been similar landforms on Earth that are on Mars. Scientists can use this data to compare different pieces of landforms on different planets. Using this, they can figure out what the Face actually is, and other mysteries that they come up against.\n \n Some people may have used to say that the picture was too blurry to make out what the Face actually was. However, NASA has taken many clear photos of the Face, and they have proven several times that it is not an alien artifact, and that it is only a landform on the surface of the planet.\n \n So, what do you think now? Do you still believe that the Face is an ancient artifact? Well, you should not anymore after reading this; the evidence given here in this essay clearly shows that the Face is just a landform. Scientists like Gerald and Garvin have shown this a repeated amount of times. So, in conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, and not proof of life on Mars.",

Day's at the Lab went by as any other day for the scientist's, not finding anything new up in space, just a few minor event's here and there, but nothing big. I went in my office, and was informed today we were going to try and find any possible landing site's for Viking 1's sister ship, Viking 2. As usual we went to work. Orbiting Mars for what seemed like an eternity! I'm literally bored out of my mind, until out of the corner of my eye I see something, not just a star or anything, but to my eyes looked like a human face staring right back at us through Viking 1.\n \n Confusion is all us scientist's felt when we saw that face on Mars, just plain fear and confusion. Nothing was spoken much about it among us scientist's since we were all super shocked and speechless, that was until we were on our lunch break. All I heard was \"Alien's\", really alien's can they possibly pin this \"face\" on Aliens! The table next to me also seemed to think alien's made this Egyptian-type face. I dont know what came over me something just clicked and I said \"How can you possibly pin this on alien's?!\" of course this started a one-on-one argument with me and another scientist \"What do you mean, how can it not be Alien's\" he answered. \"First of all, it was spotted near Cydonia, a part of Mars where Martian Mesa's are commonly being found everyday, so how do we not know it isn't just another Mesa?\" \"If you think this is a mesa, how would it take form to look like a human being's face? Dont you think that is too much of a coincidence to happen?!\" at that I left it alone, maybe it was too much of a coincidence, but that wasn't going to affect my thought on the \"Mesa\"\n \n The word on the \"Face\" spreaded around the world, becoming a hot topic for people everywhere, most of them thinking it was made by Alien's. I didnt really get much into it until that scientist kid came up to me again, \"Still think it wasn't made by alien's?!\" \"Of course, why wouldn't I?\" \"How can you not think it was alien's! The picture became known to the world and everyone think's it was alien's, which they are probably right!!\" \"How can we know for sure this was created by alien's!? Think about it we dont have great technology yet, that \"Mesa\" was in the form of a face because our photo was too blurry and it was really cloudy!!\" I really didnt want to end up on the wrong foot with this guy so i just walked away.\n \n April 5,1998- I walk into the office and apparently we are going to take a look at Cydonia for the \"Face\" again. This was actually a releif to me, because I know that now our technology is way more advanced and we could see with a sharper picture what this thing really is, a mesa. So it happened Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took a picture ten time's sharper than the old one! As to my conclusion, the egyptian face ended up to be a mesa! This mesa took form of a face because of the shadow's that went over the mesa.

People have questioned \"Was it created by aliens?\" So many people believe that it was indeed created by aliens. I believe that it is just a natural landform and it just so happened to look like a human face, for these many reasons.\n \n In the article \"Unmasking Face on Mars\" it states that many people believe that this is not just a landform, it is some kind of alien creation. But, i can tell you otherwise. In stanza 3 it says, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It clearly says,\"formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" That can give you an image of how the shadows could have formed this face like creation.\n \n Another reason for this not being an alien cretaion as it states in stanza 7 of this article,\"thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"This is a great reason for people to realize that it is not an alien creation.

    Essay: "In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The \"Head\" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.\n \n The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was \"Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth.\" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.\n \n This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.\n \n Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.\n \n While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.\n \n Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.\n \n They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.\"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were\" Said Jim Garvin.\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. \"It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" Says Garvin. \"Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars.\" He added. So weather or not theFace is an alien landform or a rock formation, NASA does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupiclatiy to the Red Planet. However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive.",

To my personal vision the face is still sorte of developing, or the picture is really blury. Although it's developing or blury you can still seea face. NASA claim's for it to look or be visualized as a viking. These face's do look like natural landforf's.\n \n They look like wind or a storm formed them. In face one it look's like there is alot of wind when NASA took the picture. In face two it kinda revels a little more . What im thinking is there had to have been a storm or strong wind for face one to be so blury.\n \n These face's seem as if they had alot of time to form. Can that mean there natural.\n \n Think about this if these structure's were man made or alein made they wouldn't look like this so what is that telling us. Another reason is if it was man made it would be much smaller. These faces have to be natural landforms.

If it was man made this would not have happend they would have kept it clean.\n \n Although this is my oppinion many other's agree with what im am trying to argue.

That the face that they found was important to the taxpayers. I also found out that the face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it was winter in april, a cloudy time of year on the red planet.\n \n so my argumentative essay to the people that believe it was created by aliens well its not because when michael malin and his mars arbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, releaving a natural landform there were no aliens monument after all.",

From what i am seeing .Its seems that this face is an unusual face that no one have seen before. As far as the scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, Commom enough around Cydonia.\n \n A few days later . NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock formation . . . Which resembles a human Head . . . Formed by shadows gigivg the illusion of eyes , noes , and mouth\" The Authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract to mars.\n \n The \" Face on Mars\" has since become a pop icon . It has started in hollywood film , appeared in books, magaznines , radio talk shows--even huanted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars---evidence that NASA would rather hide , say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars.\n \n So on April 5, 1998, When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times Sharper than the orginal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\n \n So they all came together and thought about it . So there Now exchanging it all right .There trying to say that the picture from NAS is not the right picture which is so true . There trying to still the picture from somebody else which there trying to take the credit from mars which found the picture and put it all together . So now there all confused on which just happen when mars was just stating the simple facts that they found the oicture ands knows where the ou=ther one is and theere going to put it back together so they can have the right picture only if . NASA don try to come over welm them with a different picture which is going to throw them off topic and confuse then on which to do and what not to do because they came with the wrong information and mars had all the right information to which to out and how to put it all together and complete the big puzzle everybody been trying to out together because all alone they had it from the beging but was not sure it wass right nor positive and sure about that picture so when the NASA came to mars and try to prove them wrong on a nother level they out stood them, and made them think over so now NASA about to go back and try to discover the othere peices to the puzzle when its already solved they dont understand that they already have the puzzle figured out all along but now there trying to take what Mars had and say they found it first but not only that . But they have found something else which identify that that puzzle have been put together before the NASA found it . But its seems to me that the reader that MARS have found the puzzle face and put it together and now NASA is on envestigation once Again.",

    Essay: "The face on Mars is often a very controversial subject. People often think that NASA is hiding something about it from the entire world,and that is alien life. The idea that this is a real alien landform has been proven wrong and wrong again, so why do people still gravitate toward it?\n \n The poor quality cameras back in 1976 are nothing compared to the ones in 2001. There are photos of the landform from 2001 that make it look nothing like a face. The most recent photos have been taken on a cloud less day, with the resolution up as far as it would go. This means that the photo was as sharp as it possibly could be. If there were any small structers next to the landform, you could also see those.\n \n There is a preconcieved notion that NASA is hiding the discovery that the face is alien made. Why would NASA want to hide it though? If there was alien life on Mars, NASA could gain a lot of money from the publicity. Think about it, NASA could gain so much from proving that that land form is ,in fact, alien made.\n \n In conclusion,the fact that the famous face on mars is an alien made landform, has been almost completely busted. There are too many things going against it. With the better quality cameras, and the fact that NASA would actually get money if it was alien made, has proven this conspiracy theory wrong.",

For example the text says\" a shadowy likeness of a human face.\" This example show that likeness isn't always certain you have to be absolutley sure before you start making claims about what the picture is showing. Did you see it for yourself? Did you do any research about it?\n \n Another reason why the alien story is real is because ,no one officially approved it. They only took pictures of the face.\n \n No one went down on mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says\" only this one had unusual shadws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh\". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it?\n \n The next reason why the alien myth isnt true is because in the passage it says the word\"illusion\" the word illusion means something that you can see but is not there. For example in the tex it states that \" formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth\". This example shows that an illusion may seem real but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable.\n \n Finally, why people say that the landfrom was formed by aliens is because it\n \n \" appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows--- even haunted grocery store for 25 years\". They don't know just because this thing goes publice dosen't mean it is true. For example\" Some people thimk that it is bona fide evidence\".

    Essay: "The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. There is no proof whatsoever of any signs of life on Mars, which means no aliens. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that coincidently looks like a human face. Given the shadows and shape, the Face very much looks like it has a human nose mouth, and eyes. Although up close, there is no resemblence of a human face. Therefore, do not let this anyone fool you.\n \n Pictures have been taken by NASA of the Face to prove it is just a natural landform. Pictures taken from 1976 appear blurry, and not clear, so it is easy to believe that aliens created the Face. Although, in 1998, the pictures taken aren't as blurry, and you can see the structure of the landfrom clearly. Lastly, the picture taken in 2001 is clear and visible. You can perfectly see that close up, the Face is just another natural landform on Mars. From far away, it looks like a human face because of the shadows, but up close, it is nothing more than a simple landform.\n \n Furthermore, on 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to looks for the Face again. When they snapped a photo of it, it was indeed \"ten times sharper than the photo taken in 1976.\" This revealed that it was just a natural landform when the photo appeared online. \"There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n Some people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that \"alien markings were hidden by haze\", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken. Since it was winter in April 1998, it was also the \"cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" Therefore, the camera used had to \"peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.\" This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it's the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face.\n \n Plus, when NASA took another picture in 2001, it was taken using the \"camera's absolute maximum solution.\" Based on what I read, \"each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" There simply can't be anything you can miss using the camera's absolute maximum solution. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, even said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could what they where!\"\n \n Finally, NASA's explanation about the Face on Mars is based on credible information and research. People who believe aliens created the Face often get the information inside their head, making up crazy theories that aren't actually true. Furthermore, NASA went on missions to prove that the Face isn't made by aliens. They took high-quality photos that show that it is just a natural landscape. Besides making things up on their own, skeptics probably take information from the internet on websites that other skeptics have made about aliens creating the Face. You can never trust the internet, and the skeptics who made these websites probably put down their own made up facts and theories to get people to join their side.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just extraordinarily shaped to look like a human head, with shadows to create the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth from far away. Up close, there is not resemblence of a human face at all. Pictures, missions, and years of research have proved it. Plus, there were no signs of aliens, or any life on Mars when they conducted this research. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.",

Also because we have been doing reaserch for so long all of our studies show that there is no possible way that any creature would be able to survive on any other planet in our solar system other then Earth.

When using the Mars Global Survey spacecraft itÂ´s high resolution camera picked up no signs of any type of advanced civilization. Authors of magazines at the time also hyped the Â¨FaceÂ¨ up, to get more people interested in Mars. This story has been used in an array of entertainment, from movies to magazines.\n \n On Earth there are formations called buttes, Â¨ ThatÂ´s a lava domes that take formation of an isolated mesa...Â¨ according to paragraph twelve. Also in paragraph twelve it states that on Earth these landforms are most common in the American west. These particular formations are especially common in the Cydonia region of Mars. Finding these landforms in this region are so common that the scientists at NASA were shocked at how much it resembled a face, knowing it was not an alien artifact. Another reason that we know it is a butte is because it was not only photographed once or twice but three times!\n \n This landform has been photographed by two different spacecraft, the Viking 1 and the Mars Global Surveyor. These spacecraft were spread apart for a span of over 25 years! The Viking 1 picked up the best images it could for itÂ´s time but the much more recent Mars Global Surveyor has a much better and more accurate image of the Â¨FaceÂ¨ than the 1976 photo. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) also took two clear photographs of the landform while the 1976 image is blurry to say the least. In 1976 the image was so fuzzy that no one could tell what was there, which led to reporters and authors to excite the public more than what was necessary.\n \n In 1976 authors and reports hyped up the find of this Â¨FaceÂ¨ on Mars. Authors did this to draw more attention to Mars, which because NASA serves the interests of the people and the government was an outstanding thing but it went to far. After all a face on a planet not all that far from us makes a great headline. Not everyone exaggerated it though NASA, as said in the article, upon releasing the pictures to the public stated Â¨huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â¨ The face on Mars was also used in afilm and in countless magazines across the country.\n \n The Â¨Face\" on Mars is merely just shadows playing tricks on the eye. The Face is merely a landform with shadows in all the right spots playing an illusion on those who see it. Over the years many claims, false or true, have been made about the Face on Mars and they aren going to stop anytime soon. So far no evidence supports the claims of conspiracy theorists, however that doenÂ´t mean they never will. The Â¨FaceÂ¨ on Mars has had many stories told about for over two and a half decades, and they are not going to stop anytime soon, but it is important to know that science has not proven anything about the Â¨FaceÂ¨ on Mars, yet.",

    Essay: "It makes sense that people think this is evidence of an ancient civilization, but according to NASA they wish it was. Nowadays, with science fiction rapidly advancing it's hard to not imagine or want aliens and any sort of other life to exist because of how extraordinary it would be. Up until today NASA hasn't found any life out there, but they want to and all the other science enthusiasts do aswell. If this was a clue to other life out there, just stumbling upon this was way too easy. Obviously, others like this have been found, meaning this isn't anything more special than a natural landform. If aliens really did exist there is a small chance NASA would just easily stumble upon evidence like this one because if this was real it's too good to be true.\n \n Realistically, there's so much reasoning from the experts themselves proving that this isn't anything unusual. First of all there's a thing called shadows and they can easily turn a natural figure into looking like some human-like structure. NASA will literally use technology we don't have access to such as more high-tech cameras to find out things no one ever knew existed. Obviously there are landforms like a butte or mesa meaning this isn't something never found. In fact there's one in Idaho called the,\"Snake River Plain of Idaho\".\n \n When just ordinary people just make an inference it doesn't mean it's true. When thinking about who finds out all the things and goes up to see the things that occur in space it's NASA. Honestly they are the smarter ones, so there's nothing some regular people with opinions can prove. When the picture was shown it shows the landform started to change or deform, meaning if the structure is able to do such a thing looking like a face had no purpose. If it these are signs of an ancient civilization wouldn't there be more evidence discovered by now or wouldn't there be more of these near?",

For example, The Little Dipper, as we call it, is said to look like a spoon. Does that mean that there is a big, shiny spoon in the sky? Of couse not, so why should we say the same about a formation of rocks on Mars that happen to look like a face.\n \n Lastly, NASA has even confirmed that this is just a natural rock formation. I know this because, NASA unveiled an image of this \"face\" and captioned it, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" So, this rock's shadows have given the illusion of a human-like face, which leads to the assumption that there is no real face.\n \n You might be thinking,\" Well, why did the people who discovered this even release the information if it wasn't comepletely factual.\" This is beacuse of the conspiracy theorists. Think about it , if you would have never heard about this Face on Earth in books, magazines, and radio talk shows, would you have believed it? NASA is a very trustworthy and credible association and if information wasn't released until it was proven true than none of this would have happened.\n \n In conlusion, the Face on Earth is nothing but a myth, until there are reliable discoveries that have declared it real. Since there is no evidence that there has been alien formation on Earth, it is just a hoax. I hope I have given a sufficent amount of reasons to argue that the Face is not a face.",

The pictures that they took just need to be developed more to really show the valleys and ravines in the land formation.\n \n The second time they looked at the face they used really good cameras and telescopes to see what it actually was!

    Essay: "Recently we have discovered a new landform on Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture of a martian mesa, these are very common. These martian mesas are similar to the ones on Earth. They are very common in Cydonia, a region on Mars. Many conspiracy therorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is not true.\n \n The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large mesa-like landform with the face an Egyptian god on it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any other one. The reason it looks like a face is because shadows were being cast onto it to make it appear like it had eyes, a mouth and a nose.\n \n In 1998, a camera captured another picture of the formation. It was a little cloudy on the day they took the picture, so we went again to capture another picture. This time in April of 2001, we used a much better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was much more detailed and clear. Once we zoomed in it looked like any other landform we might find. In paragraph 11 Garvin states, Â¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see them!Â¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is no alien activity near this landoform.\n \n In conclusion, it is clear that the Â¨Face on MarsÂ¨ wasnÂ´t created by aliens. We took a much more defined picture and found nothing. Not to metion the fact that there is no water on Mars, so it canÂ´t support life.

Mars has had plenty of speculation on this, yet all the answers have come back that it is impossible. No, there is not a lot of evidence, but there is enough to show that this is just a mesa.\n \n When scientist first found the Face, it was already speculated to be a mesa. This was because of the place where it was located, Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having many mesas in its area. This one just happened to have shadows on it appearing like a face. Let us not forget that the Face was found in 1978. That is when space travel was still a new for the world. Technology was not that advanced as it is today. The last picture was taken in 2001, which was twenty years later after the first photograph was taken. Spacecraft and photos had improved twice as much.\n \n Even though technology has improved we still cannot tell whether it is an alien or not. We must go off of facts.

Forty years later, those consperacies remain in the minds of many people who do not belive NASA when they say, \"It's just a mesa.\" NASA has sent three objects to Mars, the Viking 1 the Vinking 2, and a MGS, in which all three have been able to locate this face shaped messa in a area called Cydonia. Each time the face become a little less noticiable but stil noticable enough to find.\n \n On April 5th, 1998, the MGS along with Michael Malin and his Mars Obriter Camera flew over Cydonia for the first time. They were albe to snap a picture ten times sharper than the one taken in 1976. The picture was uploaded to the internet, where thousands of wed surfers wher waiting to see what it revealed. to many their theory had been proven to be correct, while others still thought it was a alien built structure. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was satisfied with the outcome. Some skepticcs said that alien marking were hiden by the haze. The pictures were taken at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet, causing the Mars Global Surveyor to have to peer through wispy clouds in order to see the face.\n \n The skeptics were right when they said that they had to peek through haze, however they were wrong about the part where they said the haze hid the alien markings. On April 8th, 2001, just three years after the Viking 2 found the face, another mission to Mars reached its location. the 8th of April was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The MGS was able to draw close enough for a second look at the face. Garvin said, \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the feld of view. Milin\"s team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Each pixil in the 2001 imge sans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. He went on to say, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes in the groud or Egyptian-styl pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By saying that, Garvin proved all those speculations about the face being an alien structer, are false.\n \n What the picture actually shows, is not a alien civilation, but is the Martian equivalent od a butte or messa. Buttes and mesas are common landforms around the American West. Garvin addedthat it reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He then explained,\"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\"\n \n After the first picture of the face on Mars was released to the public, NASA explained the picture is just, \"a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It was later added that it is just another Martian mesa,, common around Cydonia. The only difference that seperates this one form the rest are unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n Like the man on the moon, the face on Mars is only a structure that resembals the humans that run Earth. The accidental resemblance is quite astonishing to say the least, thought nevertheless, in reality its \"just anouther Masa\" made by nature not aliens.",

    Essay: "Have you seen the Grand Canyon? Then you probably know that it was not Pual Bunyon who made it, water carved out the Grand Canyon. Nature makes all of the landmarks that we have. Nature can also make landmarks on other planets as well. This is why the Face on Mars has to be a natural formation.\n \n To begin with, I know that the face is a natural landform because it resembles something in the United States. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, thought that the Face resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also said it was a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars. This shows that even one of the top leaders of NASA's Mars Exploration Program believes that this Face is only a natural landform. Besides, NASA would want to find aliens to prove that there is life on Mars.\n \n Equally as important, nobody has proved that there is any other living thing on a planet except for Earth. Mars is too far away from the sun, and there is very little to no oxygen on the surface of Mars. Even if there is life on Mars, it would be mircoscopic organisms, and they could not build a large structure like the Face. This is another reason why the Face is a natural landform.\n \n And finally, if the Face was made by aliens, then wouldn't there have to be some kind of civilization or living area. The aliens would probably want to be somewhat close to their great formation. However, nobody has located any type of civilization on Mars. With the more powerful that NASA had on the latest probe, they said that you could have see things as small as a shack. Plus, if the aliens built one landmark, why not build another one, but nothing else out of the ordinary has been found by scientists. Lastly, nobody has seen a civilization, so the Face could not have been built by aliens.\n \n In conclusion, there is no strong evidence that the Face on Mars is built by aliens. All the facts point to the idea that the Face is just a natural landform. Scientists took planty of pictures of the Face, trying to find whatever made the Face, but they have found nothing. Besides, there is a natural formation that resembles the Face which proves that they both probably formed the same way. Plus, NASA would want there to be living things on another planet besides Earth, but even they reject the idea that the Face was made by aliens. All this shows why the Face on Mars is only a natural landform.",

    Essay: "So, you think that this face on mars, was made by an Alien? Well you thought wrong. There are many reasons why this was not made by an alien. It could be the formation of the land on mars or spacerocks hit it, or it could even be something from inside mars. You dont always know. But Im going to explain why.\n \n Scientist have already went up and discovered this face on Mars because at one time, a lot of people though it was a face made by aliens. Everyone was so excited to see pictures and everything. But some of the information in this article thinks otherwise. In paragraph 7 in this article, it explains how Michael Malin, flew over mars and captured sharper pictures of this \"face. \" But it soon revealed that it was not made by Aliens, it was just a natural lanform and there was no Alien Monuments.\n \n A lot of people were dissapointed, but like I said anything could of happend. The people from NASA took a bunch of pictures and did a lot of tests on it and the picture pretty much said the same thing all along. Plus, Aliens were alive 1000 years ago, if that and so why would people think that they would choose mars, out of all the other planets, and burry an alien in Mars, and it all the sudden show back up. Now do you really think this is true? Now I think it is just a formation in land like the article said.\n \n In the article, some people think that the Alien markings were hidden by haze. Thats a logical reason but I still dont think it is realistic enough. If the haze did not show up in the picture that they took, how could they of not saw it. Plus the Article says that the picture that was most recently took, the lenses on the camera was 10 times sharper and better than the photos that the Vikings photo.\n \n Near the end of the Article it talks about how they even went back again that was even better than the 2 pictures before and that zoomed in so you could see every little detail. Then again it came back with the same results. It was a land formation. They think that it was just a lava dome and has the same formation.\n \n So with all of fthat information I think it is pretty reasonable to say that there was no Aliens on Mars and there deffinataly is not a face from them. This could happen on any other planet to. All along it was just a land formation. At the beggining of the Article I also thought that it was a face from the Aliens too but then I went through the article and there is no possible way. Land forms on its own. So with that being said I guess mars formed with a face on it. Plus rocks and stuff could of made the indents in the face to make it look like eyes.\n \n I hope that was a agreeable argument that aliens were never on mars and proably will never be again.",

    Essay: "Although you have made good points concerning the landform on Mars, I would like to respectfuly disagree on your opinion that aliens are responsible for the bulilding of Cydonia.\n \n In the passage, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", the author has quotes comparing the face, Cydonia, to natrual landforms on earth such as moutains and messas. Through the passage and its comparrisons, we can infer that the \"face\" on Mars is, in face, just made up of natrual causes and the impact of the weather. If you really think and dig deeper, the picture of the face could resemble moutains or small hills posted, or positioned, relativly close together so that the image of a face is possible.\n \n Lastly, the reason as to why Cydonia is in fact just a landform is the way that the author writes the passage. NASA very briefly mentions the possible outcome of aliens, but other than that nothing else has been said about the \"could be\" creatures. They must not be firm believers. Which leads me to the conclusion that is, if NASA had discovered aliens wouldn't that make them most popular? The discovery of new life would, without a doubt, be absolutly fantastic for NASA and its image. The thought that there might be life on Mars is a good enough situatiion to lie and say that you did find life only to have your buisness in the tabloids. We can all infer that is if NASA had discovered that Cydonia had been built by aliens American citizens would be the first to know. You cant hide something like this that would make your buisness so sucsessful.\n \n In conclusion, we can infer that Cydonia is, in fact, a landform of some sort on the face of Mars. We know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natrual causes, not aliens, and that if the face were to be built by aliens it wouldn't be hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple buisnesses.",

    Essay: "The human face that was founded on mars by NASA's Viking 1 sapcecraft. They believe it was created by aliens,but are aliens real? How can they say it was created by aliens when we dont know that aliens are real. In my opinion it has to be the normal land formation, Mars has a lot of rocks and i know there is a lot of stuff in Mars that look like things in our planet. I do believe that it looks like a human face but Mars has sand storms and gets hit by craters all the time and that may be the reason why there is a face on mars.\n \n As we can see in the pictures in 1976, the face looks better then the other pictures. In 2001, the face is gone because of the snadstorm that they had and covered the face. They have no proof that aliens had something to deal withit. They had no foot prints , no sign of an alien, and It looks like to me that t was created by it self. NASA's has no right to say that the face was created by aliens if they have no sign or proof that it was. They don't have proof that aliens are real. That only leads to one conclusion which is that the face on Mars is a land formation.\n \n Therefore, Is the face on Mars created by aliens or is a land formation? The pivtures explain nothing but that it is a land formation. Why? Their is no evidence that it was created by aliens nor anything else. The only way that it would've been created by aliens if NASA's had proof that there were some type of tracks of aliens. They didn't have anything so it leads to one solution. IT has to be created by sand storms and craters.",

    Essay: "The Universe is an intruging and undefined place that we have begun to understand. Although we have started the search of other planets, there remains a plethora of information that is still undiscovered. Existing life forms have not yet been proven true on any other planet besides our own, Earth. Based on evidence and scientific understanding of the world we live in, the Face on Mars is a structure created by random chance.\n \n Pictures taken on other planets, including Mars, only tell us to a certain extent what the planet is like. Rock, dust, and crater formations are seen in many areas of planets. Just as with Earth, other planets change throughout time from asteroid collisions, internal movement, and natural occurences. From the era in which we live in, we can only know so much about the planet Mars itself. Just as well, full scale space exploration has only recently become possible with innovation and technology of our society. As seen in paragraph seven, \"Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" This proves to us that new additions to technology have been made in a short time period, from 1976 to 1998, twenty-two years. We can see from this that everything, with a second, more detailed look can change.\n \n In addition to technological improvements and understanding of the universe, our belief in social media and public news is phenominal. We trust in almost everything that news reporters, magazines, websites, and spreading word tells us. Rumors and false reports spread quickly and in a wide range. Also, expounding on existing rumors happens often. When the public heard of the Face on Mars, word of aliens and other beings existing on Mars dispersed through the people of Earth. Many people had believed that NASA was keeping such information in secrecy from the media. As public interest peaked, NASA was persuaded to investigate the landform on Mars once again. The public interest can be seen in paragraph five, \"The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" This shows us that our belief in public reports is true. We believe in what media and others tell us, not always specifically what the source, in this case, NASA tells us.\n \n Lastly, NASA researchers are professionals who work with outerspace accounts everyday. It is more plausible to believe in what they tell us rather than what others tell us. As concluded in NASA's research it is seen in further pictures that the Face on Mars is just a landform. There is no extraterestrial link with picture or Mars.\n \n In Conclusion, Pictures and technology back when the original, Face on Mars, was seen is old and outdated. Newer technology proves to us that the picture just happens to be by coincidence and chance. Social media may spread rumors or false reports and should not always be believed. Public attention should be given directly to the source in which the information has come from. Therefore, NASA's research and conclusions should be of our most interest and paramount importance. The Face on Mars is not of alien origin and is simply just a landform created by chance.",

    Essay: "What it that? How did it get there? Will we be attacked by marshans?\" Yes, these are the questions that a lot of people asked NASA when they found an interesting photo on Mars. The picture is supposedly a \"face\", but to astronomers, it is just a rock formation.\n \n Hundereds of people think that there was a human head on Mars, but from what astronomers had to say about it, it was the truth. In 1976, NASA got their first look at the \"face\" on Mars. A couple days later NASA relased the image of the \"face\" to the public the caption was simple as it states in the text, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" After that, it was a pop icon, attracting people into learning more about this planet.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" became very popular when it came to scaring humans. According to the text it states \"It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" In films, as always, Hollywood would \"tweak\" the truth to have more people come and see the movie. This was partly the cause of people believing that there is life on mars. However, astronomers are saying that there could have been life on Mars because, of dry river and lake beds on the surface of The Red Planet. Still, that does not prove that there were marshans.\n \n Astronomers are still trying to convince people that there is not life on Mars. According to the text it states \"What the picture actually shows ins the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" This is showing what it really looks like. Besides, from background knowledge it is not possible for a human to live on Mars. There is no oxygen for us to breathe, no water, and no food. Nothing.\n \n Technology has advanced in the past 25 years, showing us clearer pictures in space. This is incuding the \"face\" on Mars. It will forever be a mystery, but from what astronomers have said it will always be a rock formation.",

Some scientists believe that the face was an alien artifact. Scientists have used better camera that could even show a small shacks.

Garvin said \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" Scientists are able to see pictures closer than before. Garvin also said \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" All the new technologies can get the actually picture more clearly unlike the picture from 1976.\n \n Then, scientists have better technoloy, they are able to go to Mar with new machines.

Well it was one of the biggest things that was a thing because they were figuring out if it was a real face or not. It was difficult but i'm pretty sure they found out about it even if it wasn't a face but were about to find out.\n \n The face was a really difficult thing to focus on for as long as they did. I don't think they would've focused on it as much as they did if it wasn't so important to figure out honestly. It was just a shadow they saw out of plain sight while a spacecraft was circling around and then they suddenly saw a shady shadow and it looked like a human face. Only a few days later is when they showed the image they took of they shadow for everyone to see. The face begin to be known and everyone was soon to know about it after they reached out and posted the picture of the unknown face.\n \n There was many obstacles to find out who's face it was. \"Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planrt, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face\" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,1), This little bit of a paragraph tells us that basically someone was out just snapping pictures and found this.

The shuttle NASA sent out was called \"Viking 1\". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the \"Human Face\".\n \n Even though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the \"Face\" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying \"Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.\n \n And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. We were very anxious to see the picture... the picture revealed ... like we said a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\n \n Everyone wasn't satisfied. The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98 which was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camrea on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n So then I ordered mission controllers to look again. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that looks straight down and scans teh planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.\n \n April 8, 2001 coudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough fro a second look.

So if there we objects in this pictures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks youll know where they were.\n \n The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms.

These all show that the Face is just an ordinary rock.\n \n The last picture of the Face was taken in 2001. This was a very detailed picture, even for being taken so long ago. Each pixel in the image was equal to 1.56 meters in real life. This means that any other nearby buildings or tombs would've been seen near the rock. There weren't any buildings or any sign of actual alien life nearby, so the picture at least proved that the Face wasn't a sign from the aliens, but just a rock.\n \n The only reason that the Face looks so much like a face is because of the shadows. Without the shadows, the Face might just look like an ordinary rock on mars. The shadows themself give the illusion of the rock having eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Those shadows are the only reason that the Face IS\n \n the Face.\n \n Without those shadows, the Face wouldn't be so famous. Nobody would have probably ever known or cared about it.\n \n The conspiracy theorists and many people in general probably think that NASA is hiding the fact that aliens are real, so they're lying about the Face and just saying that it's a landform, when they think it's a sign that aliens exist. That's not true. NASA is a company that needs money like all the rest. They know that telling people that aliens were real would profit them a lot, so they wouldn't just hide the fact that the Face was an alien artifact if it was one. NASA probably wishes that they had found an ancient cililization on Mars, just for the profit.\n \n The theorists are wrong about the Face being an ancient artifact. The latest picture of the Face is so detailed, that any ancient civilizations nearby would be visible. Also, the Face is only the Face because the rock has shadows along it that makes it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Finally, NASA would proabably like to find an ancient civilization on Mars, just so that they could profit from finding something related to alien life. They wouldn't just hide the truth if they could gain money from it. Therefore, theorists should just realize that facts are facts, and that if NASA finds an ancient civilization on Mars, they'll tell everyone.",

    Essay: "Have you ever seen anything unusual and thought that it was just a natural landform, but other people thing it was created by extraterrestials? Well, some people argue that the Face on Mars was created by aliens and some people believe that it was created natural. I believe that the Face formed naturally. I believe this because of the camera quantity and the shadows and clouds of the planet.\n \n First, I am going to discuss the camera quality. The quality of the camera is important so that the picture of the Face is clear. When the scientists first took the picture of the Face in 1976, there was an unclear picture. As time went on the cameras got more and more advanced that to the point you could see every detail of the Face. In 2001, when scientists took a clear picture of the Face, they identified it as a mesa, a natural landform in Western America. Also, they said that if there were any other alien landforms like egyptian pyramids that it would show up in the picture. Last, in the passage it states, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" This quote from the passage proves that the Face is a natural landform and not created by aliens. This is how the camera quality prove whether or not the Face was created by aliens or is a natural landform.\n \n Next, I am going to discuss how the clouds and shadows of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. First, the shadows of Mars gives the Face an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. In the passage it states, \"Huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, mouth.\" This shows that the Face is not really a face and it is actually a natural landform. Next, the clouds on Mars can throw off the cameras vision of the face. When the MGS took a picture of the Face when it was cloudly on Mars the picture was unclear and scientists could not see the Face in detail. Although, in 2001 when the MGS explored Mars, it was not cloudy. MGS was able to get a clear picture of the Face and scientists identified it as a natural landform and not an alien creation. This is how the shadows and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.\n \n Finally, the camera quality, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. The better the camera quality the more proof there is to say that the Face is a natural landform. Also, without the clouds and shadows of Mars, the Face is easily identified as a natural landform. To conclude, this is how the quality of the camera, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.",

The man continues to argue with me and say that aliens are real and this alien artifact looks like a human face. I have to keep telling him that this is just a natural landform which is called a butte or mesa. This certain mesa looks like a face only because it shows most of the characteristics that a human has such as; the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth which are all just formed by shadows. The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you \"supposedly\" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens. I tell him that Nasa was able to figure it out because a mesa is a a big rock formation that just has a flat top and thats what the face looked like if you see it up close.

This could just be are pollution is spreding not just in the air but even in space. Or Mars could just be doing what earth does every amount of years earth changes in like the land-scap mars land-scap could just be changing.\n \n On Earth we have weird stuff happen a lot like symbols in corn feilds, some people think they see flying space ships some people are just crazy aliens don't exist. We don't have any proof that aliens exist like just because some cows go missing or found dead doesn't mean they didn't just leave or a wild animal didn't kill them. I don't know how to explaine the corn feilds but the \"flying space ship\" is just a jet or plane nothing big and if people say other people have been kinapped by aliens or saw some aliens they would be lying because aliens don't exist.\n \n Earth today has so many pollution problems rigth now it's just not funny but are pollution could somehow start to spread to other planets because we have air pollution. Air pollution can spread pretty easy so when we like have rocket and go to a different planet we may bring different substances to that planet it's not use to. Or just how we went to the moon the pollution we brougth to the moon could have spreaded all over the galxay.\n \n So we all know how the Earth changes once every speacial year or years but were use to that cause we know it's going to happen. So now there is a new change but not to planet Earth but to Mars it's weird but it's just a planet. Like are it may have some new changes may not this doesn't mean it has to do with aliens. We have traveld or seen with are cameraas in space so many planets but never one trace of aliens or any life form so that means aliens aren't real.\n \n So in conclusion with all the evidence we got from prior knowleged and reading this article there are no other life form on anyother planet just Earth. Also aliens don't exist all the weird things that happen in the world or on different planets all happen because humans do something wrong to the earth. We sometimes get granted the most beautiful things ever or it hits us with earth quakes or hurricans and punishes us so do good to the earth not bad.",

The Martian Mesa was said to look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. That statement leads people to believe that there had to be life to build something like that. But, with the shadow showing groves perfectly and the holes in the mesa made it look real. The \"Face\" is just another Mesa on Mars.\n \n First, the pixels and the picture produced by the camera at that time weren't as developed as the camera used in 2001. You also have to take into account that, as time goes on, most products will be improved and made better, in this case that's how it was with the cameras, with a 25 year gap in between.\n \n The text says, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" The text also supports the claim by stating, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n Additionally, the shadows had appeared to be hitting the natural landform just right. The scientists belive this because, they have seen many other mesas while traveling in space, this on just happened to have a interesting impression at first sight.\n \n The text proves this by including, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusoin of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n The text also says, There must have been a degree of spurise amoung mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"\n \n Believers in this \"face\" may claim there was never a clear picture of the \"face\" taken after the first photo.\n \n To support this they may think that the photographer taking the picture may not be able to see the clouds. The text says, \"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 - a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to the Face.\"\n \n However, NASA was able to take another picture of the Face when the clouds weren't in the way and it wasn't winter. The text says, \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 - a cloudless summer day in Cydonia - MGS drew close enough for a second look. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.\"\n \n The Face captured on Mars has proven to be a natural landform. With shadows covering it and dips to make facial features it can across as an Egyptian Pharaoh. This is proven because, of the high tech cameras and the shadows only lasted one day allowed scientists to prove their claim - the Face was just a normal mesa landform.",

So skeptis said that perhaps the the alien markings were hidden by the haze. \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids you could tell what they are.\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Matian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around American West. This pictures shows a face but it is just a landform with a shadow making it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. People think that aliens are making signs saying that this land is theres but its just a landform nothing more, nothing less. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydoria Mars Global Surveyor (MOC) drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolutuin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\n \n The Face on Mars has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for twenty five years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancietn civilazation on Mars. But there is no such thing as aliens, nothing can live on mars or any other planets besides earth. Some scientists think that the Face was an alien artifact, photographing \\Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the red planed in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.",

    Essay: "Imagine it's 1976 and Nasa reveals an interesting photo looking down upon Martian landscape. The photo catches your eye as it contains what apears to be a giaint face made of rock coming out of the sand. Nasa states that the \"face\" is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. But you also hear other people saying that the face is an ancient alien artifact! What do you believe? Pop culture quickly jumps on the idea of aliens because that view point is exciting. Meanwhile NASA is a government backed and very credible source. I say that the educated person would listeto NASA. I believe that the \"face on Mars\" is just another natural landform becasue the face looks just like a butte or mesa does on Earth, NASA's powerful cameras haven't captured anything alien looking on near the face, and becasue the majority of NASA and other creidble scientists don't believe that the face is alien.\n \n According to the article Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the area where the famous picture of the face was taken. There is nothinig unusal or different about this specific mesa exept the shadows on top of it. These shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Mesas and buttes are landforms that are also very common on Earth around the American West. The Middle Butte in Idaho is a an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. I'm sure if pyramids started being discovered on the surface of mars thats one thing, but just a single mesa that looks a bit like a face is no reason to immediatly blame aliens.\n \n Another reason why the face is just a natural landform is because we have seen proof that is nothing but a landform.. On April 8, 2001 which was a cloudless day in Cydonia, another picture of the face was taken with a very powerful camera that used its maximum resolution for the picture. When you look at this picture it is almost hard to immgine a face even being there! The illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth is gone. All that remains in this picture are some cracks and rough edges on the rock structure. To many seeing is believing and this picture has allowed many to see the truth that the \"face on mars\" is nothing but a myth.\n \n Some suporters of the idea that the structure was created by aliens argue that NASA is hiding more evidence and mabey even distorting images that point to the face being built by aliens. This is wrong because alien civilizations would increase NASA's funds and popularity. Also it would be almost immpossible to keep an alien secret from the public with so many immployees knowing. These examples show why the \"face on mars\" is just another natural land formation.",

    Essay: "There has been a lot of debate circling wether or not the infamous \"Face on Mars\" is an actual alien made structure of a face or just a natural landform. In my professional opinion its safe for me to assume it is just a natural landform.\n \n Although it resembled a face in the first picture it doesn't necesarrily mean it was created by life forms to look like a face. The only features you can make out on the so-called \"Face\" are deep holes for eyes, a pointed part for the nose, and a line for the mouth. It doesn't have any distinct features. If if was made my martians they most likely wouldn't want a monument of a human's face so what is it supposed to be? I'll you what it is butte or mesa, a natural landform that is common on Earth.\n \n Another reason you know it isn't a face is the camera quality of the first image. The camera quality in 1976 wasn't as advanved as today's technology is. The pictures in both 1998 and 2001 were both much more clear than the original photograph. Although you can make out somewhat of a face it doesn't mean thats what it was. It could have just been a blurry picture.\n \n Conspriacy theorists say it actually was aliens and they made the face but NASA would greatly benefit from finding actual life on Mars. If NASA found legitimate alien lifeforms it could benefit the whole world. If they were non-hostile they could teach us how to make and use their technology. We could learn a lot from them, like why the landforms on their planet resemble faces. NASA has been trying to find alien life for years, if they found it they woudln't deny them and say they don't exist.\n \n There are a lot of people that think it has to be a face. And the pictures are from 25 years apart, so anything could have happened to the landform in that long. Natural wear and tear could have washed across the surface of it and rendered it a natural landform. In all seriousness they could be right but it would take a lot more than 25 years to ruin solid rock.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" had a good 25 year run. It was mostly scaring people and giving conspiracy theorists ammunition to shoot at the government to try to get us to admit there is other life out there, but its time to face reality. It is not a face. It really is a landform. If there was life on Mars you could see it with the cameras we have today, but sadly, no such luck. It's not a face on Mars, we just have imaginations that run wild with wonder.",

In the passage \"Unmasking the Face of Mars\" there are two major opinoins on if there once was a civilization on Mars or if it was a natural landform. Based on text and factual evidence I belive that the \"face\" on Mars is a natural land form.\n \n First, \"on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" (10) \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoulotion.\" (10) Which Means they got the best picure they could.\n \n In addition, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digitial image 3 times bigger than you the pixel size.

(9) Some people are not satisfied with the results. They say,\"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" (9)\n \n Based on experts, text, and factual evidence I belive that the \"Face\" on Mars is a natural land form. I belive that the \"Face\" on Mars is just a natural landform because the author uses evidnce like how they went back on a clear day a took magnified-detailed photos and how things would have showed up if there were things living on Mars.

    Essay: "Many people are thinking that the \"face\" on Mars is an actual face, or they say it was created by aliens. It was proven very well that it is not an actual face. One it is an rock, two the angle the camera was at cought the shadow of it so it seemed as if it was a face, and three the only reason it was told to be a face was for marketing.\n \n My first reason was because it is a rock on mars. It states in paragraph three that it is a huge rock in formation of a human head. therefore that is one reason it is showing everyone that it is just a rock. The rock over the years has wathered down and it has more crevisises and it is losing the foerm of a face. If there was an actual face barryed under there it would never really lose its true form.\n \n My second reason is that the angle of the camera was so that you can see the shadow and if they just wouldve gotten a better angle you woyld be able to see that there was nothing really there. If you were too also look at othere surroundings you would be able to see that there are many other masas on Mars. It also states that it may have been the pixles in the cameras. If we had the technology we have now when they first found it you would most likely have a better picture of it and be able to see what it actually looked like.\n \n My final reason for it not being a face is that the only reason they continued on the theory of it being a face because they wanted good marketing. So itr seemed as if they kept the theory continued because they wanted to have marketing for NASA. Obviously it worked, because the story stated that they started to have hollywood film it appeared in books, magazines, and even raido talks.\n \n Thoes are my reasonings that the \"face\" on Mars is actually just a rock. It was proven to be just another one of the many rocks on mars, the angle of the camera could've been off, the kept the theory going just for marketing.",

    Essay: "A face on mars! NASA found a face on mars that is said to be a natural landform but many think it is alien creation. There are many reasons that shows that claim of it being an alien creation is false for example there have been 3 pictures of the \"face\" the face looks different in each, it is a lava dome, and there is not a reason for NASA to keep it a secret.\n \n In the article they give 3 pictures to look at and in each one the landform looks a little different because of the new advance technology. For example the picture in 1976 yes it does look like a face but that could be just because of the low camera quality at the time of the picture taken. The picture could've been anything at the time a rock formation is and was the logical explanation for this. For example in the second picture taken in 1998 the landform is a little blurry but easier to see and in this picture it doesnt resemble a face at all it was revealed to be a natural landform. The example shows that NASA confirmed that it is just a natural landform and is not an alien creation. It does not even look like a face in the sharper picture take in 1998. The last example is the picture taken in 2001. Many thought that the picture taken in 1998 was not proving anything because it would have been winter in mars so the picture had to be taken through wispy clouds so they went again in 2001 they went on a cloudless summer day. For example in the passage it says,\" Malin's team captured an extra ordinary photo using the camera's absoulte maximum resolution.\" The example shows that NASA took an amazing clear photo revealing that it is just a land form.\n \n In the article there are three different missions. In the first mission they fiqures it was just another common Martian mesa. For example in the text it says,\" Scientist fiqured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows.\" The example shows that they said that it is just mesa with unusual shadows. The next mission sais that it is indeed a natural landform. For example in the story it says,\"Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial viking photos and posted on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform.\" The example shows that the new cameras showed that it was just a landform but that still wasnt enough evidence to some. The third mission was in 2001. For example in the text it says,\" a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" The example shows that this mission was on a cloudless day so there would be nothing blocking the view of the landform. All three missions they all agreed it was just a natural landform\n \n Why would NASA want to hide it and there is enough evidence that it is just a natural landform There would be no reason to \"hide\" if aliens were found. For example in the text it says,\"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars.\" The example shows that if there was a civilzation they would not keep it a secreat because they could get more money to study it and in the long run more money for discovering it. Another example is in the story it says,\" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes ont he ground or Eqyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" The example shows that if there was ancient civilization there they had to live somewhere and we would be able to see their shacks. The last example is in the story it says,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" The example shows that it is a butte or mesa and it even looks like the middle butte in the River. There is no way the \"face\" is anything but rocks.\n \n In conclusion there is no evidence what so ever that the landform is an alien creation. There was though 3 missions that have evidence showing that it is a landform, there were three different pictures,and there was no reason for NASA to hide this dicovery. The \"face\" is just a natural landform.",

    Essay: "Is it possible that the face on Mars could have been created by aliens? Some people believe that the Face on Mars was formed by aliens; however,\n \n I do not believe that is possible. A few of the pictures taken of the Face on Mars were taken when it was cloudy,but that is the only information that suggests that aliens could have made the face. Many scientists have done extensive research on the Face on Mars, and they have found that it is nothing more than a natural landform in the shape of a face. If you believe aliens formed the face on Mars, then be prepared for multiple facts that go against that belief.\n \n Numerous scientists have studied the area in which the surreal face formation is located, and they have found various mesas. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the place in which you would find the face. Because of these facts, it is believed that the Face on Mars is just another Martian mesa that is coincidently shaped like a face. NASA even captioned one of the pictures saying \"Huge rock formation that was formed by shadows, giving the illusion of a face.\" This explanation makes a tremendous amount of sense more than aliens creating the face.\n \n Although quite a few people vehemetley express their opinions that the face is evidence of life on Mars, NASA says that they are not hiding any information about alien life. Why would NASA keep life on Mars a secret? If life was found on Mars, NASA would share the information because they would make a lot of money from it. They would make history if they had proof of life in Mars! Some defenders of NASA even wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. There is absolutely no way that NASA would turn down that amazing oppurtunity and keep the evidence to themselves.\n \n The picture taken by Michael Malin is another reason to believe that the face was not an alien creation. He took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos by using his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC). The picture taken on April 5, 1998, revealed that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. There was no reason to believe that the face was not natural, but some people still believed that aliensdid in fact make the formation. The tenacious scientists were still determined to find evidence to make everyone see the truth.\n \n April 8, 2001, was a cloudless day in Cydonia, and Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the face to capture a extraordinary photo.\n \n The picture was taken using the camera's maximum resolution. If there were objects in the picture near the face, you could have seen what the objects were. There was nothing unusual aroung the Face on Mars.\n \n The picture shows a Martion equivalent to landforms common around the American West. It reminds some people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is the same height as the Face on Mars. This evidence supports the idea that the giant, face-shaped formation is a natural landform, nothing more, nothing less. Aliens are not even proved to exist, let alone form a landform like this one.",

    Essay: "The face that was found on Mars may be made by natural causes. There are many reasons why this odd shaped figure would be made by natural causes, like gust of wind throwing rocks around could make that human like face. Or something that can pick up big boulders and can move them into place. There are many reasons why this face showed up, but aliens are not one of them.\n \n What might have caused rocks to move into place to create this human like face is large gust of wind. Or something that is really strong. Or it could have been a big pile of rock and just formed over the years into a face. In the story \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", there is more then one lump of rock there is two. The second is just not shaped like a face. There are spots everywhere on this planet with lumps of rock. Most of them are formed by erosion. Erosion is the process of being broken down. There could be parts of the lump of rock that wasn't strong enough to hold it's self up. They may have fell in to make the eye shape. The nose could have been another small pile of rock that made it look like a nose. This is from up high it may look different down low. It may look like a big piece of rock. There are different views or angles you can look at it.\n \n Other people may think that aliens did this. But there was no traces or marks left behind that can detect an alien.

    Essay: "The 'Face' in Space\n \n The Face is a bonafide example of a natural landform. However, some people say that it is an ancient artifact that proves that there is life on Mars. Scientists have said that the Face is just another buttle or Martian mesa, that the Face is just another natural landform and there isn't a face at all. It is just a common landform.\n \n Even if the masses aren't satisfied, the Face will remain just a buttle or Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Cydonia, the place where the Face was found. The Face only has shadows that make it appear like a face. Conspiracy theorists say that the Face might be evidence of ancient civilization on Mars, but defenders of NASA's budget beg to differ.\n \n Truly, the face is just a natural landform.\n \n As the text states \"There wasn't an alien monument after all.\"The passage also reads that Malin sent a team to capture a more clear picture of the Face. Some said that there might have been hidden alien markings, and they were proven wrong. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to get a clear picture of the Face. As it turns out, there really wasn't a alien monument after all.\n \n In the beginning, there was no face to begin with. The Face only had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see and here in the passage it reads \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" This shows that there wasn't a face, just an illusion.\n \n There is the arguement that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization. At the time the picture of the Face was taken, it was winter. Perhaps the alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze. Mission controllers even looked again. On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Cydonia.\n \n In conclusion, the Face turned out to be a common landform. Just another buttle, another landform, another rock formation, not really a face at all. There is no evidence that there was even a civilization and there wasn't even evidence that there was life to begin with! Again, there could have been alien markings that were covered by the haze, and there could have been life on Mars.

Scientist don't present a theory unless they have evidence to back it up.\n \n One reason that the \"face on mars\" is there, is butte mesa.

Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. The mesa located in Idaho is about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n \n Another thing, is that cameras are sent into space to take pictures of planets and record everything that is found. Scientist enlarge the photos 3 times bigger, to see everthing within it. If there were anything in the picture that seemed unusual, the cameras would allow you to see it. Any objects, like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyrsmids. Even small shacks, you would be able to see it.\n \n Thirdly, scientists don't present a theory unless they have gone threw precautions and looked over all of there evidence to support the theory. In the article it talks about how the scientists, sent two diffrent cameras up to make sure the clouds wren't the issue of what they saw. Also, they blew the images up to see if there was an objects. To make sure that nothing could endanger there theory, of it just being a butte mesa. If the scientists really didnt believe there theory was valed, they would'nt have taken so many precautions.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face on Mars\" is probably just a naturally occuring landform on Mars. With the evidence of the butte mesa in West America. The cameras going up and taking pictures more than once. Also, the scientists taking many precautions to prove that the \"Face on Mars\", is a butte mesa. The theory that the \"Face on Mars\", is just a naturally occuring landform, is highley likley.",

    Essay: "Many people believe this very famous \"Face on Mars\" was indeed created by aliens. We've been hoping for explanations of this and possibly another alternative than the Face just being a landform on Mars. Although, after reading the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", NASA had indeed found an explanation that shows the Face is surely not created by aliens, but it is just another natural landform that we have discovered.\n \n First of all, the Face has been discovered as a natural landform because NASA scientists even said, \"There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just anohter Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" Even though the face caused much excitement between the scientists, we as the scientists needed to face the fact after all the research and pictures that showed the Face was not something extravagant the aliens on Mars had created. So even though the Face gained much popularity commercially, it was just another landform like the many other ones on that planet.\n \n Also, finding out their was ancient civilization or aliens currently on Mars would benefit NASA greatly, as it would be seen as a huge accomplishment. The article states, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" My question is for you, why would NASA try to cover up or hide that they indeed found aliens or life forms creating things on Mars? NASA spent a long time taking pictures and doing research to look at this kind of stuff, even though something like this would be a huge event in all of history. It would become a great accomplishment for NASA and they would definitely want to share what they have discovered. When they first found the Face, NASA gained popularity from commercials and it became an icon. So if the Face was indeed created by aliens, NASA would gain even more popularity, if they thought the face was anything more that a landform after all the pictures and research.\n \n Finally, the area that the Face was discovered in a common place for those landforms. The article says, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.\" Even though it caused a great surprise, the scientists soon realized it was just another landform, which they the sensation was over. Don't worry though, a few scientists did actually believe the Face was an alien artifact, but let me tell you, they were wrong. \"On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camers team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious websurfers were waiting when the imagine first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" So as you can see, those scientist were proved wrong by that picture that proved there was no actual alien monument, as they believed so.\n \n In conclusion, I hope I have convinced you with the evidence from over the years involving the unmasking of the Face on Mars. The Face was not created by aliens because NASA would not hide the information, there is signifact pictures evidence to prove this argument, and the Face was in a common place for things like those to be found, in a place called Cydonia. NASA worked on it for years, trying to find the truth, only to find they had discovered another natural landform. Also, even though some scientists may have thought there could be alien artifacts and it was created by the aliens on Mars, they soon realized what the Face truly was.",

    Essay: "There have been conspiracy theories going around that the Face on Mars is actually created by aliens, but it can be proven to everyone that the claims are false. The Face is simply a natural landform, and NASA is not trying to hide or distort the truth. Some may still be skeptical, but there is proof that the Face is not an alien monument of any sort.\n \n As stated before, the Face is actually a natural landform. It's the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa found commonly in the American West. Fellow researcher, Jim Garvin, even states that it reminds him of the \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\"(paragraph 12). It can be proven that Earth landforms definitely aren't made from aliens, and the same could be said for the Face.\n \n The Face isn't even an actual face, so it's unlikely it even is an alien monument. The only reason the rock formation resembles a face is because the shadows cast an illusion of facial features such as eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Pictures of the Face were captured two other times using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Skeptics may believe that NASA messed up somewhere or that something was flawed, but it is highly unlikey that this is true. The procedure was performed on a cloudless summer day with the best camera at NASA's disposal.\n \n Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face wasn't created by aliens, believing that NASA is just attempting to hide the evidence of an ancient civilization. In truth, this is false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life. How can one believe NASA is keeping secrets about alien life from the public when it would benefit to do the opposite. Proof of an alien civilization would be more helpful to share than hiding it, so why do people believe otherwise?\n \n Whether or not people believe the Face is actual just a Martian landform, it doesn't affect the researchers of NASA. Evidence to support the claim has been provided, but what proof do the skeptics have? Can they really disprove the truth or are they just desperate for attention?",

Still some people believed it was an alien artifact and the clouds on mars covered some alien markings that may have been covered by haze.

Others questioned theorists about why NASA would want to hide something like that and how it would benefit scientists at NASA.

Most of the evidence is on the side of it being a natural landform. What shows this is the landforms on Earth, the photos taken, and the research done on the \"Face on Mars\".\n \n To begin, the landforms you see everyday are just like the\"Face on Mars\".\n \n NASA believes, that this so called alien made feature is really just a natural landform. This qoute show that they beileve it.\"It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Another piece of evidence is that it is the same size a another landform on Earth. This landform that is talked about is a lava dome which is in the form of a isolated mesa.\n \n There were many photos taken of Mars. Many of those photos showed this feature. When the first picture was taken, it was very hard to see it it was natural or created by aliens. When they got more advanced photos it became clear that it was not an alien created landform and was really a natural landform.\"When the image apeared on the JPL web site reaveling ... a natural landform.\" This qoute is just another piece of evidence if how photos helped show it was a natural landform.\n \n Throughout many years, NASA has done a lot of research. They are always finding out new things. They did a lot of research on the \"Face of Mars\"during those years. They found out where it was located. They also found out that it was a natural landform throughout all of the reseach done. People can always look up the research done on the \"Face of Mars\" to learn more about it and to find proof that it is a natural landform.\n \n Many people would say that this is not like anything articles say. That is only true because even magazines,books,radio talk shows, tell lies just to get you to read them and buy them so they can make money. As all of this evidence shows, the landforms on Earth, the photos taken, and the the research done on this topic are the reason that prove that the \"Face of Mars\" is a natural landform and was not created by aliens.",

The first thing that you have wrong is that the Face seen on Mars is of alien orgin. The Face that you see in the picture is just an oddly shaped Martian mesa. In fact there are very common on that region of Mars so for all we know there could very well be more oddly shaped mesas in that area.\n \n The fact is that you miss read the caption of the picture or didn't even look at it at all. If you would've you should have seen the caption stating that the reason it resembles a human head is because of the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

The first being that it is just a mesa which dosen't have a distinct form, which means that if another one forms it could very well be a dog or a cat. The second being that you may have just miss read or not have read the caption.

First, they have updated images showing it is a rock formation, just like here on Earth. Second, if it could prove aliens once lived, or currently live on Mars, then NASA would not hesitate to publish it. The Mars face is only a natural rock formation.\n \n There are newer images proving it is a rock. With our growing technology we sent spacecrafts close to Cydonia, and they show rock formations. This rock formation is much like what we have on Earth. The shadows cast upon the rock, giving it facial features. On a different day, those shadows are not there.\n \n Why would NASA keep this a secret? NASA would thrive from finding alien lifeforms. Why would they keep that private. As the story states, \" Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" They want that, because their budget would increase and they could do better projects if they had published it.\n \n Nerws articles claimed it was a rock formation long before any conspiracy theories were out. Soon, after the second shot of it, scientists proved it was just another rock formation that resembles many we have here on Earth today.\n \n Even though the photos look like they have facial features, and could be the remains of an ancient alien civilization, it is not. Some facts to back it up are that NASA would not hide something this benefitual to them from the public, scientists have proven it was made naturally by rock, and better resolution photos prove that it is just a rock formation with shadows showing facial features. In Mars' revolution the sun does not always cast a shadow on it, and that is why the features do not always show up, proving that the Mars face is just another face in conspiracy history.",

    Essay: "Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed \"Face on Mars\". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.\n \n First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now. Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface?\n \n Additionally, even if NASA had found this further evidence, why would the company try to hide it? Not only would releasing such infrormation to the public leave NASA with all sorts of world renouned achievements, it would be more than beneficial for the company's financial standpoint. Releasing statements as big as signs of life on Mars would do wonders for the company. The more achievements, the more sponsors will see the potential in investing money in a program such as NASA. Adding to that, the more sponsors, the more projects NASA can fund, and by extension, the more the foundation will be able to learn and teach the public.\n \n Probably the most obvious piece of evidence that busts the idea of unknown life, is that these photos were taken in 1976 (according to paragraph 5 of Unmasking the Face on Mars) . Technology at that time was still fairly primitive, especially for space travel. The photo just happened to be taken at the right time, at the right angle, by a pilgrim piece of technology. Further pictures, such as the ones taken in 2001, reveal that the \"face\" is just a mesa, with next to no details that resemble that of a human complextion. Think of it as the\n \n \"...Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\" (paragraph 12)\n \n All in all, this \"face\" on Mars is no different from other conspiracies. Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the \"Bigfoot\" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence. The face on Mars is simply a clump of rock, nothing to be even slightly concerned about. Unless, of course, you are an individual who likes to be concerned about clumps of rock.",

    Essay: "Many people thought that the face on Mars was created by aliens. I do not agree with that statement because there is no evidence supporting that theory. However, there is evidence supporting that the face is merely a landform that was created naturally. Throughout the article, it shares ideas from NASA, which is the foundation that discovered the face on Mars in the first place.\n \n The first statement that the article makes about the face being a natural landform is, \"New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" This one statement shows that NASA, one of the biggest names in space industry, believes the face is only a mesa. The people back in the Jet Propulsion Lab must have been surprised to see such a startling sight, but luckily NASA provides more information to show that the face is only a simple landform.\n \n The text provides a caption from the message unveiled by NASA. The caption states, \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" This exact caption says the exact proof that the face is clearly just a rock formation. Every person should already know how shadows can, well, cast shadows that may give illusions of other objects.\n \n Some people that believe in aliens may say that it would be crazy to think that a rock formation and shadows could form the illusion of a face, but I've seen shadows that are casted when the sun hits them just right. Isn't it completely logical that the sun could hit the shadows to fill the holes in the rocks? I sure believe so.\n \n The last quote I would like to give as my evidence is, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you couold see what they were!\" This single statement shows that the cameras they were using to the maximum resolution, would in fact show if there was actually an alien artifact on the planet. But the strongest possible photo showed no ancient alien artifacts. It only showed a natural rock formation with shadows that formed what appeared to be a face.",

    Essay: "The year is 2041, and astronaut Jeff Goudard has just landed in the region of Cydonia. He is extremly exited becouse he will be the first human to see the only alien artifact known to man. As soon as he lands, he sees the face. Jeff's jaw drops practically to his feet. He relizes the \"Face on Mars\" is really just a plain old mesa, just like the ones out in the American West. Now just like this astronaut, there are probably hundreds of people that think that the \"Face on Mars\" is some sort of alien monuent, but in reality science and logical thinking has proven that in reality, the \"Face on Mars\" is really just a Mesa almost identical to the ones found out in the American West.\n \n First off is the logical thinking portion. In the region of Cydonia mesas are incredibly common.\n \n Now this particular mesas is oddly shapped, I will give it that, but it is just a mesa. What gives it human fetures is just the shadows. Just look at 1976 Viking one photograph. You can clearly see shadows Just look slightly below it, you can see a long shadow protruding from the mesa. Now on the flip side, look at the picture captured on 1998 when it was cloudy out and there were no shadows at all. The image just makes it look like a weird rock, not like a human face at all.\n \n While still on the topic of the photographs, the one snapped on 2001 also proves that the so called \"Face on Mars\" is really just a mesa becouse of not the actual formation, but the surronding area. It was taken by a very high quality camera. In fact, it's pixles spanned 1.56 meters whereas the best Viking photograph the pixles spanned 43 meters. That ment that you could zoom in around the area of the mesa to scan if there was any other evidence of alien life. So scienteists and analysts could scan the sourrounding area for pyramids or buildings, but they found absolutly nothing that would sugest that aliens are present in the region.\n \n Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret. I mean, NASA is really short on funding, but if it was proven that there was aliens on Mars, then that would mean NASA funding probaly would go through the roof. What better goal could NASA have then to make conatact with extratrestrialls. This must mean that the \"Face on Mars\" is just another mesa. What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding.\n \n So just face the facts. The \"Face on Mars\" is just a mesa that had well placed shadows that are one in a million. So don't be Jeff the astronaut, and just face the facts early on as oposed to having high hopes and dreams just to have them crushed by even more scientifically proven evidence. If you don't remember anything from this article, remember this: don't be Jeff.",

I think that the face on mars is just the background for a couple of reasons. These are my reasons.\n \n First, it is impossible for there to be aleins because there is no water. Every living organism needs water. Another reason why it cannot be aliens is that when they did a close up they didnt find anything. The camera was special because it caught even the smallest of things. For example, if there was some sort of shack, this camera's lens could spot it, as said in paragraph 11. Another reason why i think that this could just be a coincidence is that every planet has oddly shaped landmarks. For example, earth has rocks hat are all placed in a circle in Ireland.\n \n In conclusion, this why I think that this face on mars is just a coincidence and a landmark.

    Essay: "Aliens may or may not be real, but if they were they could not make this. I know this is just a natural landform. Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.\n \n First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.\n \n The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.\n \n The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West.\" Then to prove it even more it says this. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar.\" So that just said that these \"faces\" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.\n \n These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.",

This lead many people to believe that there really was life on mars. Many conspiracy theories formed. People believed now more than ever that life exsisted on Mars.

    Essay: "Some people say that \"The Face on Mars\" is something that was built by ancient aliens, much like the theories that people come up with about the structures on Earth. Some people have even stated that the \"aliens\" could be trying to cover it up by hiding it during the time they take it. Then there are the firm believers that this is just a land mass that consists of the surroundings and resembles a mesa type biome. Since there have been developments over time, showing the different variations of the \"face\" and what it has become over the years. There are different arguements and different points of view, but there are different time periods with different variations of the same thing, so it will be proven that is is a natural land mass, and not a martian made structure.\n \n There is a lot of things that points toward this being a natural land mass and that it is not a Martian made structure, or that the Government is trying to cover it up. One thing that shows that it is a natural structure is when the article states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia...\" This means that there are multiple things like this, but the only things that make this one different is the fact that is has \"unusual shadows\" in it that make it look human or like a structure that was built. After this happened and people got news of it and figured out it wasn't real, the Conspiracy Theorists came out and made it seem like a cover up, but this isn't true, because NASA could have gotten publicity from it, as well as many funds. This mesa is no different from anything that we have in Western United States, there we have many mesas that could look equally as strange, but we don't bother, because we want to believe that there is other life, or that there is something strange going on in other planets.\n \n Over the years, the images of this land mass have gotten more and more clear, and we have come to realize, that no, it is not a face, but it is a large point with shadowy parts in it. From the picture from 1976, it is really blurry, and you can't really tell what it is, which is what got people hopes up and thought it may be a structure, due to the shadows and the formation around it. The 1998 one is a bit clearer, but it still is a bit unclear of what it is or could be, because it does look like it could be something like the Sphinx in Egypt, but with the same formation around it. The 2001 image looks way more clear, and this one shows something completely different than what we expected, it is just a regular mesa, with cracks, dips and shadows, and the same formation around it as before. There is something you can tell about the 2001 picture though, if you look closely, it is the same image as all the others, because you can see the dips in it where the \"eyes\" and \"mouth\" are, just more clear so they don't really show up, and since everything is more clear, you can see the cracks, which could have added to the effect.\n \n Even after all of the theories that were made, and NASA defending themselves, as well as people trying to prove them wrong, and prove that there was something that the government did to cover it up. All of this could still be fought, who knows, there could be life out there somewhere besides on Earth, but as of now, there is no proof, and this image will still remain a natural land structure. Some people are dissapointed by this, others are motivated to keep moving and possibly one day find some signs of life, so maybe humans would be prepped and set in case of disaster. There is nothing wrong with personal opinions, but for the most part and from what pictures and plenty of evidence have proven, this is still no more than a natural occurence do to the way land forms over time. So even though people may keep looking for any signs of something that could be a conspiracy, or you just want to find something \"supernatural\" or strange, but the fact stands that there are many thing like this, and just because it is on a different planet, does not make it anymore special, and it doesn't make it any different.",

You can't just look at an unusual figure then automatically assume that it's something totally different without even observing the details around that object.

Though it's very hard to spot your target in outerspace, the Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine.

    Essay: "In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars when it spotted what appeared to be a likeness of a human face in a region called Cydonia. Over the years there has been speculation that this \"face\" was created by aliens. But over the years new equiptment has revealed the \"face\" for what it is: a mesa.\n \n There are three key points of evidence that disprove the alien theory: the equiptment first used to photograph the Face on Mars is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the sky was clear on Mars when the 2001 image was taken, and Earth has similar landforms on its surface. For example, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" Technology has advanced much from since 1976 and 2001 image is a clear example. The 2001 image also has another detail that can't be left out: it was taken on a cloudless Martian day. A last piece of evidence sure to disprove the alien theory is the fact that Earth has similar landforms on its surface. The Face on Mars, \"...is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\"\n \n To conclude, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens.

    Essay: "The \"Face on Mars\" is a famous landmark on, you guessed it, Mars! Many people believe that it is just a natural landform, but others believe it was created by aliens. Why do people believe that it's created by aliens? Well, they believe that the Face is bona fide proof that there is life on Mars, and NASA is hiding something from us. In my personal opinion, I believe that it's just a natural landform that just happens to look like a face. I think that because I think the odds of aliens creating a face on Mars out of no where is very illogical. So in this essay, I'm going to prove to you that the \"Face of Mars\" is actually a landform instead of an actual alien artifact!\n \n One of the main reasons I believe that it is just a natural landform is because according to the article, mesas are something that is common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. And since the face was located in Cydonia, it wouldn't be out of place for there to be a mesa there. So in the beginning, scientists told everyone what it really was, another Martian mesa, but it was shaped like a face. But many people noted something that was in the article in paragraph 2, where it said that the mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. My explanation for this is maybe the mesa was formed a certain way that made it have these out of place shadows, because not every mesa is alike and some may have different shapes than another. Also according to the article, it notes that very few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact, which means there are someone skeptics among scientists, and sure, scientists may be smarter than the average person, but that does not mean they are always correct.\n \n Now we move along to even more important evidence, the pictures. The pictures are important because if you look at the picture of the \"Face on Mars\" taken in 1976, you could see that it really isn't that clear, but you can make out a face in it. But if you look at the better pictures in 1998 and 2001, you can see that they're a whole lot clearer than the ones in 1976. Right now I'm focusing on the one taken in 1998, which according to the article, it was posted on a JPL website where it was revealed as a natural landform. But skeptics again were skeptic as always, and said that since it was taken during the winter, which is a cloudy time on Mars, that the alien markings of the Face were hidden by haze. My reponse to this is, if there were alien markings, why couldn't you make a brief outline of them in the picture from 1976? And how do you know for sure that there are any alien markings? Many questions arose and taken pictures of the Face became a priority.\n \n 3 years later, on April 8, 2001, another picture of the Face was taken. This one was much clearer than the one in 1998 due to there being no clouds. According to the article, the pxiel size in the image was 1.56 meters, and as rule of thumb, if there were any alien markings or another of that sort, they would've been able to be seen in the picture because of the pixels. So the \"Face on Mars\" was got rid of its skeptics and now many scientists say it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. According to the article, Garvin says it remind him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, because it is about the same height of the \"Face on Mars\".\n \n So in conclusion, the \"Face on Mars\" is a mesa plain and simple, and the main reasons are because of the pictures, and overall the really big reason many mesas are common around Cydonia, which is where the Face is located. Another reason why I don't think that you should believe that it is an alien artifact is, there is so much evidence to why it isn't whenever people just pointed out obvious things in the picture, like clouds of haze covered \"markings\" in the 1998 picture but there weren't ever markings on the mesa as revealed in the next picture taken in 2001. So to end this essay, the \"Face on Mars\" is a mesa, not an alien artifact as many skeptics believe.",

Thats when NASA started reseaching it. In April 5, 1998, it was proven that it was just natural landform. Through the years the face starts cracking and fading away because of the weather. The weather of Mars is usually unpredictable, but usually cold. Also the wind in Mars is pretty commen and it makes the land look like a lot of weird things!\n \n So Mars makes all type of natural landforms and why would aliens make a face in Mars? How?

    Essay: "The Face on Mars\n \n Have you ever seen a landmark that looks like something else? In 1976 a Mars roover named Viking 1 spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. This just hapened to be huge rocks together looking like a face. NASA named this the \"Face on Mars.\" The \"Face on Mars\" has become a pop icon. It has appeared in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! The Face is not a natural landform because it looks exactly like a face, its on Mars which could be an alien, and many roovers have seen the Face when they go to Mars.\n \n The Face is not a natural landform because it looks exactly like a face. How can we not know that it is not an alien. NASA people can't go up to Mars to look at it face-to-face. Roovers can only take pictures of it. Mars is too far away that NASA can't send people up there to make sure it is an alien. There isn't any oxygen up there so people could breathe.\n \n The Face is on Mars, which could be an alien. People have always thought that there were aliens on Mars. This time there actually could be one on Mars. Life on Mars could be a real thing. Mars is a eird place because it is red, unlike Earth which is mostly blue and green.\n \n The Face is a natural landform because NASA has proven that there can't be any life form on Mars. There is nothing that they would be able to eat to stay alive. The planet is red and there isn't any water or anything to drink for them to survive. There is no possible way for any life form to survive on Mars.\n \n There is a natural landform on Mars that looks like a face because huge rocks were fromed together looking like a face. This is all nature, there is no way that aliens could live on this planet. Natural landforms all around the universe. Mountains and hills are all over Earth. Nature takes control of everything that is alive. The Face is a natural landform and not some kind of alien.\n \n The\"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform because aliens can't live on a planet without anything to survive, natural ladforms are all over the universe, and the Face is just huge rocks formed together looking like a face. I strongly believe that this is not an alien, and that this is a natural landform.",

    Essay: "Some people believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is just an alien artifact. Although these people believe this, it is not true. The \"face\" that was discovered on the surface of Mars was really just a mesa. This was proven, when scientists used a special camera to capture what we were really seeing. The camera used showed everything that it captured. It was so clear that no matter what it had taken a picture of you'd be able to tell exactly what it was.\n \n This was a huge attraction to everyone. This topic bacame very popular. The truth was then revealed. The huge attraction, the \"Face on Mars\", was just a landform. Things like this were commonly found around Cydonia, thus proving that things like this are somewhat common in this area. The picture taken showed a butte or a mesa which are said to be commonly found in the American West. It was even compared to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. In conclusion the disception of the \"Face on Mars\" was all just a misunderstanding. The truth was unfolded an now the world knows what the \"Face on Mars\" really was; a mesa.",

    Essay: "As a NASA scientist I know more about how the Face is not made from aliens. First off how would aliens create the face because they probably never seen a human. We never seen any evidence that supports that aliens are real. So how would aliens create the face if we don't have any evidence that they are real?\n \n The face is made from rocks. Rocks like from Mars. The face is just a natural landform nothing else. Since the Face is made from Rocks and is on Mars it is called a mesa. Its basically a huge rock formation eveyone would say, even I would say it. There might have been an ancient civillization there, but we are still finding out new stuff everyday.\n \n Yes the face has been a pop icon. It has appeared in many books, magazines even radio talk shows. Some people even think that it is possible that there is somehow life there on Mars.\n \n You shouldn't believe that aliens really did make the face. We don't have any proof that aliens are even real. So we can't say that aliens made the face. Since there are humans are Earth then there could probably once have been humans on Mars, but we have no clue at all. So far its just a natural landform since we have no proof its made from humans or even possible aliens.",

    Essay: "The Face on Mars was at first just a shadowy likeness of a human face. Yet, as we focused more and more into the Face the more superficial it became. Is it a Martian? Is there life on Mars?\n \n Well, from the evidence given, it is very likely that the superstions are false, and the Face is just a landform.\n \n The Face was captured again on April 5, 1998 by the MOC which gave a sharper photo. That alone was enough proof to show that the Face is just a landform. Even though it was very cloudy around Mars around that time, it would still be difficult to pass over the Face. The MOC scans over the planet with narrow 2.5 km-wide strips which would make it very hard to miss over the Face.\n \n Lastly on April 8, 2001 NASA captured an extraordinarry photo of the Face. It was a cloudless, summer day which squelched all objections of it being too cloudy around Cydonia to capture a good photo. Each pixel in the photo spans 1.56 meters, whereas the best photo in 1976 only had 43 meters per pixel. The photo was so spectacular that you could zoom in 3 times the pixels size, so even if there were life, small shacks, or pyramids on Mars, you'd be able to see them.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landform. the 2001 photo gives enough evidence that even if there were life or monuments on Mars you would be able to see them. The photo in 1998 was also a good photo, so good that it would be hard to even miss over the Face. Also, even if there were life on Mars NASA would have no reason to hide it, it would help their company more than it would be a detriment to it. The article states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West.",

    Essay: "Things aren't always as they appear, just because it looks that way doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The formation on Mars does look like a face but it is just a land formation it's not like land formations are rare. Coincidences happen all the time, this is just one of those times. You can't judge something based on how it's looked, you have to really pay attention.\n \n Formations are a very common thing, both on Earth and on Mars. It is nothing strange, what is strange is that it looks like a head. But even at the picture was taken in 1976 with a much lower quality of camera so things wouldn't have looked as clear as a more modern camera, the other picture was taken in 2001, technology would have advanced and improved much in that time span as it was 25 years later. The quality would have improved so it would have been much easier to see and to know what it really was, it was just a coincidence and coincidences are just as common as land formations.\n \n Coincidences happen a lot, and this is just one of the instances that it happens. It may look like a face and something that was made but when you look at it again, with a different perspective you see what it really is. Like sometimes you will have food, like chips and it will look like a face or an object, but just because it looks like that doesn't mean that is that. Or sometime you will see something, but then have to look again to see if that's really what you saw, it's the same concept. Just because you see it doesn't mean it is that or that is even there. Magic is a good example as it is just an illusion, it's happening in front of you but that doesn't mean it's actually there, because when you see how it's really done it's not so magic. The clouds may look like animals floating in the sky but they are still just clouds. All of this brings it back to the same point, that the land formation may look like a face that was created but when you really look at it and realize what it is you know what it really is, just another land formation.\n \n You may say that aliens made something like this but that just doesn't make sense. That's like saying that people made the Grand Canyon or that people made the Rocky Mountains. These things would have made by what was there and things that affected them, not by people or aliens. There is no evidence that aliens even exist, so with lacking that proof how can you say something that never existed or at least something that is unable to be proved existed made this.\n \n It all loops and loops and loops. You end up with the same thing and it just becomes repetitive. You can say that aliens made this but you lack proof, where as it's just a land mass has plenty of evidence to back it up. It is just a coincidence that it looked like a face.",

    Essay: "I think that the face on the surface of mars is a natural landform. I dissagree that it is made by aliens or any living organism.\n \n The reason I think that the face is a natural landform is because if it was made by aliens then I think there would be more of them not just one. With us humans we have many different statues monuments tall skyscrapers not just one of them. For example the pyramids they we obviously were not naturally made but there are many of them that are exactly the same. So if that was made by aliens I feel like there would be many more that resembled the landform or some other odd landforms.\n \n In the 12th paragraph of the article it says this is a martian equivalent of a Butte or mesa so there are many things that are odd that happned naturlly on Earth also. In the passage Garvin said,\"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of Idaho\". Garvin also said,\"That there is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the face on mars.\"\n \n My next point is that many people say that N.A.S.A\n \n is just keeping secrets of aliens away from the public.

    Essay: "This essay will have many reasons to why the \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural landform created with the use of shadows to form what looks to be, a human face. Some people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens or any kind of life on Mars, and NASA is trying to keep the public from knowing.\n \n The first reason is that it has been confirmed by NASA that the human face is just an illusion! This illusion created by shadows gives it the appearance of a human face. Now some people may believe that NASA is saying that it is an illusion because they want to hide that they have been given a sign of life in space. Most people do not know that if there was life on Mars then NASA would benefit, which I will speak more about in the next paragraph.\n \n The second reason to convince you that the \"Face on Mars\" is just a landform is that if there was life on Mars, it would be no secret! NASA would financially benefit from life on Mars. Think of all the publicity NASA would get and how much money that would bring to them, they could fund a lot more programs and projects.\n \n The third reason is that we can not question the power of the technology they have at NASA. NASA has taken several looks at the face and each time the results are the same. They have extraordinary cameras and photography technology at NASA. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, most common in the American West.\n \n Although some people might still believe that the face is not just a landform, the facts show that it is just an illusion with shadows giving the appearance of a face. I hope this essay has enlightened you to what the \"Face on Mars\", really is.",

Like the many types of different natural landmarks we have on Earth.\n \n We have taken more pictures of the Face on Mars that don't show any evidence of alien life on Mars. The most recent being the one we took on April 8, 2001 on a camera that takes pictures with better resolution that helps us see more then just the Face but also anything else that could be around the Face, like, pyramids, airplanes, and small shacks.

    Essay: "When looking at the Face over the years, you can clearly tell that it's a landform. From 1976 to 2001 the Face has lost almost all features to make it look like a face. For example, in 1976 you could clearly see a nose and eyes. By 1998 you could hardly make out the form of the nose and there was a crack where a mouth would have been bplaced. Finally, by 2001 you could hardly see any of its features. In the following paragraphs I will discuss detalis and characteristics into further detail.\n \n When I took a first looked at the Face, in the photo from 1976, I saw a clear face with a nose, eyes, and the feature of a pharoh.\n \n By 1998 I could no longer see the eyes and nose look caved in. I did however see the form of a mouth that I didn't see before. A martian couldn't make a face out of the ground because nobody knows for sure that they're real. No one has ever seen a martian so how do we know that they're even there? Land however could completely make this. If you look at Earth and the mountains that have been formed, not by man but by the land, you know that there's no way martian's could've built this.\n \n Also, nobody has proof that this isn't just shadows reflecting onto the ground. There might not even be a landform there but the shadows are forming an allusion that makes it look like a land mass. In paragraph 9, Garvin says, \"We don't just pass over the Face very often.\" When Garvin says this, it makes me believe more that it's just a shadow because they don't see it very often. The sun might have to be placed just right to cast the shadows onto that specific spot. Lastly, how would martians know what an ancient pharoh looked like?\n \n Now I'm going to sides with the martian's. If martians were in fact a real living thing, why couldn't they build something to look like a face? I'm sure that they would have hands, fingers, feet, and toes just like humans. If this Face was martian made, maybe they were trying to send a signal to someone like, \"Hey, we really are here and we need your help!\" They could've known that there were space rovers going around their planet from somewhere else. There's no telling who built the Face.\n \n There's no telling how the Face got there or why. The most realistic and logical explanation is that the land formed it. There are many conspiraces out there as to how and why the Face is on Mars. I choose to believe that they had a \"Mars Quake\" and the face just appeared. But in reality nobody knows how it was formed.",

    Essay: "You say that the Face on Mars was created by an alien civilization. However, this is somply not true. The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to a mesa here on Earth. You may think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, but there is substantial evidence to prove otherwise, that the \"Face\" is nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n There is plenty of evidence to support the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation. If the Face were created by an alien civilization, NASA would greatly benefit. Therefore, there would be no reason to hide the information. \"defenders of the NASA budjet wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" (5). The second photo of the Face on Mars was claimed by some to be inconclusive because of the haze created by the winter weather on Mars. However, a third photo of the Face was taken on April 8, 2001 \"a cloudless summer day in Cydonia [the region of Mars where the Face resides]\" (10) tat also clearly shows that the Face on Mars is not a face at all, but simply a natural land formation.\n \n The Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural land formation. \"'[the Face on Mars] reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.

If the ruins of an alien civilization actually existed on Mars, NASA would reap a great benifit, meaning that there would be no reason to hide the discovery. The first picture showing the Face on Mars as merely a natural landform was dismissed by skeptics because the time of year the photo was taken gave the camera a layer of haze to look through to see the face. This haze, skeptics said, hid the alien markings from view. However, this was disproven in April 2001, when a new photo was taken during the clear summertime on Mars. This photo still showed that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to the mesas of Earth.",

There are two things wrong with that arguement. If NASA had discovered new life on Mars, they would most defineitly share it with the public. Everyone would know that there were other lifeforms on other planets, and this would be extremely benificial to NASA. They would get all the funding they need to do more exploration deeper into space. They would get more scientists interested in making technology for space travel. They would get more brave volenteers for space travel. The second thing wrong is the difference between sources of information. All the info people have about the face is either from NASA itself and pop culture like movies or magazines. So if you trust magazines and movies more than a well supplied and well known orginazation like NASA, then you don't have as reliable sources making your own arguement not very believable.\n \n In conclution, skeptics don't have any reliable proof that hasn't been already disproven.",

    Essay: "Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.\n \n Us scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to \"landforms common around the American West\", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" here on Earth.\n \n If that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states \"Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.\n \n If you're still not convinced, look at the picture we took of The Face on April 5, 1998, \"when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time\". NASA got a picture \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\", as stated in paragraph 7. This means that it was much easier to see The Face, and what it actually was. The pictures revealed something amazing... the Face was \"a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" I know, shocking! But these are just the facts. Some argued that is was cloudy that day on Mars, so \"alien markings were hidden by haze\", as it states in paragraph 8. So we took a better picture on April 8, 2001 - an uncloudy day on Mars - showing, again, that it was just a landform. Nothing more to it.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform on Mars, similar to those here on our home planet, Earth. As far as anyone knows, even NASA, there are no life-forms on Mars of any kind that made The Face. As it says in paragraph 12, the pictures we took on April 8 were so high-quality that \"\"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\" If there were any kind of aliens or alien markings on the Face, or creating the Face at that time, you would have been able to see it in that picture. The Face \"is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\", landforms commonly seen here on Earth. That's all there is to it. No aliens. No magic. Just natural happenings, that's simply all the Face is.",

    Essay: "The ways we know that the face is just a natural land form and not something created by Aliens is because we have done real research on the Landform. Not only that but when we took the pictures we used our cameraÂ’s absolute maximum resolution so it would be as clear as possible. Plus the evidence has changed. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. So we know that the planet is changing and thats how we know that the landform isn't created by Aliens. Plus we have a Surveyor which is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. The number one way we know it is a land form and not something created by Aliens is because Â“As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,Â” he added.

    Essay: "I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA.\n \n My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.\n \n My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos! When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\n \n This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien . these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head. Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking.",

I know this because the picture snapped of the face from 1976, was bit blurry, once they got abetter camera the picture became more clear and looked less like a face. Only some of the scientist beleived the face was a 'alien artifact'. There is proof that it is just a landform that looks like a face.\n \n The picture from 1976 was a bad quality picture, it was blurry and you couldnt see much of the real features that were there. Once cameras got better and more HD the pictures got more clear and you could actually see the cracks and the rough parts if the landform. In 2001, the picture was good, it looked less like a face when the cameras got better, but it still had that face effect on it.\n \n Only some of the scientist beleived that the face looking land form was created by aliens, not all. When they snapped the first picture in 1976, some of the scientist noticed the face and the first thing that came to there mind was that aliens did it. They started to go back and capture a picture of the face looking landform. Cyndonia became a priority for NASA when they arrived at the 'Red Planet' in September 1997.\n \n They finnaly figured that it was just a regualr landform that had been created like face, not by aliens but by nature. The picture actually shows is the Martain equivlent of butte or mesa, those are landforms common around the American West. Scientist state that \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\". Also he says \"Thats the lava dome that taks the form of isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars\".\n \n The face on mars could have been crated by aliens though. Aliens cpuld have easily managed the curves and the ways the face looks, the nose, eyes, ears, mouth and the way it was even shaped looked like a alien head. It is very possible for it to be alins who have created this face, maybe it was a sign that aliens are here or asign that aliens know about humas.\n \n Most landforms mostly get created about how the surroundings are or whos there. There is stuff called man made and thats made by human, but no ones ever heard of alien made. Since they used the better camera with better pixels and better HD, it turns out that the face looking lanform on Mars was just another weird looking landform, no aliens, just landform.",

    Essay: "Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.\n \n The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.\n \n Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.\n \n It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.\n \n This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars.",

The higher quality photos don't even show the face, and why would NASA cover up somthing that would help them with their budget issues. Its clearly just rock formation just like ones we have on earth.\n \n First of all the first picture was just a lucky happenstance. When NASA went back in to get a higher quality photo, it wasn't there. The face was just a product of clouds and outdated equipment. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" (P10) The best quality photo, and it looked less like a face and more like a pile of broken dreams.\n \n Some hardcore conspiracy theorists might say NASA was trying to pull a wool over our eyes and cover up the existents of extraterestrial life with fake pictures.

    Essay: "In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit. Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars.\n \n One reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. In paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.\n \n But even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that NASA was trying to cover something up. In spite of the new pictures people said that the day the photo was taken, it was cloudy. Therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate. In fact, these theorists were right. The day the photo was taken was in winter. It says in paragraph 8 that, \" ... it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" These facts show that the landmass could indead be hidden by clouds. However, NASA still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform.\n \n While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,\" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, the face on mars is supported and not supported. NASA has proven with photographic evidence that it is just a natural occurance while conspiracy theorists say that it is a martian civilization. I think that NASA's facts are very believable, and they have the science to back up their claim. I hope that in the future, more people will base their beleifs off of science and not fictional conspiracy theories.",

However, many years later, the Face turned out to be a natural formation, like a mesa is on Earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that the Face is not an alien artifact. Also, NASA has found no other evidence of alien life on Mars, so the chances that the Face is made by aliens go down even more.

This theory is also disproved. Jim Garvin said that it's hard work to get photographs of the area, so why would NASA work so hard to get pictures of the Face if they wanted to hide it? Furthermore, NASA would love to find an ancient alien civilization, and would probably share it if they did find something. Finally, there is one more piece of evidence that the Face wasn't made by aliens. There are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face.

    Essay: "The Face of Mars has proven to be one of NASA's most mystifying cases to ever be solved. Twenty five years ago, as NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, it snapped a photo of a startling image resembling a human face. After releasing the image to the public, many people became fascinated in the \"face\". This rolled the ball for many people to believe there was an ancient civilization on Mars. However, modern technology and expertise of numerous scientists have discovered the face is merely a natural landform. The use of more efficient cameras have diminished any hopes of alien life on Mars.\n \n NASA's Mars Exploration Program has already identified the area on which the face is found as Cydonia. When the face was first seen in the Jet Propulsion Lab, scientists figured it was a Martian mesa, which were common enough in Cydonia. Although it was abnormally figured in the shape of a human face, scientists already knew mesa's were prominent in the area of Cydonia. Also, modern technology, such as a Mars Global surveyor camera, has revealed the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. The camera's absolute maximum resoultion picture ensures that no \"alien markings\" were hidden by haze, as some skeptics argued. In the 2001 image, each pixel spans 1.56 meters, whereas pixels in the 1976 image spanned 43 meters. Therefore, the better camera quality ensures the truth behind the Face on Mars: a natural landform.\n \n Some people argue that, due to the cloudiness on the planet, alien life could have been hidden by haze. However, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor on \"a cloudless summer day in Cydonia\" and captured another photo. Garvin explained \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" Garvin knew if there were any pyramids or shacks, the camera would have been able to capture it and he would have been able to see it. Thus, there is no chance haze could have hidden the aliens. People also argued that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence NASA would rather hide. This is not the case. Authors thought this would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. Therefore, the belief of life on Mars is simply just for the public. It has been in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The Face on Mars was used to engage the public, not neccessariy to inform.\n \n Proven from better camera quality and scientific knowledge, people can know believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If any civilization was there, the Mars Global Surveyor would have been able to seen it. Also, mesa's are common in the Cydonia area, where the face was found. In conclusion, better technology from 1976 proves the Face on Mars is a landfrom, and there is no chance any life on Mars exists based on the face.",

    Essay: "Alien's have been a question many astronauts and people from all around the world have been wondering about for ages. But do they actually exsit? A few years ago NASA discovered what seemed to look like a face on Mar's surface. Many think that the so called \"Face\" was created by alien's. But others think it was just created by natural causes just like how some landforms are created on Earth. How do you think that the formation was created?\n \n So far NASA hasn't discovered any alien markings or any other form of life on other planets. This is one of the reasons why the formation was created by natural causes and not by alien's. Just like on Earth we discover something new every day, such as new landforms and new natural resources. The formation couldn't of been formed by alien's because where did they get the tools to make it? If aliens exsited, i think we would have more evidence.\n \n Alien's don't exsit becuase we would have found some evidence of diffrent life on diffrent planet's by now. If their are no aliens then their are no alien made objects on Mars. Alien's probably would have found a better communication rought then sending us weird landforms that dont have much meaning at all.\n \n Why of all things would the aliens create a face? Even if aliens did exsit i don't think it is their goal in their life to scare us humans. They would probably make something more reasonable, like a house or something like a shelter.\n \n Along with the formation there are also many landforms on earth that are similar. Such as the Grand Cannon and things like that. Think if the humans lived on Mars and we came to Earth and saw the Grand Cannon we would automatically think that there must be life here since there is no other way this could have been formed. Just as we believe there is life on Mars we would assume their is life here. Untill their is more evidence about alien's we should not believe that they exsit.\n \n As it says in the artical \"What the picture actually shows is the Maritian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" This landform represents many of the already discovered landforms on earth such as the Grand Cannon and their is no official evidence that aliens exsit this is obviously a naturally formed landform and not created by aliens.",

    Essay: "I think the Face On Mars is a natural landform because there are other landforms already like it on Earth, and there are other mesas like it around the Cydonia region. I think if aliens were on Mars I think we might have discovered them by now, but you can never be sure.\n \n The Face is just formed by conveniently placed shadows. NASA wishes there was life on Mars becase they would benefit from it, so why would they try to cover up something that could get them a lot of popularity and money. Scientists researched this farther and released even better pictures proving it was just a landmass and not an alien artifact. People believe that the clouds could've covered up alien markings but that seems illogical because in 2001 they went back to the face and took more pictures with even higher resolution and found that there were no markings at all, meaning more evidence leaning towards the Face just being a natural landmass and not an alien artifact. It was just a mesa the whole time.\n \n So there is a lot of evidence leading you to believe that the Face on Mars is merely just a natural landmass called a mesa, combined with shadows gives the mass a facelike texture. Lots of research shows you that the mass is very natural and not made by Aliens.",

    Essay: "The face that NASA found on mars was not made by aliens. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and got better pictures than the Viking did and it showed that there was no alien monument, it was just a natural landfrom. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. Lastly the picture that the Viking took was not very good quality compared to the pictures took in 2001.\n \n One reason that the Face on Mars was not made by aliens is because the Mars Global Surveyor got the best picture of it in 2001 and it just turned out to be a natural landform. In line 11 it says that \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he also added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n Another reason that the Face was not made by aliens is that the face is the equivalent of as butte or a mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 12 it compares the Face on Mars to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n \n The pictures that the\n \n Mars Global Surveyor took in 2001 were a lot more clearer than the pictures took by the Viking in 1976. In paragraph 10 it says that Malin's team captured an amazing picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixal in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixal in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how bad the quality was in the 1976 photo taken by the Viking. Also, it proves that it was not a good photo and that the 2001 photo shows so much more and is way better quality. Other people might say that in the photo of '98, taken by the cmaera on board the MGS had to pear through wispy clouds to see the face, which made the alien markings hidden by the haze. Then the picture or 2001 proved that there was no alien markings and that the Face was just a landform.\n \n In conclusion, this is why I believe that the Face of Mars was not made by aliens and is just a natural landform. First of all, The Mars Global Surveyor got better quality pictures than the Vikning did. Also, the 2001 picture shows that the Face is the equivalent to a mesa or butte, which are landforms that are common in the American West. Lastly, when you compare the '76, '98, and the '01 picture side by side you can tell that the '98 and the '01 pictures are more clear and show that the Face is just a landform.",

Lastly, I will show you how and prove to you with facts of how it was proven to not be aliens who built this face on mars.\n \n First, I am positive of what you said about the aliens creating this face and then the government taking them to area 51, is a lie. The alines weren't the ones to create this face because it was what we like to call the mesa or you can also call it the butte. Anyway, the mesa is like a lot of landforms that we have here in western part of America, just as it states in paragrph 12. Secondly, when people started to make assumptions it was because NASA had not been able to take a clear image. So you can not say that it was the aliens because the rest of the world was sayng it. Thirdly, we really couldnt find it whenever we wanted because it was hard to find. As it states in paragraph 9. ''We have to scan the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips'' said Jim Garvin. so this are some small but really to the point facts so you can have and understanding about the face of mars and so you can stop thinking that it was aliens who created this face.",

    Essay: "Aliens vs. Knowledge\n \n Twenty-five years before 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a landform in the shape of a face on Mars's surface. This, after being released to the media, caused an uprising of speculations. Did aliens make this? Were there other beings on other planets? Are we not alone?\n \n A famous scientist once said that we researched for other life on other planets because humans didn't want to be alone in this vast galaxy. He also said that it could cause either fear or excitement. The media wanted to grab the attention of the common people, and to do that they needed something extraordinary. The media spins the truth to benefit their needs. You can't believe everything they say because all they can do is gain by your speculation.\n \n NASA hardly thought this was the work of aliens. They didn't want the people to think they were lying, they wanted to seek the truth. Even if they were hiding something, they could only ever lose everything for covering it up. More attention on the dying out NASA program would gain the support and money to fund them. So, on April 5, 1998, they sent another spacecraft to take pictures of the landform.\n \n Not everyone thought the image that came up, the one of a landform, sufficed. They argued that it was probably too hazy and that the image wasn't a reliable resource. They said that the haze was blocking the alien markings.\n \n Again, NASA sent another spacecraft in 2001 to take better pictures in different angles. The picture showed a landform much like a butte or mesa here on Earth. Some people stated that it was a conspiracy.\n \n Mars has unique quirks like every planet. Here on earth we have natural landforms such as a mesa, and mountains, and rivers. Mars isn't much different.\n \n Scientists have special catogories for classifying a planet, and Pluto did not meet those requirements. So, every planet has to have at least one thing in common with another. Just beacause Mars is a different planet, doesn't mean that it can't have landforms much like those on Earth.\n \n To say that one planet has aliens because of a landform, is to say that we are aliens as well. Don't we have mountains? Yes, you might say, but it's because of tectonic plates pushing against each other. Science has taught us many things, so now we know something foreign to people back then.\n \n Take Christopher Columbus as in example. Before he sailed the ocean, everyone thought that the earth was flat. After he disproved the theory, people saw the earth for what it was: a round, water planet. Another great example would be Galileo, who disproved the theory that Earth was the center of the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around it. People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is. Now, we don't question on how the mountains were made. We don't question on why we have day and night.\n \n We are more educated now, but there are still things we haven't learned. That's why people should have a more open mind about finding the truth. Once we find the truth, we'll move on to bigger things and so on and so on. This mystery is one which piques people's interest, but turning to myth and false facts isn't the way to go. Exploring and learning from new innovations is what makes scientists who they are. They took the time to go through the process of being a certified scientist. To say you are smarter than one is disrespectful towards them, saying all their hard work was worth nothing.\n \n So, to summarize, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. It was a natural occurence that got blown up into bigger proportions because the media wanted to satisfy their own needs to get profit. NASA knows what they are saying, and we should respect their statements until we ,for sure, know ourselves that the statement is false.",

Scientist from NASA have done futher research on the Face and think that it is a mesa, but others think that the Face was created by aliens. The Face on Mars is simply, a natural landform, and was not created by aliens like some people think.\n \n When the scientist discovered the Face they were very excited because they thought it was something special, but the feeling was short lived. The scientist figured out it was a Martian mesa, which is very common around Cydonia. To better describe the Face would be to say it is: a huge rock formation that respembles a human head. A mesa is a rock formation and rocks can look like all kinds of things, even a human head.\n \n Pictures were taken of the Face in 1976, 1998, and 2001 the resolution on the pictures getting better as technology advances. If one simply looks at the pictures they could tell that the Face is just a rock and it was not alien-made. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original pictures, it was then that the scientist decided that the Face was a rock. The people were still in denial, so NASA set out to get more pictures in 2001. When the pictures came back it was clear that the Face was still just a mesa and was not made by aliens.\n \n At this point the scientist were satisfied, the Face was just a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. One scientist even compared it to things on Earth. Scientist Jim Garvin said, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\". The Face is a mesa that was formed naturally just like a mesa on Earth. They both look the same and were not created by aliens.\n \n The Face that was found on Mars in 1976, was not made by aleins and is just a mesa that was formed naturally. Multiple pictures determined that it just happened to look like a human face and upon closer examination was not alien-made. The Face has been compared to things on Earth like a butte or a mesa multiple times. This proves that the Face was not made by aliens and is a natural Martian mesa.",

Next,it has been proven that the picture of the Face was actually a butte or mesa landform. Also, the other picture that was taken was more visual and it was 3 times bigger than the original. The Face couldn't have been formed by alien life.\n \n One reason that proves that the Face is natural is that there has never been any alien interaction evidence on any planet.

Next,aliens wouldn't know what a face would look like because they wouldn't have a mirror and they wouldn't even know what they look like.

Aliens couldn't have formed the Face if we don't even know if they exist.\n \n Another reason that the Face is natural is that it has been proven that the Face was created by a butte or mesa landform. First,these landforms are very common in the American West. Next,Garvin knows that they are common because he mentioned,\"it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\"Garvin also said that the Middle Butte landform is the same height as the Face on Mars. If the Face is similar to another landform,it is most likely a natural landform.\n \n The final reason that the Face is natural is that the first picture that was taken,isn't as clear as the newer picture. First,when the original picture was taken,it was very cloudy and difficult to see during the winter in April. This could have been mistaken for alien markings because the sight wasn't easy to see. Finally,the newer picture that was taken had a digital image 3 times bigger than the original pixel in the first photo. The newer photo proves that aliens were not around at all.\n \n In conclusion,many people may have thought the Face was formed by aliens,but they only thought that because of the evidence they were given. The original photo was not clear so the newer photo shows what it really looked like. The Face also had similar features to mesa and butte landforms which are very common in many areas. Since there was no evidence to show that aliens were there,it's not reliable to believe. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform that formed suddenly and it can happen anywhere.",

    essay: "The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.\n \n The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.\n \n Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.",

    essay: "When the face on Mars was first descovred from a region of the planet called Cydonia first found in 1976, many people thought it might have been created by aliens. However this is not true, the face on this planet is a natural landform. The face is a natural landform because it is equivalent to a Martian mesa, there were no ther objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.\n \n The face on Mars is a mesa. A Martian mesa is commen around the area of Cydonia. The mesa is only seen as a face because it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The shadows give the rock formation the ilolusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.\n \n There were no other objects seen in any of the pictures that had been taken. Michael Malin's team captured an extraordinary picture using the camers's maximum resolution. \"As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size\" Garvin explaned. So if there were any objects in this picture such as airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even a small shack it would have been seen in the pictures.\n \n There was no alien movement detected on Mars. If it was aliens that created this face the camers's would have picked up the movement and captured pictures. On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time.

It just simply can not.\n \n I belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times. There is basically no evidence that aliens have built this landface.\n \n Well If you still do not belive me and still think aliens have built this landface than I think you are insane because I gave you a bunch of reasons why there is no way and there is no evidence that aliens have built this landface. Everybody should be on my side and say mother nature has built this face, but untill there is prove aliens exist I don't think aliens should be in the topic about this.",

I know you are also thinking that this is crazy, because we all know aliens do not exist. There is no proof of aliens.\n \n It has to be a natural landform, because in the 12th paragraph Garvin said it reminded him of Most Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. Our universe can create anything, just because something look like it was made does not mean it is. There could of been rocks there, and the dust just blows around them. Making it look like it was made, by something or someone. The very most obvious thing is aliens do not exist, there has been no proof of alien. Even to this day in 2016 there is still no proof of aliens.\n \n In the 3rd paragraph NASA even mentioned it as a \"huge rock formation\" scientist are very smart if there was other such thing that made it, it would have already been discovered. Also the face on Mars was a good way to get attention, like paragraph number 5 said so. The face of Mars turned into a famous pop icon. It was on Hollywood films, all the way to Haunted grocery store check out lines. If people could get the public to think that it was aliens that made the face, it would have maybe become way more popular. Plus most people do not believe in such thing as aliens, if they do not have real proof.\n \n My very last example is , if NASA found out was aliens they would have already told the public. It would be huge for NASA to discover aleins. There is no way they would hide the proof that aliens are real. It would help their budget, if they did discover an ancient alien civilization on mars. As it says in paragraph 6 scientist started hunting for more information. It became a priority for them. All the pictures they took revealed it as a natural landformation as it says in paragraph 7.\n \n There is no way it is related to Aliens. So if someone says that NASA is just hiding it, it would be false. NASA would surely reveal that there is aliens on another planet. Just imagine how much attention they would get if they actually discovered it. They would probably be one of the richest people. It is positive that a face on mars, made by aliens is not real.

We dont have any evidence as to seeing or taking pictures of any aliens or UFO's. So why would aliens be on Mars?\n \n Due to the fact that researchers have identified that the \"Face\" is juast a mesa, I think is safe to say that there are no alien life forms on mars and there never was.\n \n Nasa has very good cameras that are way better than the ones in 1976. They can zoom in way more and take 3-D images as well. if there were aliens living on there you would be able to see UFO's and a whole lot of aliens on the planet. And if there were Egyptioan style pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see them to. The \"Face\" is a martian equivalent to a butte or mesa as scientifically proven by scientist.\n \n Another reason as to why the mesa on mars is a landform and not some alien made artifact is that in the article it said that there were shadowns giving off the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. \"Its a good way to enage the public and attract attention to mars\", as said in the story. Also making the Face a pop icon also would make more people think that there really is life on mars without any real evidence. The face appeared on movies and magazines, which made more and more people follow this trend of life on mars.\n \n The final reason as to why the object on mars is just a landform and not an alien made thing is that on a cloudy, wispy day, the photo was taken.

But, scientist took the photo again on a less cloudier day and found out that is was just a landfrom after all. when they shot it with their better camera, it showed that is was just made by mars just like earth makes its own lanforms sometimes. So it seems as though technology from back then just wasnt updated enough to get the job done.\n \n Ultimately, the reason that evryone thought that there were life on mars is because technology wasnt as evolutionized as it was in 2001 compared to 1976.

When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as \"The Face on Mars.\" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.\n \n Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.\n \n On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.\n \n Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture.

Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, \"It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\" showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!\n \n After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.\n \n Another type of reasoning this \"face\" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this \"face\" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the \"face,\" shows that the \"face\" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a \"face\" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.\n \n Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.\n \n So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the \"face\" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the \"face\" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.",

    essay: "The \"face on mars\" is not a real face. The face is a mesa or butte that looks like the ones found in the American west. It looks like a face by the shadows that form on it. The camera that found the \"face on mars\" was old and later a new one took a picture that can clearly see the surface. The new camera cannot be argued with because it is the latest and clearest. Also why would NASA try to hide the fact that there was aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them alot.\n \n The mesa or butte on mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kindof sounds dumb. If you think about it in the way i do it would be lke an alien race looks down on our planet saw a mesa that looked like a face and thought we knew he was there and wanted look at him/her/it.\n \n Also dont you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the \"face\" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock.\n \n If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they was going to wait for a clear day too so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine,and the image is completely real too.\n \n If ther was really aliens on mars it would benefit them alot. Think about it why woul NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollors to study them. Also if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way,because what if they had technolligy we didn't wouldnt we already have it? If there were aliens wouldnt they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war.\n \n The \"face on mars\" is totally fake. Now that ive bestowed upon you my knowledge maybe you can pass it on to other conspiracy theorists. Then maybe the \"face on mars\" thing wil finally blow over. Next time something like this happens you can probably look into that further too. Also maybe just maybe conspiracy theorists might come to an end.",

They could've ruled us by now. The Face is a natural landform on Mars.\n \n To prove that this was not caused by aliens, NASA reported,\" Huge rock formation which resembles a human head that is formed by shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It is all just an illusion. We have seen some illusions in our past lives in space and maybe on Earth. You think that you see a human in the forest, and figured out that it was a tree.\n \n NASA has send an aircraft or a ship that was called Mars Global Surveyor. The camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing an natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all.\n \n So, if you think that is was the aliens, there's the proof. Aliens didn't create a face on Mars. It was just a landform that web surfers and/or NASA saw. Like I said, aliens should have taken over the galaxy. I guess not. I think they are so nice. You see aliens in youtube videos and movies. Some people think that th video was just edit really perfectly to make the aliens real. Why would the government or Area 51 make this a movie? Are they now spreading the word. Some people think it's real by the theories on what happened on the mountain in North Carolina. Some people in think that an alien spacecraft landed on Nevada. I don't know anything about aliens of course.\n \n There it is, the face is a natural landform on Mars. I have proof that it was not a creation from the aliens. I can't say anything now because I'm speechless. I already said whtat needed to be said in the conclusion.

Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.\n \n The only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says \"Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all\". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?\n \n Scientists say that in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West\". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.\n \n But, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. \" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze\". So right now it shows that there could be a possibility that aliens could have made the Face. This one piece of evidence could be the evidence they are looking for.\n \n In conclusion, no one knows what made this interesting Face on Mars. But we do have a lot of information about what could have made it if it wasnt aliens. When we don't have a lot of information here, we can not really think what this Face was made by. All in all we think this Face was made by simple natural landform.",

So we decide to send the picture back to NASA to see what they had to say about it. There replies where so shocking to us we could not belive it they that the face had been created by aliens.\n \n Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this.\n \n Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this. They would not be able to calculate the right measurments and angles also. Plus we dont think they would be able to survive on Mars because of the conditions that are there. These aliens would just have to be out right smart to do something like this. This is just one of those things that seem impossible for an alien to do.\n \n The third and final reason is the point we are trying to get across to you guys and that is that we think is just a natural land form that formed while the planet was being created. If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet.\n \n To wrap up everything about this mysterious face maybe it was created by aliens but we may never know because this face is on a planet where a human would not be able to live and survive to witness the aliens build it. The only people that might have got a chance to witness it is atrounauts that would have been up in space at the time.

As a NASA scientist, I believe that you should know exactly what this historic landmark is, so you know the correct story for years to come.\n \n First, you never know what publicity will do with the next big story. Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. \"Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.\n \n To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. \"....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.\" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.\n \n In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",

I will explain to you why the face was not created by aliens though i will also explain why someone may believe that.\n \n The face is an image we found in 2001 that was taken by our Viking 1 spacecraft that was circling the Mars. The face is an area of land on Mars that has the illusion of a face. The illusion of the face comes from the shadows making the land look like it has a nose, eyes, and a mouth that resembles a human face. It was a surprise for most people here at NASA but we didn't believe it was alien works immediately because we didn't have any real evidence of it. It just so happened to be a patch of land that looked like a face.\n \n We couldn't say it was made by aliens because we needed proof of that and we haven't studied Mars' enough to prove that aliens made the face. We know Mars is similar to Earth but it's still a different planet in our solar system. Although we hoped it might've been an alien civilization, we studied the face more and it was simply a landform similar to a mesa or butte of our world.\n \n Even though we know it was just a landform, there are reasons we could see people saying it might've been made by aliens. We know Mars is able to sustain life because of it's conditions and there has been few deposits of water found there, but we have never found an actual living species on the planet itself. We as humans still don't know if aliens live on Mars or if aliens from other worlds exist at all. Many people believe there are aliens from other planets and some don't really care about the subject at all but it is possible that there's life on other planets.\n \n Because we haven't figured out if Mars has life, people believe the strange and convinient findings on Mars (like the face) are works of alien beings. Although we have confirmed the face was not a work of aliens, we still don't know if aliens exist. We can conclude that the face is not the work of aliens but there just might be unearthly beings on our neighboring planet, Mars. Before we can confirm there are alien beings on Mars, we would need evidence to explain they do exist at all. But we can conclude, the face is not made by aliens.",

    essay: "In 1976 Viking 1 spacecraft was obiting Mars, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sester ship Viking 2. When it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. This face is actually just a common landform. Scientists have taken several pictures of the \"face\", and scientist would benefit from These are the reasons why I believe the Mars Face to be a simple landform.\n \n My first reason is the fact that there are similar landforms like it on Earth and Mars. Such as mesas in the American west. One specific mesa is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. There is also several other landforms like it on Mars. The passage states that \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"\n \n My second reason is that scientists have photographic evidence that it is nothing more than a mesa. April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and His Mars Orbiter Camera team shot a picture ten times sharper then the original photos. Revealing that it was just a natural landform. April 8, 2001, Malin and his team took an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute Maximum resolution. Did you know that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size meaning that if there were objects on the ground we could tell what they were.\n \n Some people might say that NASA would rather hide evidence of life on Mars, but NASA would actually benefit from an ancient civilization. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\n \n These reason are why I believe the Face on Mars is only a natural landform.\n \n There are similar landforms on and off Mars, there is photographic evidence, and NASA would actually benefit from life on Mars.",

    essay: "I believe that the Face is just a natural landform on Mars because no one has any reall proof that it is made by aliens and the astronauts might have just gotten lucky and taken the photo when the shadows were in the right place.\n \n I think that there is no proof that aliens made it because even NASA said that is was just, \"A huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,\" I believe that this quote means that not even NASA thinks that the Face was formed by aliens they just believe that it was just shadows on the rock. Another example from the text that makes me believe that it wasn't made by aliens is that, \"People think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars,\" I believe this supports the claim that there is no proof of aliens because if there was then NASA would have already put in the papers so that could get money to go and explore Mars but, since they haven't put out any information about Mars obviously they haven't found anything to prove that there is life on Mars.\n \n The second reason I believe that it was not aliens who made the face is because the astronauts might have just taken the photo when the shadows were in the right place. I believe this because the text states that, \"What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West,\" I believe this piece of evidence supports the claim because it proves that the shadows were only causing an illusion there was not eyes, or nose, or mouth they were only shadows that were in the right place. The second piece of evidence that I believe supports my claim is, \"\n \n Scientists figured it was just another mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh,\" I believe this supports my because even the scientists believe that it was only shadows that made it look like the rock had eyes, nose, and a mouth.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that the Face is not made by aliens because there is no proof it is made by aliens and the astronauts might have just taken the picture while the shadow made the rock look like a face.",

The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA said it was a \"huge rock information\" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it. You got to study the artifact before you can assume it is from aliens.\n \n After that, you got to be able to back up your answer , and saying why it is not a face. \"Thousands of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform.\"\n \n People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars.\n \n In conclusion, the artifact could have just been hit by a rock. People need to belive most things that are not really true.",

    essay: "First of all, NASA only gets their information from research and cameras which they depend on to help them with their research too. According to the text it states,\"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible. To add to that it has been twenty five years since the discovery, and there is not a for sure explanation that is logical because some people think there is smething behind it.\n \n Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. According to the text it says,\"Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.\" Even scientists believed it too and NASA has logical thinkers in their coorporation too.\n \n Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,\"Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped.\n \n Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about. Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life?\n \n In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.",

Have you ever wanted to travel to Mars known as the, \"Red Planet?\" Mars has a long history, however some NASA scientists say that in 1967 they saw a face on Mars and some people thought that aliens created it.\n \n Twenty-Five years ago from this date May 24, 2001 a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars taking pictures of possible landings for the sister ship named Viking 2. As the spacecraft was circling around the planet Mars, it saw something very odd which was, shadowy likeness of a human face with and enorumous head nearly two miles from the end it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on the red planet called Cydoina.

    essay: "Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.\n \n First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people.\n \n Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.\n \n Of course, people still weren't satisfied. Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face. After extensively studying the pictures, Jim Garvin states that it \"is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\". He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West. The Face is just a regular landform.\n \n In conclusion, that is why the Face is just a natural landform.

But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory.\n \n In 1998 on April 5, for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. A picture was captured 10x better than the orginal viking photos. they were later posted on a website for the public to see but for the people who thought it was a sign of life on Mars, they were wrong. Scientist's said it was just a natural landform.\n \n For the second time, the scientist could yet again reach Cydonia once again to turn their conspiracy theory to fact. Others back on Earth said it was too windy and it made the clouds affect the picture. This time researchers used a maximum resolution camera to prove the theorists wrong. Yet again Garvin said, \" If there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were.\"\n \n Scientist said that the \"face\" was equivalent to a butte or mesa.

    essay: "So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.\n \n My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.\n \n My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?\n \n The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. \"It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Garvin. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.\" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.\n \n My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?\n \n This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.",

The text states \"...formed by shadows...\". Tv and other things are what is drawing the attention to the matter andthey are whats broadcasting to the world that it is real. The text states \" It starred in a hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines, radio talk shows...\"\n \n This brings me to the conclusion that infact it is not real but was made real by televison and other things. People just dontt wanna listen to the since behind it. If it where in fact real it would benifit NASA.",

    essay: "Many people, including nasa, believe that \" the Face\" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.\n \n First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.\n \n Secondly, the only reason it \"has\" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.\n \n Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.\n \n Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.\n \n Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",

    essay: "Is There Really a Face on Mars???\n \n The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).\n \n When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.\n \n Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).\n \n Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.",

    essay: "Have you ever heard about the face on Mars? A lot of people have. NASA sent the Viking one up into space to try and capture pictures of mars. The Viking was taking pictures when it noticed a shadowy figure. Can you guess what that figure is? Conspiracy theorists have their own vision of what it was made by, but NASA's scientists had the facts about it!\n \n In paragraph two it says, \"The sensation of the face was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.\" The conspiracy theorists think otherwise. The conspiracy theorists think that the face was made by Aliens. They also think that the face was really think that it was made by Aliens, and that NASA knows it was, but they just do not want to reveal it. Conspiracy theorists think it's Bona Fide, and that it's evidence of life on Mars. This all shows that the conspiracy theorists have different points of view than the NASA scientists do.\n \n In paragraph seven it says, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting then the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" When scientists put the image out online not everyone was satisfied with what the scientists said. Conspiracy theorists still think that it was made by Aliens. This shows that the scientists at NASA have facts and that the conspiracy theorists have only a picture.\n \n In paragraph eleven Garvin says, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects in this picture like aiplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" In paragraph twelve it says, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" Garvin added, \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" This shows that NASA thinks that the face was just a natural landd form. Everyone else thinks that it was made by Aliens.\n \n In paragraph eight it says that the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Now everyone is saying, \"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" They all think now possibly they were made by Aliens. This shows that we may have made a serious mistake in how the face was made. The face could've been made by both natural forming or by aliens.\n \n In conclusion, the face could have been made by Aliens and we just do not know it. We could have been wrong for all we know! So we need to think to not doubt ourselves. We all need to think, was the face really made by aliens? It could've been! We need to learn to work together on our theories not against each other. Just think if NASA would've worked with the conspiracy theorists then we could've figured out what really made the face on Mars!",

    essay: "I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a \"messa brutte\" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there. This is why I degree with whoever says that aliens formed the face on Mars.",

    essay: "The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.\n \n The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.\n \n Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.\n \n The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",

    essay: "The \"Face on Mars\" has since become a pop icon.\" NASA discovered the face, on Mars, when they took a picture of it in 1976. Some people believe that the face is real and some don't. Although, it might look real, it is just a messa. So far they only have older pictures of it, they also have confimed it a messa, which is common on Mars. A cheif scientist for NASA said it reminded him of Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho. Therefore, if the Face was real then why haven't we gotten more pictures of it.\n \n In contrast, they only have older pictures of it. Very few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian Messa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" However, people thought it was a real face. When the picture went online or on TV, people thought it was \"bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars. Even though some people are defenders of NASA, we still shouldn't give them money to see if there is an actual ancient civilization. If we do we could possibly be putting that money to waste. We should think about if the pictures are real or if they were photoshopped.\n \n However, NASA has confirmed it a messa. Which is a natural landform. Since it is windy or cloudy on Mars this messa could have been pushed around to make it look like a face. Even though we got pictures we would still be able to see things like airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks. We could have actually seen those on the ground. NASA dosen't even pass over the face that often. In contrast, we would not be able to get much information on it. So we should not even worry about how to figure out what it is.\n \n Therefore, when scientists Jim Garvin says it reminds him of \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" we should think about how is he right. When a scientists says something big and important we are listening and comparing something on Earth to Mars means that it could have been caused by erosion. Even though we are just getting pictures of it isn't enough. We could have better pictures now then they did back then. In conclusion, erosion and plains on earth come naturally. We have no idea what that could be made of it could be made of, sand for all we now.\n \n Therefore, we may have confirmed pictures it is a face. But do we have pictures that it is not just darker sand. The face could be anything on Mars. Because their pictures confirmed it a messa, it is a natural landform. In contrast, it formed naturally. Just like how it looks like Middle Butte in Idaho. Which was formed naturally. If this gets people saying that their could be life on Mars we probably would have found it by now.\n \n All in all, if the face was real then why don't we have more advanced pictures of it. NASA only has older pictures of this so called \"Face\", it looks like a natural landform in Idaho. So next time NASA gets people crazy about another ancient alien civilzation, think about how they need to prove it.",

    essay: "Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.\n \n First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?\n \n NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.\n \n If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.\n \n Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",

If it was created by aliens then NASA would benefit from discovering life on a different planet, so that shows that everyone in NASA is sad that we didn't find life. Landforms created from nature shouldn't be lied about just to get attention. That is why we don't tell other people a lie when it is just a landfrom like the Grand Canyon. Here are also reasons how I know it wasn't created by aliens.\n \n Some rock formations on Earth are created by wind chipping off peices until one day the rocks are completely gone. We didn't have any control of the winds that created the rock formations, so that shows that nothing living created it. Around the face is other landforms that were created the same way the Face was made. The Face is the only one that people pay attention to becuase it looks like a face, but if you look at the entire picture you can see that other landforms are there that might not look like a face, but they show that landforms are created naturally there.\n \n These examples show us that these landforms were not created by aliens, but by the weather that accurs there. That is why we shouldn't lie just to get attention and make everybody believe something that isn't real. This concludes that the Face was only created by weather like the landforms on Earth.",

The face was found in the region of the red planet called Cydonia. It is very hard for NASA to get the picture because they have to angle the satalite just right. I am not trying to be pestimistic but, NASA has seen landforms on Mars before and the article says,\"the mouth, nose, and eyes are allusions caused by shadows\". The facts just dose not add up to their being life on Mars.\n \n This face is just a landform. There are many ways this landform could have happend. For example, a duststorm, astroids crashing on the planet, or underground volcanos. These are all examples of how the face could have been created. The article says it was caused by butte or mesa. Time for everyone to come up with a new theory!\n \n This face was found in the area Cydonia. One day the aircraft Viking 1 was circaling the plant and found the face. Could you imagine the scientist face when the aircraft reported it back. A few days later they released it to the public. Lots of people were confinced that it was caused by some kind of lifeform, but really it was not.\n \n It was hard work for NASA to get the picture because they had to rotate the aircraft at 30 degrees. This was not easy because if they went to far Nasa would miss the face. If they did not go all the way around Nasa would still miss it . It had to be perfect. It could have been 29 degrees, one of, but it did not matter it would still miss it. It had to be perfect. NASA finnaly got the picture and proved that there was no lifeform.\n \n The nose, mouth, and eyes are caused by shadow illusions. They might have been formed by astroids crashing there, but are most likely shadow illusions. These illusions are caused when the Mars acsis are tillted a certain way and the sun hits it. This is most likly how the shadow allusion happened. This is what scientist says caused the illusion.\n \n In conclusion there were many ways for this landform to happen. Do not think this was caused by some kind of life form because there is not enough proff. There are many ways this could have been formed. For example. A dust storm, or underground volcano the list goes on. It may never be solved what caused it. Just face it it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.",

The cameras in 1976 were not very clear, as you see they have a 43 meter span per pixel, which makes the picture a whole lot more blurry. Even though it's been seen all over the world as an unknown landform or an alien artifact, the evidence has been seen through, and the face, is, well, not really a face at all.\n \n The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars. Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001. Yet the picture doesn't depict an Egyption face staring back at you, but a standard, normal, everyday, Mars mesa. The pictures of the face in 1998 showed clearly that the face wasn't quite a face, with a camera 10 times sharper than the original Viking camera, yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars. Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time. The cameras' span was 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the Viking's 46 meters per pixel, and the planet of Mars was as clear as the eye could see at that time, but there was no unnatural objects to be seen. Yes, it is hard to prove that the famous mesa isn't man-made, you would have to be on the planet to do that, yet the facts and research is all here and it's time to let go.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars has been very iconic on what it has done to the people, and the world as a whole. It's been analyzed and researched over, over, and over again. And it all comes down to the cold hard facts, which all points to the intriging rock of 1976 of being just a rock formation that was, well, lets just say, for now... misunderstood.",

    essay: "Many people believe that \" the Face\" on Mars is actually a alien of some sort or a human. I can truly convince you why it's not a alien, it's only a landform. I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.\n \n First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. \" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.\n \n Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts. Many would say that the aliens didn't want us to knw they exist but the article states it could have been a person going to Mars. Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.\n \n Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there. Some sort of creature may have made it and they would give us evidencce of life on Mars.\n \n You never really know if there may be some sort of living organim on Mars unless you study it closer. Either I may be correct and it just being a landscape made from a storm or I could be wrong and its a living organism. We will never know unless we do the research.",

    essay: "For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even \"alien\" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, \"aliens\" have done so.\n \n In 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.\n \n To conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform. But in reality, no one has the facts to prove that an alien life-form had created this landform. No one has the facts to prove there are alien civilizations on Mars. I only say this because there has not yet been facts, or any information involving alien-life forms or ancient civilizations on mars. Maybe in the future, there will be signs of some type of life-form on Mars, or very odd, peculiar objects that we may find somewhat weird, or, out of the ordinary. It is only, but a matter of time before NASA does find something very odd and out of the ordinary, on any planet, in our solar system.",

But i personally think it's just a landform cause by many things . After a while we had shot a ten times sharper picture than the orginal one . Revealing a natural landform there was no alien monument after all . But the other scienctist still was satisdied for what he belived in but as i was telling him that if there were some type of face or alien we could have seen by the picture we had tooken just as we could see if there were objects like ariplanes on the ground or even small shacks , you could see what they were.

    essay: "I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the \"face\" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.\n \n The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.\n \n Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing. One scientist said that if there where buildings or aircraft on the surface that cameras would show if it was real or fake.",

    essay: "It is just a face. The Face on Mars is natural. This is evident because it is similar to the landforms here on Earth, and there is no sign of alien or human life.\n \n One may argue that it is possibly a sign of alien life on Mars. They might say that the fact that it does look like a face could mean it was aliens who made it. Maybe they'd argue, \"The timing wasn't right. You can't see all the details.\" At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural.\n \n This Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientists have even compared it to buttes and mesas here on Earth. An example of this comparison was by Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. He said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho stating, \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\" Also, Mars is known for being a very dusty and rocky planet. It would be very easy for the formations of Mars to erode together and make such a landform as this.\n \n In addition to it just being a natural landform, there is absolutely no evidence of life near this area or anywhere else. This goes to show that it can't be man/ alien made. The NASA scientists, are using the highest quality cameras in technology today. They zoom in to 1.56 meters per pixel, allowing them to see every little detail. After doing this they found no shelter, no water, no life showing any forms of a civilization. There has never been any life, outside of maybe bacteria, found on Mars, and even if there was, NASA would quadruple their funds after that kind of discovery giving them no reason to hide it.\n \n The Face of Mars is simply a natural landform similar to a butte or mesa similar to those on Earth, with no alien interaction. There is no evidence to say otherwise, and a lot of evidence to back these statements.",

On that fact if NASA did see any aliens on Mars they would have kept it top secret and wold have not showed the images to the world. Not saying its true but if NASA had shown an alien on Mars the world would freak out and we wold destroy each other.\n \n Now tell me if you seen an alien on Mars what would you do?\n \n All I am saying is in 1976 if aliens did make that face then why are we still here? Why haven't the aliens came yet ? Because if aliens were to make that face on Mars then that means they seen NASA's cameras circling their planet so they would've found a way to get them down. But I think it's a big pain in the butt to the people that think thier is alien life on a planet in our Solier System.\n \n I also want to no part in this discussing because if you don't want to belive me that is on you to look crazy if front of the world so do what you think is best about it I have to get to back to work.",

Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Â“MalinÂ’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameraÂ’s absolute maximum resolution.Â”\n \n That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.\n \n Â“huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â”\n \n This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. Â“huge rock formation....\" It basically says that the rock is a formation \".......giving the illusion......\" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth.

Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...\"over time it transformed .....\" in the text... \"Huge rock FORMation.\" It is just a rock thats looks like a face, and just because it's on mars don't mean a thing.",

    essay: "Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a \"shadowy likeness of a human face\". Shadows on the object give \"the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.\n \n In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.\n \n The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.",

    essay: "There are a variety of perspectives and opinions related to the Face on Mars. Many say that it's simply a lava dome, or that it could just be a strange rock molded in such a way where it may appear to be a face. However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.\n \n This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures. They thought of many different possibilities to why this was formed in a way that reminded us of an Egyptian Pharaoh such as the possibility of the camera's angle, the shadows covering it. Basically we thought of everything minus the chance that it may have been the works of such \"aliens\".\n \n Aliens have been the illogical reasoning to many things we find on the various assortments of planets so hearing that this recent discovery was blamed on aliens isn't very shocking. We spent a few days deciding whether or not to show the images captured to the public, but in the end we decided to do so. The Face on Mars instantly became a well-known subject all over the world things such as movies, magazines, and even radio and tv talk shows all spoke of the mysterious Face on Mars.

However that's the thing, there are no statistical facts simply a load of different conspiracies made from people who strongly believe in such things! Considering there is lack of proof on even the stance that aliens are real the \"case\" was never thoroughly thought through.\n \n There can be various reasonings and opinions about the Face on Mars and though they may be very amusing or interesting to hear, the reality of it is really that it is simply an isolated lava dome. This isn't the first time that natural landforms have represented such things as faces or even common artifacts.

This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years.

    essay: "Many have claimed that the human face found on Mars is an alien artifact, but how certain are they. According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.\n \n Some might believe that the so called \"alien artifact\" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth.\" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The passage also claims that the image reminds him of the \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" and that the Face on Mars is about he same height of an isolated mesa- which is a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude during the winter of April 1998. This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they \"photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it.\" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.\n \n As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the \"camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,\" and according to skeptics, \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that \" It's not easy to target Cydonia,\" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is \"bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.\n \n In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Others may disagree, but it is all about your interprutation on the topic, and hopefully the evidence used to support my claims did just that.",

    essay: "The face on Mars has been said to be created by many things. \"Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\"(paragraph 5) Other people believe that it is a natural landform. It could have been aliens, but we have yet to find life on Mars. The reason that makes the most sense as to why its there is that it is indeed a natural landform.\n \n Sure the land may look like a face but it is simply a natural landform. It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too. They are common around the American West. These are called buttes or mesas, and buttes are simply \"a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.\"(paragraph 12)\n \n This landform even reminds people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976. And lastly in 2001, it just looks like a simple mesa, no face, no alien markings.\n \n I do realize that it might make sense to you and other people that it could be made by aliens. But we have yet to find actual life on mars, let alone have it be made by non-existent creatures. This object object may seem extraordinary, but it is simply just a mesa on a planet we haven't even found running water on. I would love to say \"Yes, this was actually made by aliens!\" but sadly I cannot because it is simply just a landform.\n \n Therefore it could not have been created by aliens because these landforms appear on Earth. It looks similar to landforms on Earth. It also has been photographed many times over the years with better cameras each time. Scientist can gladly say \"This is only a landform, in fact these also appear on Earth as mesas or buttes.\" In conclusion, this is just a natural landform that was not created by other-worldly beings on Mars.",

Many things could be the cause of the face on Mars, but I'm sure it's not aliens. Scientist have not proven that aliens are even real yet. If aliens were real scientist would know about it, and they might try to capture one. The face would of been causes by wind, the spacecraft, or it could of been a natural landform.\n \n The face on Mars could have been caused by the wind. When planets rotate it could have cause some wind, and the wind could start to form piles of dirt. The dirt could have been moved into the shape of a face. The shadows give it an illusion of eye, nose, and mouth. The face didn't have any footprints around it so aliens couldn't done it. On Earth the wind blows, and pollen from one flower goes to another. Dirt on Mars could of blew to one area, and it could form a face.\n \n Spacecrafts flying around Mars could have cause the face to appear. The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big. When the scapecraft takes off it could form the face because when air is blown out it leaves a mark. A spacecraft couldn't have left a mark by the face. The fuel on the spacecraft could of left a mark after blasting off Mars.\n \n The face on Mars could be there naturally. It is the third planet from the sun. If there's any volcanoes; lava can explode out of it. Aliens wouldn't come out, and randomly make a face to scare people. The face on Mars must be natural because I don't believe that aliens are real. If aliens are real we probably would have seen one by now. Aliens can't be alive; if they were alive they would have to find food sometime.\n \n However, the face could be have been maded by aliens. I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before. aliens could be able to fly, and they don't have to touch the ground. The could pick up the dirt, and place it where ever they want to form the face. Inconclusion I still don't believe in aliens, but something had to happen to Mars. It could of been a natural landform or it could of been a spacecraft flying around Mars. They world may never know how the face was created, but I'm positive that aliens didn't create it.",

    essay: "Do you ever wonder if the face on mars is just a landform? I've thought about it and I have read this story called \"Unmasking The Face on Mars\" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.\n \n When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption \"...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth.\" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This \"face\" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.\n \n Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage \"It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.\n \n Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that \"the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.\"(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.\n \n After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars\" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all.",

It also said that NASA said \"a huge rock formation which forms a head, eyes, nose, and a mouth.\" So everything is made out of bunch of rocks. Michel Malin and his Orbiter snapped the picture ten time bigger than the original picture in 1998. So then it revealed a \" natural landform.\" Theres nothing special about. It's was just land.

Also, in Earth, there are many landfroms that looks like things. Like Middle Butte in the Snake River. And it is almost the same size as the Face on Mars.\n \n Just because it's on Mars doesn't mean it made by aliens. It's made out of natural. Sometimes strange objects appear around the Earth.

    essay: "The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.\n \n The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of \"The Red Planet\" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.\n \n The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. \" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken.\" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.\n \n Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.\n \n Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity\n \n My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa. The mesa on the planet is only a natural landform that happens to look like a face. Nothing more and nothing less.",

In paragraph 5, conspiracy theorists claim the \"Face on Mars\" is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide. In paragraph 3, NASA unveiled the image for all to see in 1976. The caption noted, \"a huge rock formation...which resembles the shape of a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars; which it certainly did just that. The authors of the article wanted to attract attention towards Mars and NASA even claimed that it was a huge rock formation in the caption. Later, stating that shadows gave the huge rock formation the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper and clearer than the original Viking photos. The picture taken in April of 1998, would most likely not have shadows to give illusions of the face, nose, and mouth. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. NASA again stating and proving that the \"Face on Mars\" was just another out of place natural landform on Mars. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Here again we can see NASA trying to prove that the \"Face on Mars\" in still just a weird natural landform on Mars. Someone who stills believes that the \"Face on Mars\" is the work of aliens might say something like this. The \"Face on Mars\" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim. However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001. The photo taken in April 2001, the weather was perfect-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The photo taken that year still looks like a natural landform on Mars.\n \n The excellent reasons stated above prove yet again that the so called \"Face on Mars\" is just a natural landform.

    essay: "About twenty five years ago from 2001, there was an object found on Mars. When our Viking 1 was scanning the planet to find a safe place for the next space craft to land, Viking 2, Viking 1 suddenly \"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" The scientists at first, were excited, but then we realized that it was probably a common Martian mesa. We just assumed that \"this one had unusual shadows.\" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.\n \n Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.\n \n Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was \"winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.\n \n Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a \"cloudless summer day.\" \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,\" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution. As Garvin went on to add, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" Garvin stated. The Middle Butte is about the same height as Face on Mars. These things are so similar, it is almost impossible to think that the Face was created by aliens.",

This natural landform may appear to look like a face, but why?\n \n The landform looks like a face becuase of the shadows that hit the landform in certain areas. \"... this... had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (2).\" It makes it look somewhat like a face. \"...a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth (3).\" Another reason why the landform looks like a face is becuase our eyes, that play tricks on us, may make it seem real that it is a face. Such as illusion that make it appear that the landform looks like a face that is staring up at the camera on Mars. Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact.\n \n \"...Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origional... photos... when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no monument at all (7).\" \"What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West... That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12).\" So the landforms that you are seeing are actually common along the American West. They don't just pop up out of nowhere. They have been seen before. It's not like it is a first thing that scientists are just discovering.\n \n This evidence proves that there is no alien monument on Mars, it may appear to look like it. But scientists have proved that it is only a natural landform, created naturally, on Mars. Not an alien monument that was created as a sign by aliens on Mars.",

    essay: "Why does NASA consider the \"Face of Mars\" to be a natural landform? They claim that the \"face\" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.\n \n Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed \"haze\" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.\n \n In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called \"alien face.\" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the \"alien face\" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.\n \n On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure \"resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face of Mars\" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",

    essay: "The face of Mars is a landform that looks just like a face. Even though it looks like a face, it has been proven that it is just a landform and if you zoom in on it, you can tell that it isnt manmade. There are landforms on Earth that look just like the face too.\n \n Scientists have zoomed in on the picture and have proven that the face of Mars is just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Butte's, or mesa's, are landforms common around the American West and are also on Mars. The face of Mars is just a really odd shaped butte and people have mistaken it for alien structures. The face also kind of looks like a butte called Middle Butte in Idaho. People have also said that the face looks about the same height as the Middle Butte in Idaho.\n \n The people at NASA had the first pictures of the butte zoomed out enough that it looked like a face. The NASA camera that takes pictures of Mars is in a wierd position so it doesnt pass the face that much and when it does, its not very close so when they zoom in, the pixels are too big to see. When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.\n \n Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up. Landforms can have all kinds of shapes and the face of Mars just has a very unique shape. In conclusion, the face of Mars is just a odd shaped Butte.",

    essay: "Do aliens really exist and are they capable of doing something like this? I don't think they could but if they were capable of doing something like this. We will need some proof to stand with this. There is 3 reasons why this is just a natural landform. They can just be like any landform on earth, a face like this can happen anywhere else, and if you believe in aliens are they really capable of doing something like this?\n \n The first reason why this is just a natural landform is because it can also happen on earth. For example, this can happen upon natural sources. Such eratation and it can just be a mesa. Another example is, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough round Cydonia\"(2). If this is common than most likely it wouldn't be made by any alien. My last example for this is, most landforms have ways it can look. The landforms can happen anywhere and that wouldnt mean it was caused by an alien. If something like this happened on earth most people would think it was caused by natural thigs like the weather.\n \n My second reason is that things can happen anywhere. For example, another planet my have this but that doesnt mean an alien went and left it there so we could find it. If an alien did this we would be able to find something almost the same as this face. Another example is, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars\"(5). This can be true but if it was an alien wouldnt they do a face they new or reconized. Lastly, in the passage it states that \"There was no alien monument after all\". The picture clearly showed a landform not an alien made monument. In conclusion, things like this can happen in different forms but nobody has proven it was made by an alien.\n \n My last reason for why this is not an alien made monument is because there is no proof that aliens made it. For example, have aliens been proven to exist. No proof was every made that aliens exist in the planet mars. Secondly, how could they build such a thing. if aliens built it than there must be a great amount of them that we did not know about. Lastly, if aliens aready built a Face on Mars why can't they do the same thing on Earth. there is no explanation of they wouldn't be able to do this. In order for the aliens to make something like this that would mean they are capable of this and more but they still haven't been proven to exist.\n \n In conclusion, the face could have been made by something other than aliens. The three reasons explaining why it couldn't have been aliens is it could have been done by nature, it can happen somewhere else, and are aliens capable of this. This can prove that aliens didnt build it, that it could have been made by different things.",

    essay: "The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.\n \n There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.\n \n If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.\n \n They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.\n \n While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.",

    essay: "I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform. It may look like a face but it is really not. What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away. So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad. It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.",

Although it might not of happened how I explained, there might of been another way of life its self on the moon. I think it could of been a rational way, but we will never know untill the end of time. As if there was life created on the earth just the same way a little time ago.

In the top picture over time you can see it erode away, especialy the 1998 photgraph.\n \n Thirdly, We see things that look like faces everyday, wether its clouds or land formations.

In the picture, yes we can see some definition but its still just a land form. For example the man in the moon, it looked like a face but wasn't.\n \n On the other hand, it might be.

As a scientist we are constantly getting information from people about their thoughts on the Face on Mars. We get many suggestions, such as the face being created by aliens. Well as a scientist I'm here to tell you it was not created by aliens.\n \n This face on Mars was not created by aliens, but was created by nature itself. The Face on Mars is a natural landform. I know this because as a scientist of NASA we believe this face is just a huge rock formation. This rock resembles a human head. The human head formed by shadows, giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and lastly a mouth. Many authors that have researched on this topic believe it will attract more attention to planet Mars.\n \n The Face on Mars has became a very big deal. It has played a role in movies, showed up in magazine articles, and has been a topic on radio talk shows. Many people have come to conclusion that NASA would rather hid information about this such thing. But NASA just wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\n \n Many people still believe that this artifact came for aliens, but few scientist and have come to believe this is true. NASA takes pictures of the Face on Mars but many aren't satisfied by the quality of the pictures. As a scientist at NASA it is very challenging to capture a good photo because this face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude. This means that the camera has to peer through many wispy clouds to catch the face.\n \n We scientist at NASA have come to conclusion that this Face on Mars isn't created by aliens because of those reasons. Although many others may disagree and believe NASA is hiding information on this artifact. As a scientist that works for NASA, we will continue to look more into this specific topic and hopefully be able to know for a fact that this is created by landform and not aliens.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars is a natural landform and not something that was created by aliens. The Face is a natural landform because the sharper pictures that were taken after the Viking photos revealed that it was a natural landform. Secondly, the scientists had taken another photograph which helped confirm what exactly the Face was. Also, the text states that the Face is \"equivalent of a butte or mesa.\" Although some people think that the Face was created by aliens, there isn't enough information to support that claim.\n \n First of all, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia in 1998. According to the passage, they \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" This means that this camera probably caught eye of more objects and got a more detailed idea of what this formation looks like. The Viking photos weren't as detailed, so the people who saw those photos originally got the idea that aliens had created it. The picture that was captured had revealed that this was, in fact, a natural landform.\n \n Secondly, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to Cydonia on a cloudless day, since some people were second-guessing if the picture was accurate or not. According to the text, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,\" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.\n \n Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said \"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars, is it really what NASA says it is? The Face on Mars is really what they say it is;a face on Mars. Most belivers in the alien world believe that aliens did do it, while most scientist do not. I am a scientist at NASA working on the \"project\" and most scientist believe that it was just a giant mesa or a \"mountain\" or something that was formed by natural effect.\n \n I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that. In April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia, for the first time ever, and snapped a very \"sharp\" picture of the \"site'.\n \n Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.\n \n The belivers in aliens were still not satiisfied on the image they had seen on the internet due to the weather that day. Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the \"reasearchers\" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.\n \n After they had gotten the second picture they \"blew it up\" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids. The picture acutally showed that it is the, Martian equivalent, size of a buttle or (a. k. a. a mesa) which are landforms most commonly made by nature in the American West.\n \n \"It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Gavin. \"Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n I hope this has convienced you to believe that the picture is real and that aliens did not build it and that the pictures and people that have spoken told you that it is just a natural landform that was created by \"mother-nature.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars became very interesting in the time when it was found. The day the picture was taken was a very shodowy day, as it is said in the article the photo was taken in April a usual cloudy day in Mars. The camaras back then focused less than what our camaras do now. On April 8, 2001 when the picture was taken again it was summer and a cloudness day in Mars. When they saw the picture it was just a mesa. You have to understand that the time has pased and camaras have changed so in 2001 the camaras were better. So later on we can understand why because of the clouds that especific moment the mesa could of looked like a face.\n \n Now that you have learned that it was all just that the camaras back then were a little blury, now you have to now that the Face on Mars was just a natural land form. First the article states that mesas or a butte are also just a common land form. This kind of landforms are also found in the earth around the American West. The whole Face on Mars was just caused by a natural process in Mars, by the weather. So now you have learned that all of this was a natural process of a masa that day they took a picture and it happend to look like a mans face.\n \n After all of this research that scientist have found, we have all learned the real image of the Face on Mars. Yes this first discovery or thought brought a lot of popularity and fame but now we now the truth. It took lots of time and years to come to this point scientist will keep searching for evidence but we all know this was all just a natural land form and a picture taken at a right time.",

    essay: "Although it may seem that there is a \"face\" on Mars, there isn't. There have been conspiracy theories that the \"face\" on Mars is part of the remains of an alien, but that is not true. There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.\n \n After studying the \"face\" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the \"face\" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the \"face\". There are many other theories of what the for may be.\n \n I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the \"alien head\" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the \"face\" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the \"face\" was real, but can you always trust magazines. Magazines will lie sometimes so that they get a story that people will want to read. You can't really determine that the \"face\" is actually a face.\n \n In conclusion, the \"face\" is not a face. Although it may have seemed like a face to a lot of people, it wasn't. Later on this will be a time to laugh at because some people actually thought that the rock formation was a face.",

Because through disoveries in technology we have discovered that the \"face\" on mars is not a structure made to look like a human it is simply just a mesa.\n \n The evidence in the passage supports my thesis because it states that since the original photo was taken in 1976 when they were looking for the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2 places to land they saw the \"face\" \"NASAÂ’s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" NASA have been taking pictures and researching the \"face\". Their research has helped them come to the conclusion that it is a mesa and not a martian creation to look like a human face.\n \n Also they state here that new technology has helped them take better pictures \"New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASAÂ’s Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.\". NASA shortly after discovering the \"face\" realized that it was just another martian mesa and the facial features that it had were just shadows as stated here \"the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\".\n \n As I stated in the introduction the face on Mars is simply a mesa and not a martian creation and through the data in the passage I supported my answer that there is not an actual face on Mars.",

    essay: "Twenty-five years ago a photo was taken of a natural landform that appears to look like a face. Many people will argue that it isn't a natural landform but, more of an alien artifact. While the two sides still don't see eye to eye they both have evidence that could support their belief.\n \n While, some people think that the face on Mars is \"bona-fide evidence\" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was \"important to the taxpayers\" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.\n \n So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.\n \n While NASA hasn't changed there opinion because it is in fact just a landform. Many people still want good proof that it could quite possibly be acient civilization. So, they prepared to send up another. This time they sent it up on a cloudless summer day so that no-one could argue that the weather affected the pictures. NASA was right again. This time they took up a camera that zoomed in the structure and it didn't show anything new that would have meant that there has ever been any life there.\n \n All together, these facts prove that it is just a landform. A scientist named Garvin was quoted saying \"That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" The face is indeed just like a landform that we have here on Earth. Although the other side of this long running debate did have some evidence that might have made NASA think twice, there is still more proof that it is a landform.",

    essay: "Face The Landform?\n \n Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.\n \n First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that \"face\" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.\n \n After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.\n \n Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.\n \n So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.",

    essay: "In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the \"Face on Mars\". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.\n \n When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that \"the Face\" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that \"the Face\" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.\n \n Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture \"huge rock formation...\" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of \"the Face\". The articles states the the image was \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\". This image proved that \"the Face\" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph \"on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look\". It also says \"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says \"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West\". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.\n \n The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that \"the Face\" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars. Who knows?",

    essay: "I have just read \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" and many people are convinced that the Face, found near Cydonia, is just a natural landform. However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.\n \n First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.\n \n Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,\" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.\n \n Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,\" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.\" Also, paragraph twelve states,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West.\" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.\n \n In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",

The angle that they were at made shadows that looked like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The carma they were using at the time also wasnt that great. It was good for the time but it is not as accurate compared too more recent camras.\n \n In the next few photos of the face of mars you can clearly see that it is just a rock formation and not a face. The face of mars was just a rock formatoin and some perfictley placed shadows. In the most recent picture of it you can see that it looks nothinhg like a face and just like a hill or big rock. Some people might say that NASA is just trying to hide the alain life but this is false.\n \n If NASA really found life forms on a diffrent planet they would tell every body because they would make a lot of money.

    essay: "Mesa on Mars\n \n Who or what created this \"face\" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say \"the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This \"face\" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.\n \n To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it states, \"...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos.\" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...\" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.\n \n Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this \"face\" for what it is?\n \n Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars.\" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.\n \n Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the \"face\" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and \"sunny\". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been \"obducted by aliens\". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that \"scientists don't believe there is a chance of this\" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.\n \n All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa. All of these things proove that not only was \"the Face of Mars\" just a natural forming landform. Will you know the real cause of something like \"The Face of Mars\" next time you see one?",

The picture looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. The head in the picture was enormous. We figured that the face was nearly 2 miles from end to end. Some time later after studying and researching the picture, we leaked the picture to the public so they could give us there thoughts about it because NASA always likes to here from the people.

But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.\n \n Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so.

The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars.

Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.\n \n When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.\n \n This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.\n \n The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.\n \n This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.\n \n Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.\n \n Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.\n \n Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.\n \n This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.\n \n If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.\n \n In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face.\n \n The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars.",

    essay: "In 1976, Scientists made a discovery on Cydonia,a region on the Red Planet. NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of the area, looking for sites for its sister ship, Viking 2. While it began to take pictures of the region, it spotted a human-like face. Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.\n \n It has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos. There was no alien monument, only a natural landform. Finally, they gave up.\n \n After eighteen long years of investigation, many researchers gave up on the Face. Many natural landforms disappear over time which is why scientists and researchers can no longer find it. Although, some researchers are still on the look out for the Face, hoping to find it again soon.",

Some people suggest that it was formed by alien life on Mars and some people believe that it is a natrual landform. I believe it is a natural landform because of what the scientists have found.\n \n The text states, ...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Not only was the Face formed but it was also and illusion. The text also states, \"...snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos...revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" The scientists had taken a better picture after they viewed it again proving it was a natural landform. Lastly, although not everyone was satisfied, the scientists had stated, \" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, it's hard work.\" This shows that just because the supposed \"alien markings\" were hidden by clouds or haze, doesn't mean they are alien markings. The text states, \" It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, It's hard work...\" So to prove that the \" alien markings\" was just a natural landform, scientists took a second look and captured the best photo they have and proved that is was just a butte or a mesa which were \" common landforms around the American West.\" This evidence shows that is is a natural landform that is an equivalent to America's common landforms.\n \n I believe that it is a natural landform because of what scientists have found. Scientists have taken pictures and second looks of those pictures to prove that the Face isn't \"alien markings\", but a natural landform.

    essay: "In 1976, Viking 1 took a picture of what looked to be a a human face on Mars. A few days later the picture was reviealed to the public eye, and it was starred in hollywood film movies, books, magazines, and talks shows. But in 2001, new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it was only a mesa. Though there are many credible reasons to believe that it was only a mesa, some people still believe that is an alien artifact.\n \n Yes, one might think that the mesa looks like a face from an egyptian Pharoh, but after closer examination, it was only a natural landform. We are able to prove this because on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Sureyor flew over for the first time, a picture was taken that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that showed only a natural landform. When the picture was unveiled to the public eye, it had a caption that told people it was a mesa that resembled a human face only because shadows that were on the rock gave an opticl illusion of eye,nose, and mouth. Also on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enogh for a second look and used the cameras absolute maximum resolution to take an even better picture that again showed that it was only a mesa. From these pictures alone you can tell that there wasn't a face on Mars and that there isn't any extraterrestial beings living on Mars.\n \n in conclusion, the \"face\" on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform that you can probably see on Earth. Also if there were to actually be life on Mars, it would be a major break through that would help better fund NASA, so what would be the piont in trying to hide it from the public that funds our research? There would be no piont in doing so which means that there isn't any life on Mars and the face is only a mesa or butte.",

    essay: "So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?\" the man asked. \"I'm not buying it.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" I replied, \"and I'm about to show you why I'm right.\"\n \n The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, \"I'm all ears.\"\n \n The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\".\n \n To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the \"face\" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, \"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.\n \n \"Whatever, geek!

If this figure is mad eby natural causes on the planet it has faded away over the years. Most people around the world think this figure is made by aliens, This figure could have been made by the astronauts on the ships and they just made a figure and took a picture of it and made people think that it was made by aliens. This figure could have been made not even on the planet they could have took some clay or some other material and made a rock like face and said that they found it on the planet. This figure is probably a fake because how often do you go to a planet and just find a random rock that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up. If they do take another picture it has to have the shuttle to where you can see it so the people around the world can say it is in space. If there really is a face figure on that planet that might be a sign of life on the planet. Maybe the astronauts have found another planet with life it may not be human it may be im not saying that aliens are real but if there is life on that planet this whole world will be wanting to go up there and see for themselves.

    essay: "Did aliens create an amazing masterpiece on Mars or are you just imagining that they did? Aliens surely do not exist or are for sure not on Mars. It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.\n \n First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This \"alien created object\" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?\n \n Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.\n \n Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this \"plain\" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.\n \n It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.\n \n Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this. Wondering and believing are both good things but if you don't focus on the truth of reality, you will not suceed.",

I believe the \"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform, not every person in the world may agree but if you look at the facts and evidence together you will be able to comprehend the \"Face\" is not an aliens monument, it is a natural landform.",

    essay: "Face\" the Facts\n \n The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the \"truth\" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the \"Face on Mars\" is nothing more than a natural landform.\n \n First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" it says \"...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.\n \n Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.\n \n Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.\n \n To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to\n \n In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.\n \n - E.M.",

    essay: "Mistaken Face\n \n NASA is a space program in the U.S. It has been for quite some time now. NASA has sent numerous things into space but one in specific has caused a great deal of curiosity through out the world. In 1976, a NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, took pictures of Mars and something unusual happened. A face apeared in a picture. At first NASA thought of the possibility of it being a foreign life form. But that possibility was stopped when scientists found out that it was just another Martian Mesa. A common landform on Mars. When the pictures were released to the public, many thought that NASA was lying, especially conspiracy theorists. They thought that NASA didn't want the public to know about an alien life form. That was very irrational.\n \n Many people don't like the idea of space exploration because they say it's a waste of money. If NASA encountered foreign life forms, it would only be benefitial to tell the public because then NASA would gain popolarity and skeptism of the program would decrease. Many people would be curios about it and would want to know more about the race. Therefore NASA would have a better reputation and be more popular because of their discovery.\n \n Secondly,technology has changed significantly since 1978. The original picture looks more like the face than any other one because of the old technology. In 1998, the picture looks more detailed. In 2001, it looks even more detailed. In 1976 the camera that took the photo only captured 43 meters per pixel making it much less definated compared to the picture taken in 2001 that captured 1.56 meters per pixel. This technology makes it less of a face.\n \n Finally, because of the newer and more advanced technology, NASA's scientists could look further in to the so called alien face. After studying it, the scientists concluded that the \"face\" was a mesa. A mesa isnt't only found on Mars. It can also be found on Earth. There is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it even has the same height as the Face on Mars. The \"face\" is more of a natural landform than anything.\n \n New technoogy, comparable lndforms, and the explanation of how alien races would benefit NASA helped the space program prove conspiricy theorists and the public wrong. All of these supports are hard evidence that the face was a mesa in disguise. Although the finding of an alien race would be revolutionary, it's safe to say that the \"face\" isn't the discovery of one. We'll just have to wait until the future to encounter a race that isn't our own.",

Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa biom. The face in the area of Mars know as Cydonia is a mesa biom, so natural formations accur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa biom.\n \n The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not a alien structure. As it said in the article, \"Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact.\" They are the ones that truely study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique stucture that was naturaly created.\n \n The second reason is that the first image was burry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were cearer and prooved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.\n \n The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa biom.

Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to accur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.\n \n There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa biom so this is natural.",

    essay: "As a scientist at NASA I strongly believe that the \"The Face on Mars\" is simply a martian from of a mesa, which is commonly found on Cydonia. According to the text \"There was no alien monument after all.\" This was of course after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydonia and captured a higher resolution image of \"The Face.\" In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.\n \n Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.\n \n In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon \"Mars martian face\" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere. There was no need for all the chaos and random conspiracy theories, all it need was a little bit of science and hard work.",

Exactly, so therefor this Unmasking the face on Mars, is antural. I mean jsut look at the way it is imprinted into Mars, there is physically no way an alien could do this. I think that believing that an alien could possibly do this, is just crazy.\n \n The evidence i have are these pictures, i mean look at them. Also just listen to others opinons, some agree that aliens are no where near smart enough to do something like this. I think it is a nautral fromation because this is a scientific object here, it is a planet. So there for why would it not be? Many things happen on a daily basis. Also things age, possibly it is jsut aging and slowly starting to decae. This \" face on Mars \" thing is honestly just weird. I believe that maybe something somewhere happened in the past and thar is how the face got there so basically naturally, i just do not agree that aliens could have done naything close to this.\n \n \" Unmasking the afce on Mars\", that is an opionated statement. It could be true, but it could be not true also. These pictures show not one bit of proof of laiens, so how could aliens do this? They could not have. These little air soace craft things go around and aorund and around for seconds, mintues, hours, days, years, so there is phsyically not a way for these aliens to become invisable and create a face on Mars.",

The Face on Mars is just a landform because it looks similar to landforms on Earth, only at certain angles does it look like a face, and high quality pictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform.\n \n The Face on Mars is similar to landforms here on Earth.

The author of the article states, \"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face\" (8). High quality ppictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform. In paragraph 11, The scientist says, \"...you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were\" (11).\n \n The reasons that the Face on Mars is just another landform are that it looks like landforms on Earth, only certain angles show the Face, and high quality photos of the Face prove that fact. conspiracy theories are wrong because they don't have any facts to back up that this could be created by aliens. This is why the Face on Mars is not created by aliens, but by natural forces on the red planet.",

    essay: "Was there a man on Mars? Magazines say yes, but the scientists have continuously said no. On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.\n \n First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the \"facial features\" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.\n \n Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.\n \n Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the \"face\". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.\n \n In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point. Scientists proved their point by explaining unusual shadows, confirming information with additional scientists, and taking countless photographs of the mesa.",

The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, \"the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze.\" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.\n \n Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, \"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.\n \n Based on research, and facts from, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars\"\n \n On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.\n \n Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.\n \n The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA\"s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.\n \n In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",

Also, the passage says that on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and the team snapped a picture, revealing that it was just a landform. Even though the team did this, people still beleive that it was a face. The Face of Marshad become a very big thing for pop culture. It was on TV, was in books, and on the radio.\n \n We see things in everyday life like clouds. They remind us of animals, objects, maybe even memories. I cannot make a conclusion and say that cloud is a bunny and think that one day a bunny was in the cloud and it's face started to form. It is based on your perspective. To me, it looks like a natural landform on Mars but maybe to other people it looks like some type of ancient face. If people think it is an ancient face then people are going to ask questions then it creates an even bigger mystery. This was just coencidence. So, that is why I think that the creation on Mars is just a natural landform.",

    essay: "The face on mars is a natural landform, I know this because in the most recent picture there are many cracks in the formation. More reasons I know this is because aliens do not exist. The last reason of how I know Mars is not made by any type of alien is how would they know what humans look like. Most of NASA's people believe that it wasnt made, but is a natural landform. NASA was confident that it was a formation as well after posting it on their website they captioned \" A huge rock formation\" this shows that the majority of NASA believe this as well. I know no aliens know what we look like because we never seen any aliens orbiting or trying to take a photo. The way that I know aliens dont exist is because there are none that we've seen after years and years of study. In conclusion, I know that this wasnt made by any living thing and that it is a natural landform because aliens dont exist, they dont know what we look like, and NASA, who works on things like these every single day think it is a natural landform.",

People always talk about martians, but never really find them.\n \n Mars has peculiar weather conditions. They have dust storms. They dust gets whipped by wind. Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.\n \n Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars. Usually the crafts land on 3 or more legs. The craft could have possibly marked a dust mound. Wind three or more legs, you could form the face on Mars' surface.\n \n What NASA needs to do is send more crafts and robots. I think they should do that to get mor eevidence then just taking some pictures. THe robots can do things that a human would. The robot can feel the face and dig to see what is under it. Yes, it would ruin the face but we would get evidence and details if we try.\n \n In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform.

    essay: "The face is just a natural landform and not evidence of an alien attack. There are many reasons why this landform is only natural and not any type of alien proof. One of those is that if NASA found a secret alien civiilization they would tell us because it would help increase their budget. Another reason that it's just a natural landform is because it is just like some other natural landforms on Earth and other mesa's on Mars. The last reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that NASA is scietifically trained and would know if it was proof of alien's existence but the conspiracy theorists aren't scientifically trained and would be less likely to know exactly what it is.\n \n The first reason that it's just a natural landform is that NASA would tell us if it was proof of an alien attack. It states in the text that \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" which shows how it would help increase their budget. Since the Face is so popular and has even become a pop icon if NASA were to find out it was proof of an alien attack they would most likely tell us because since it is so popular it would give them a significant increase to their budget. That is just one of the three reasons that I will b talking about in this essay.\n \n The second reason that the Face is just a natural landform is because it is just like other landforms on Earth and around that area on mars. In the article it says \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West\". That passage from the article shows that there are landforms on Earth that look similar to that one on Mars so it couldn't be proof of an alien attack. The article also says \"scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh\". That shows that other landforms that resemble the Face on that part of Mars isn't uncommon. The only thing that made the Face stand out from other landforms was the shadows which made it appear to have a face that looked like an egyptian pharoah.\n \n The third and final reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that the scientists would know better than any of the conspiracy theorists would so we should believe them. NASA has no reason to hide the Face from us because even if it was an alien attack, as I stated in paragraph two, it would help increase their budget. Other conspiracy theorists believe NASA is just trying to hide the proof of an alien attack but if that was what they were doing, they wouldn't have released a picture of the Face at all. Also when NASA realeased a new high resolution image in 2001 and a 3D altimetry of the Face, the landform no longer reseambled a face, which is proof that it is just a mesa.\n \n Those 3 reasons are the reasons you should believe scientists and not think it is an alien landform. NASA has nothing to hide since it would increase their budget. They also are more trained in knowing what landforms on mars are than any conpiracy theorists are. The other reason is because there are many other landforms on Earth that resemble faces which could be compared to the Face. Those 3 reasons are why we should all stop trying to make conspiracy theories and just believe what NASA is trying to tell us, that it's just a mesa.",

    essay: "Long ago, Vikings spotted a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. It was about two miles long and was located on a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some people are convinced that aliens on the Red Planet, but others would beg to differ. Most scientists agree that aliens are just a myth and they did not build the \"face. Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he \"face.\"\n \n For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the \"face\" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this \"face\" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face.\" Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.\n \n Still not satisfied with my argument? If not, listen to this. With all of the new technology these days, there is even more proof as to why there was no aliens who built the \"face.\" A camera took photos of the \"face\" with maximum resolution. With the high technology cameras, scientists could look at the photo three times as large as the origianl snapshot. Becasue the scientists can zoom in so much, they would have been able to see if there were any aliens on the planet. The picture actually shows Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, which are llandforms commonly located around American West.\n \n Most scientists would agree that there never was alien life on Cydonia. Thanks to technology, this point can be proven even further. Obviously, aliens did not build the \"face\" that is on the Red Planet.",

    essay: "Do you believe in aliens? In 1976 the Viking 1 spacecraft of NASA discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face! Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.\n \n The first reason why this \"face\" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.\n \n Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\n \n However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.\n \n So in conclusion the \"face\" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.",

I am going to tell you those three reasons.\n \n The first reason is that all this time from when they first took the picture to the last time they took the picture it has never been touched or even looked like it was messed by anyone. Proving that the so called \"human face made by aliens\" was not only unrealistic but also doubting Nasa, who has been in work since the first time the United states landed on the moon. Reason two, why would you be doubting a group when they have been working on new technoligy for modern space traveling for a long time. Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the \"human Face\". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do. Nasa even had qualified scientists to make sure it was't an alien face and even confirmed it. The third reason is because on April 5, 1998 when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped pictures ten times sharper and confirmed it was just a natural landform. Once again in April 8, 2001 Nasa proved that it was not a an alien sculpture once again. Garvins said \" it reminded him the most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Once again proving that it was not a alien made sculpture.\n \n People still might believe that it was an alien made sculpture. But multiple times it has been checked and everytime it was checked with a better camera. Multiple Nasa teams went through checking this out and still proved it to be a landform.",

    essay: "Twenty five years ago a sacecraft valled Viking 1 from NASA took a picture of what looked like a human face. Eighteen years later Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of it that was ten times larger than the last one. This photograph showed that it was nothing more than a natural land form. Some people thought that it looked this way because of clouds. Finaly in 2001 Mars Global Surveyor took a second shot at it with a much better resalution. This one also suggests that it is nothing more than a landform. Some people still think this was made by aliens despite all of the evidence going against it. I think that it is just a landform because, aliens wouldn't know what humans looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other things it could be.\n \n My first reason is that aliens would not know what humans look like. If you think about it animals on earth don't look like humans so aliens wouldn't look like that either. Mars also has really bad conditions for life like us to survive. Plus aliens woul probably look even more different than animals because they evolved on a whole other planet. It is even more unlikely that they would just guess what we look like.\n \n Another reason is that it isn't that crazy of a coincidence. A human face is only two dots with a dot centeered under neath them and a line under it. and this doesn't even have a very distinctive nose so its just two dots and a line. Its like when you look at the clouds and see what looks like animals or other familiar things. You know aliens didn't put those there.\n \n My last reason is that there are plenty of other things this could be. It could just be some sort of landform. Espescially in the last picture you can see lines it it resembling something that was made naturally. It is kind of like a butte or messa on earth only this is on mars. This is most likely made naturally.\n \n The chances that this was made by aliens is incredibly low. The first picture however, does closely resemble a human's face. The problem is that with each picture it looks les and less like a human face. Also the last picture was taken on a cloudless summer day. I dont think this was built by aliens because, aliens wouldn't know what we looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other explanations.",

    essay: "The disputes about the Face being an alien creation rather than a landform are preposterous. Alien life is a common conspirasy theory, but this one proves just that: a theory. The Face cannot possibly be an alien creation because there is no evidence of alien life ever existing, the landform it is compared to on Earth was certainly not created by aliens, and scientists have extensively studied it to prove that it is, indeed, a natural landform.\n \n For starters, in order for the aliens to create this two-mile long \"face\", dimensioned straight from NASA, they must first exist. Unfortunately for the pro-alien believers, this has never been proven. Some say that NASA is keeping this monumental secret from us, but, as thoughtfully pointed out in the article, the existance of ancient alien life would benefit them immensely. In this case, there is no reason for them to hide anything.\n \n Another thing worth mentioning is the strong resemblance to the landforms found right here in the United States. These mesas are common in the American West, says chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. There is no reason that they can't be common on the Red Planet, either. The article states that in Cydonia, the region where the Face is located is actually known to have mesas scattered frequently around the area. Unless Earth's mesas, too, were crafted by aliens, they both must be natural landforms.\n \n The Face has been a topic of conversation since it was first photographed in 1976. When NASA first released the picture to the public, the caption stated: \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Then, after extensive research to prove that it was actually not an alien creation of sorts, NASA determined that the shadows were, indeed, the cause of the shapes of the Face. It was even photographed numerous times to prove this fact, and because they felt it was important to taxpayers, as the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program noted.\n \n Skeptics of the Face might say that it is all a well thought out trick to hide alien life ffrom the general public. However, as previously mentioned, NASA would benefit if this ancient civilization was real. Therefore, there is no logical reason they would keep this from us. The article states that when the very first picture of the Face was released: \"the authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.\" This shows us that they are wanting people to be interested, which would be much easier if there was an alien or two to report, but there is clearly not.\n \n The landform labeled the Face is certainly an intriguing discovery, but not for the fact it was an acient alien monument. It is interesting because it connects us with the Red Planet considering we have landforms similar to it, and also the expert study that has gone into it to prove the suspicions incorrect.",

    essay: "In the mid 70s, NASA discovered a massive face on the planet Mars, they photographed it. It resembled eyes,a nose and a mouth. NASA leaked the photo, then people, including scientist and astronomers,started to wonder if it were created by aliens!\n \n I disagree,I do not think the face was created by aliens, and there are various reasaons. I do not think the face was created by aliens and I am going to explain why,a face can`t be created by aliens unless it were remains,scientist would have already discovered aliens before the face if it were to be created by aliens, and NASA revealed the face as 2 miles long,it couldn`t be created by aliens.\n \n The face on Mars couldn`t have been created by aliens,how can a face be created by aliens, unless it were alien remains? If it were alien remains,that means aliens would have to exist. Scientist have not found aliens or alien remains to this day. A sharper picture of the face proved it wasn`t created by aliens, mentioned in paragraph 7. Besides, aliens can`t create a face.\n \n If it were to be created by aliens we would have discovered aliens before we found this huge face. Space rovers have been searching the planet mars before the face was found. The face is two miles long according to paragraph one,it would take some time to build it. We would have found aliens building it before we found the face itself. Thus, the face is a natural landform.\n \n The face is two miles long, if it were aliens existing, they would not be able to build something like this. An alien wouldn`t create a two mile landform if it exsited. It would not be a reason to, there would be no benificiary reason for an alien to build a face. It was also discovered as a natural landform. It couldn`t possibly be created by aliens.\n \n In conclusion, I do not think the two mile landform was created by aliens. The only way it would be alien related is if it were alien remains. If it were created by aliens, we would have discovered them already. Since the landform is two miles long,it would take some time if it were to be build. Besides,it`s two miles long, there is no benificiary reason for an alien to spend this much time on a landform, it couldn`t possibly be created by aliens. This is why I dont believe that the face on Mars, was created by aliens.",

    essay: "Imagine going to outer space, and you land on Mars. When you get there you find a landform that you haven't seen before. This could be something big, but you know it isn't alive, so you have to assume it is a landform. When you go back and show everyone what you found people think it is an alien, but further investigations show it is a natural landform. This Face is a natural landform because no one has ever seen something like this before, no one has any proof that it is a human or alien, and NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor say it is a landform.\n \n First of all, no one has seen anything like this before. The text states,\" There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors.\" This peice of evidence shows that the face is new to them, and they don't know what it is. Another piece of evidence is,\" Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars.\" This, also, shows that NASA doesn't know what it is. If no one knows what it is then you can't say it is a human or alien without knowing the facts.\n \n Secondly, no one has any proof that it could be an alien or a human. For instance, the text states,\" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.\" This piece of evidence shows that they can't figure out exactly what the face is. They are making aussumtions of what the face might be, but they aren't one-hundred percent sure of what it is. NASA would have to have proof to say it is an alien or not.\n \n Lastly, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet he found out the face was a natural landform. For example, the text states,\" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.\" This shows that once they got a clear picture of the face, the JPL found out it was just an ordinary landform. The text also states,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" This piece of evidence found in the text shows that NASA figured out that the face was a landform. Yes, the face did look like a human, but the NASA found out it was a landform when they closely examined the it.\n \n In conclusion, the face that was thought to be an alien or a human was clearly a natural landform. First of all, it was never seen before, so no one could be sure of what it was. Secondly, people just assumed it was an alien or a human, and they had no proof that it was. Lastly, the Mars Global Surveyor found out the face was a natural landform. This evidence shows that face everyone thought was an alien was actually a natural landform.",

    essay: "Was the Face on Mars created by aliens?\n \n Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens? I don't... and that's because it's to many reasons that prove it's not. I'm a scientist at NASA and I helped prove these reasons. We found that it is just a butte or a mesa, aliens are not even real, and there is no life on Mars.\n \n It has been proven that it is just a butte or a mesa, this is what the picture actually shows....landforms. A friend my mine, Garvin says that is reminds him of \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" that's here on Earth. So that states that we have the resources to prove it is a mesa!\n \n It has been proven aliens are not even real. I mean people \"say\" they have seen one and even took pictures of them, but that doesn't mean they are real. We have not yet seen or even captured one for testing yet which proves that they are not real. This person who tells me that they \"think\" aliens created this face doen't even know if it's true. Therefore this is just a thought that is not true.\n \n On another note there is no life on Mars, as proven by us (NASA). We have tested for air and a way we could live there without holding a oxegen tank around and there is no way. People think we are hiding if there is any life on Mars and if the face was created by aliens, but why would we let the World know that we were even researching about life on Mars or that we even found a face on Mars if we didn't want the World to know? Yes, we've done research over and over again to prove to the World that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a mesa, so we ask that the World believes us and keep the peace.\n \n I have given my reasons why aliens did not create this face on Mars, and you may or may not agree, just please I ask you to keep the peace.",

    essay: "The Face''\n \n As we all know in the year of 1976 Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo which was belived to be a \"face'' formed in Mar's surface. There has also been arguments over the years if \"the face\" was created by aliens or was it just a natural landform. Here is why I belive it is a natural landform.\n \n In the article \"Umasking the Face on Mars, in paragraph 12 it says what the picture that the picture actually shows that the Martian is equaivalent to a butte or messa which are landforms common around the American West. Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion. Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,\" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.\n \n Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.\n \n In conclusion, I belive that \"The Face\" was a just a natural landform. I belive this because of the eveidence that NASA provided and the fact that they went back to space and took anthor picture with up to date technology.",

    essay: "Is there a face is on Mars? I would say no, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact. There are shadows that can make it seem like a face ,but shadows can alter thing appearnces. April 5th, 1998, and April 8th 2001 have clearer images that can prove that prove that it is also not alien. Unlike the photos of the Viking 1 in 1976 ,which were older and were less clear. So the Face is not real because of, the later more clearer images prove that it is not, and shadows can alter one's apperance.\n \n First off, the Face on the isn't a face it is a rock on Mars, that had shaows that made it look like face. People and imgaes can come about blurry ,and may looklike something else. Also pixels also can help make things seem like they are not what the they are. Like the picture in April 8th, 2001 pixels made it look clearer. A compasrion can be shared of the 1976 picture to the 2001 picture, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\"(10). There is comparaion toeach photo that was taken and as time went on it got clearer and showed less of a face. Which makes it more of reason it is not an ailean artifact.\n \n Next, on April 5th ,1998 after the 1976 Viking picture of the face on Mars became a hit. NASA wanted to go take another picture ,because people keppsying it was made by aliens,it was difficult though. After NASA had gotten the photo though,it was more clear, which again proves that it is not an alien artifact. Even in the passage it states about it ,\"Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tne times sharper than the origianl Viking photos\"(7). After that it was on the web people realized that it is a land form not a alien structure. So it is a fact that it is not an alien artifact.\n \n Finally, On april 8th ,2001, people still were blieving that alien made the landform. So NASA snapped another picture, in the passage it states \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view\"(10). This mean they had gotten a good angle on the Face. And the picture was more clearer again. They had proven to the world that the Face was not alien. It was a landform.\n \n My oppionent might state to me though that we did not see the real deal on screen just with a picture. They could of had edited it to make not alien. That is true but in 2001 they didn't have good editing system unlike we do today. So that image can not be really edited.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is not alien the images of April 8th, 2001 and April 5th, 1998 can prove this. Also there are not editing system theat were really good to photo shop back then, and it had been proven many times by NASA that it is not.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars\n \n Have you ever thought of being a scientist at NASA or have you ever seen the Face on Mars? Well I am a scientist and I have been very lucky to go to space and see the Face in person. It was one of the best experiences that has ever happened to me in life! Some people think that the Face was created by aliens even though there has been many tests and agreements that it is just a natural landform. I belive that it is a natural landform beacuse there is proof that scientists have figured it was just another Martian mesa, there are pictures that proves it could just be formed like that because it is common around Cydonia, and there has not yet been any proof to encourage it was created by aliens.\n \n The scientists and I have done several researches ever since we first saw the Face. Everything has yet led to prooving it is just another Martian mesa. Looking through all the pictures, everything stated that it is just a huge rock formation. The rock resembles a human head with eyes, a mouth, and a nose. I believe that after all the temperatures such as the heat and coldness, it could have caused it to be shaped like that. There has probably even been spaceships that has landed in Mars in search of investigation. The spaceships could have formed these shapes when landing there.\n \n As you probably know, it is very common around Cydonia to have these kind of natural landfoms. Yes, it is common to have shapes and forms that are unusual such as the Face. The only difference in this one was that it had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Theres not really much of a difference if you think about it. It is unbelievable that it's the first time poeple think of an alien doing this art work when they have never thought of this idea when we have found other evidence of natural lanforms like the Face.\n \n There has been plenty of evidence to proove that the Face is just a natural landform, but there is no proove of it to be created by aliens. Looking at the pictures closely, there are no footprints, fingerprints, or marks to show any living life in Mars. If theres no living life in Mars, then how could there be aliens? I want you to think about that. There has not been any kind of creatures found in Mars which is shocking.\n \n Now that I have explained myself of why I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, what do you think? Do you still believe aliens created it? If you do, I encourage you to do some research and tell me the reasons of why you think that the Face was created by aliens.

    essay: "I am here to discuss with you the topic of the landform on Mars. Yes, it's the one shaped like a human face. I have been getting many claims of it being a monument built by ancient life on Mars. Believe us, here at NASA we would love for the claims of alien life to be true, but we've been given substantial information that those claims are incorrect. There are many reasons why these claims are invalid. First of all, landforms like the so-called face appear on our home planet it would be easy to find; secondly the appearance of a face was given merely by the casting of shadows over the surface over the red plant; and lastly, the intensely zoomed in picture showed no sign of anything that would hint at any type of civilization.\n \n Here on Earth, we have tons of natural landforms created by erosion, glaciers, and the sea. The landform on Mars appears to be a mesa, a landform that happens to be very common in the western area of America. The climate of Mars can be quite similar to that of the West, and that hints to us that because of the hot climate that usually occurs with the sun shining on Mars, this landmark has formed only because of the climate and conditions of the area. It is a reasonable idea to consider and should be proof enough, but there are still some sceptics so I will continue.\n \n Some may say, even if it was a natural landform, how on Earth does it look exactly like a human face? Well first of all, people see what they wish to see. They think it's a face because it is such a fascinating and fantastic thing to think of. \"A human face on Mars?! No way!\" The landform isn't actually shaped like a face, it is merely the shadows that are cast on it that cause the appearance of it being a face. However, upon closer inspection by NASA the landform was revealed merely to be a completely normal patch of land, nothing special at all.\n \n If all of what I'm saying isn't enough to convince you, I have got one more important point to make. NASA has gone to extensive lengths to examine this landform that has caused such a big fuss among the people. In the April of 2008, scientists set out to explore the face of Mars once more. It was an apparently cloudless day and it was that day that they took the picture. The picture was zoomed in as far as it could have been, so that anything on the face of the planet could be seen. There weren't any signs of life, no tents where extra-terrestrial life would sleep and no proof of anything building this landform.\n \n To sum all of this up, there is simply just no way that this landform could have been built by alien life. There are too many facts and too much research done on this landform, we know all there is to know and what we can say for sure is, there is simply no way the Face was createed by Aliens. You'll just have to face the facts and wonder how on earth this picture managed to look exactly like a human face. The mystery was fun while it lasted, but now that we have the facts, it is time to lay this case to rest.",

Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.\n \n Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence.",

    essay: "Gerald was one of the scientists that led the investigation on the Face. He had been to college already, so he has been very experienced with these types of scenarios. He used NASA's Viking 1, and saw an object that appeared to be a face. He got a closer look later in his career, and it was not an actual face. This was later taken by surprise by the general public, and they still thought that it had to be a real sign of life on Mars. Because of this research, I believe that the face is just a natural landform. Three reasons why I believe this is true are that NASA's research has proven this, photographs taken by NASA have shown that this is true, and comparisons to landforms on Earth have shown the public that this is the truth.\n \n My first reason for stating my opinion would be that NASA's research has proven that the Face is a landform. An example of this from the text would be that NASA has published many photos of the Face to show the public that it was just a landform. To further explain this, if you look close enough at the pictures in this passage, then you can see it is a landform. It may look like a face from a far distance, but evidence given by NASA has shown that this is not the case.\n \n My second reason for this is the fact that NASA has taken many photographs of this landform to prove it is true. Here is a quote from the text that shows this: \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" Later in this paragraph, it states that the picture has proven that there was not an alien monument. Secondly, as people stated, it was a cloudy day in Mars, so they were not satisfied with the picture. So, \"On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Later in the paragraph, Garvin, an expert that works with NASA, says this: \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Even though it wasn't cloudy, the team of NASA got the same result: it is just a landform.\n \n My last reason would be that comparisons to landforms on Earth have proven that this is true. Garvin says in paragraph twelve that \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" What this is saying is that there have been similar landforms on Earth that are on Mars. Scientists can use this data to compare different pieces of landforms on different planets. Using this, they can figure out what the Face actually is, and other mysteries that they come up against.\n \n Some people may have used to say that the picture was too blurry to make out what the Face actually was. However, NASA has taken many clear photos of the Face, and they have proven several times that it is not an alien artifact, and that it is only a landform on the surface of the planet.\n \n So, what do you think now? Do you still believe that the Face is an ancient artifact? Well, you should not anymore after reading this; the evidence given here in this essay clearly shows that the Face is just a landform. Scientists like Gerald and Garvin have shown this a repeated amount of times. So, in conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, and not proof of life on Mars.",

It's proven by Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbit Camera because it's ten time sharper than the orginal.

    essay: "Just another day working at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Day's at the Lab went by as any other day for the scientist's, not finding anything new up in space, just a few minor event's here and there, but nothing big. I went in my office, and was informed today we were going to try and find any possible landing site's for Viking 1's sister ship, Viking 2. As usual we went to work. Orbiting Mars for what seemed like an eternity! I'm literally bored out of my mind, until out of the corner of my eye I see something, not just a star or anything, but to my eyes looked like a human face staring right back at us through Viking 1.\n \n Confusion is all us scientist's felt when we saw that face on Mars, just plain fear and confusion. Nothing was spoken much about it among us scientist's since we were all super shocked and speechless, that was until we were on our lunch break. All I heard was \"Alien's\", really alien's can they possibly pin this \"face\" on Aliens! The table next to me also seemed to think alien's made this Egyptian-type face. I dont know what came over me something just clicked and I said \"How can you possibly pin this on alien's?!\" of course this started a one-on-one argument with me and another scientist \"What do you mean, how can it not be Alien's\" he answered. \"First of all, it was spotted near Cydonia, a part of Mars where Martian Mesa's are commonly being found everyday, so how do we not know it isn't just another Mesa?\" \"If you think this is a mesa, how would it take form to look like a human being's face? Dont you think that is too much of a coincidence to happen?!\" at that I left it alone, maybe it was too much of a coincidence, but that wasn't going to affect my thought on the \"Mesa\"\n \n The word on the \"Face\" spreaded around the world, becoming a hot topic for people everywhere, most of them thinking it was made by Alien's. I didnt really get much into it until that scientist kid came up to me again, \"Still think it wasn't made by alien's?!\" \"Of course, why wouldn't I?\" \"How can you not think it was alien's! The picture became known to the world and everyone think's it was alien's, which they are probably right!!\" \"How can we know for sure this was created by alien's!? Think about it we dont have great technology yet, that \"Mesa\" was in the form of a face because our photo was too blurry and it was really cloudy!!\" I really didnt want to end up on the wrong foot with this guy so i just walked away.\n \n April 5,1998- I walk into the office and apparently we are going to take a look at Cydonia for the \"Face\" again. This was actually a releif to me, because I know that now our technology is way more advanced and we could see with a sharper picture what this thing really is, a mesa. So it happened Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took a picture ten time's sharper than the old one! As to my conclusion, the egyptian face ended up to be a mesa! This mesa took form of a face because of the shadow's that went over the mesa. As I heard of this new's I couldn't help but look back at that one scientist, and whipering \"Look who the right one is now!\" with the most accomplishing smirk on my face that I can make. ;]",

We weere sitting in my living room on the tan couch with the television on. My friend was tall with blonde hair and skinny. I had brown hair and was average height. I worked for Nasa so I had seen pictures of what it was and had proof that it was only a mesa and it was an illusion to the human eye.\n \n Zeke thought it was an artifact on once living life on Mars. He thought Nasa was going to say it was something else so people wouldn't truly know what it was. He thought Nasa was trying to keep it in the dark so noone would try and travel there to get closer looks on it and steal there idea. Zeke thought we needed to run further studies to truely figure out what this was.\n \n I told Zeke that it was only a landform on Mars and not some alien artifact. I told him that it was a mesa which was common in this area of Mars. I also explained how shadows made it look like a face and how it was all an illusion that was visible to the human eye. They said that this landform was nothing more than a landorm on Mars that wasnt what it had appered to be.\n \n Zeke, who was a man of what he said, did not believe me and wouldn't take my word for it.

    essay: "Its Just A Landform\n \n NASA recently has just seen a human looking face on Mars, NASA has an image of the \"Face\" and they have released it for public view. People have questioned \"Was it created by aliens?\" So many people believe that it was indeed created by aliens. I believe that it is just a natural landform and it just so happened to look like a human face, for these many reasons.\n \n In the article \"Unmasking Face on Mars\" it states that many people believe that this is not just a landform, it is some kind of alien creation. But, i can tell you otherwise. In stanza 3 it says, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It clearly says,\"formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" That can give you an image of how the shadows could have formed this face like creation.\n \n Another reason for this not being an alien cretaion as it states in stanza 7 of this article,\"thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"This is a great reason for people to realize that it is not an alien creation. After a team captured another photo but ten times sharper, than the original Viking photos, they finally saw that it was nothing more than a natural landform and it must've been shadows that created such human like looks, as I already stated and also as stated in the article.\n \n Although, people will still think it was an alien creation and NASA is keeping it away from the public, we are highly not. There has been no sight of any alien activity what so ever. The \"Face\" is not a start of alien activity and probably never will be.\n \n In conlusion, this so called \"alien creation\" is not an alien creation. I know and believe it is not an alien creation, due to those reasons that I have named above. This human face looking creation is only and nothing more a natural landform.",

    essay: "In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The \"Head\" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.\n \n The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was \"Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth.\" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.\n \n This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.\n \n Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.\n \n While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.\n \n Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.\n \n They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.\"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were\" Said Jim Garvin.\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. \"It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" Says Garvin. \"Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars.\" He added. So weather or not theFace is an alien landform or a rock formation, NASA does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupiclatiy to the Red Planet. However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive.",

NASA claim's for it to look or be visualized as a viking. These face's do look like natural landforf's.\n \n They look like wind or a storm formed them. In face one it look's like there is alot of wind when NASA took the picture. In face two it kinda revels a little more .

Can that mean there natural.\n \n Think about this if these structure's were man made or alein made they wouldn't look like this so what is that telling us.

Also to my understanding NASA has been watching the faces for a while.\n \n Then in picture three it is just totaly blown over. It seem's as if wind just keept blowing over then time and time agian.

The idea that this is a real alien landform has been proven wrong and wrong again, so why do people still gravitate toward it?\n \n The poor quality cameras back in 1976 are nothing compared to the ones in 2001. There are photos of the landform from 2001 that make it look nothing like a face. The most recent photos have been taken on a cloud less day, with the resolution up as far as it would go. This means that the photo was as sharp as it possibly could be. If there were any small structers next to the landform, you could also see those.\n \n There is a preconcieved notion that NASA is hiding the discovery that the face is alien made. Why would NASA want to hide it though? If there was alien life on Mars, NASA could gain a lot of money from the publicity. Think about it, NASA could gain so much from proving that that land form is ,in fact, alien made.\n \n In conclusion,the fact that the famous face on mars is an alien made landform, has been almost completely busted.

Not everyone was satisfide with the announcement. They still believe of ancient civilazation on Mars.

    essay: "Do you belive in aliens?\n \n The first reason why i say that the face was just natural landforms is because,there is no such things as aliens! For example the text says\" a shadowy likeness of a human face.\" This example show that likeness isn't always certain you have to be absolutley sure before you start making claims about what the picture is showing. Did you see it for yourself? Did you do any research about it?\n \n Another reason why the alien story is real is because ,no one officially approved it. They only took pictures of the face.\n \n No one went down on mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says\" only this one had unusual shadws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh\". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it?\n \n The next reason why the alien myth isnt true is because in the passage it says the word\"illusion\" the word illusion means something that you can see but is not there. For example in the tex it states that \" formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth\". This example shows that an illusion may seem real but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable.\n \n Finally, why people say that the landfrom was formed by aliens is because it\n \n \" appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows--- even haunted grocery store for 25 years\". They don't know just because this thing goes publice dosen't mean it is true. For example\" Some people thimk that it is bona fide evidence\". The people that think taht it is bona fide evidence did they do any research or did they just rely on what the social media says. In conclusion you should believe that the face is a natural landform is because aliens isn't real.",

    essay: "The face on mars is a natural occuring phenomon that occurs over time. It may look that it is created by some kind of super natural being. Jim Gavins cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program said \" It remindes me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as teh face on Mars,\". That means that the \" Face on mars\" is a natural occuring phenomon caused by lava.\n \n Althought not everybody beleives that the face is a natural occuring phenomon they believe that is evidence of a ancient Martian civilization. This therory is highly impossible that it is evidence of a ancient Martian civilization. But there are still people that believe it is a ancient Matian civilization, but most of the people on Eart believe and know that is a natural occuring phonomon that is caused by something natural to that planet possbly lava or maybe pressure.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. There is no proof whatsoever of any signs of life on Mars, which means no aliens. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that coincidently looks like a human face. Given the shadows and shape, the Face very much looks like it has a human nose mouth, and eyes. Although up close, there is no resemblence of a human face. Therefore, do not let this anyone fool you.\n \n Pictures have been taken by NASA of the Face to prove it is just a natural landform. Pictures taken from 1976 appear blurry, and not clear, so it is easy to believe that aliens created the Face. Although, in 1998, the pictures taken aren't as blurry, and you can see the structure of the landfrom clearly. Lastly, the picture taken in 2001 is clear and visible. You can perfectly see that close up, the Face is just another natural landform on Mars. From far away, it looks like a human face because of the shadows, but up close, it is nothing more than a simple landform.\n \n Furthermore, on 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to looks for the Face again. When they snapped a photo of it, it was indeed \"ten times sharper than the photo taken in 1976.\" This revealed that it was just a natural landform when the photo appeared online. \"There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n Some people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that \"alien markings were hidden by haze\", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken. Since it was winter in April 1998, it was also the \"cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" Therefore, the camera used had to \"peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.\" This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it's the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face.\n \n Plus, when NASA took another picture in 2001, it was taken using the \"camera's absolute maximum solution.\" Based on what I read, \"each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" There simply can't be anything you can miss using the camera's absolute maximum solution. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, even said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could what they where!\"\n \n Finally, NASA's explanation about the Face on Mars is based on credible information and research. People who believe aliens created the Face often get the information inside their head, making up crazy theories that aren't actually true. Furthermore, NASA went on missions to prove that the Face isn't made by aliens. They took high-quality photos that show that it is just a natural landscape. Besides making things up on their own, skeptics probably take information from the internet on websites that other skeptics have made about aliens creating the Face. You can never trust the internet, and the skeptics who made these websites probably put down their own made up facts and theories to get people to join their side.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just extraordinarily shaped to look like a human head, with shadows to create the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth from far away. Up close, there is not resemblence of a human face at all. Pictures, missions, and years of research have proved it. Plus, there were no signs of aliens, or any life on Mars when they conducted this research. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.",

NASA on 1976 took a photo of Mars, nothing odd right except this odd looking thing that looked like a face. Many scientist thought it was just a land mass that happen to look like a face but the people around the world though of it as an aliens doing.\n \n This idea is wrong in many levels for instant years later they took another photo and it shows that is was nothing but a butte or mesa, but this still did not stop people thinking other wise. What more do they want, we showed them prove and photos that it was just a normal land mass nothing more. The people weren't statisfied though they thought it was just a cover up, yet NASA would be better off if there was , so why would they hide it if they would be better with it.\n \n The idea that the face on Mars was aliens is nothing but nonsense. We really should be doing other things than trying to prove this as true. Does this say that their is not any other beings in the universe no, but this is just a normal land mass found on Mars nothing more nothing less, Or MABEY this is what they want us to think, nahh.",

The face on Mars might look like it was created by aliens, but our reasearch shows that it is just shadows. Also because we have been doing reaserch for so long all of our studies show that there is no possible way that any creature would be able to survive on any other planet in our solar system other then Earth. Also as it said in our reserch it is just a rock formation that happened because of soemthing like a landslide.\n \n When all of us here at Nasa first saw the image we knew we had to study it! When we beagan our studies we sent a space craft up to take pictures. When we recived those pictures we noticed that it looked like it was a shadow of the way we were taking the picture or maybe the way that rocks were laying. We were all still curious on how the rocks got there so we kept studying!\n \n At NASA there is always reaserch of something going on! When we first started reaserch one of our main goals was to figure out if there is any possible way that people could live on any other planet then Earth. So far we have concluded that there is no possible way that anyone could survive on any other planent, because there is no suply of food or water. So with our prior knoladge of that we knew that there were no aliens on any planets!\n \n Even though we knew all these things we still wanted to know more so we continued our reasearch. While contuning our reaserch we found out that it was highliy possible that there was something like a landslide on Mars. With our knoladge of landslides we knew that they can sometimes form things like rock scopluters that look like things they are something they are not. So with all of our reaserch we all came to a conclusion.\n \n All of us at NASA were very sure with our conclusion of this was not created by aliens that it was just something as simple as a land slide and shadows. Throughout our reasearch we found out that the reason the rocks look like a face is shadows, and that the rocks got there from something like a landslide. These are the reasons us at NASA belive that the face on Mars was not created by aliens but simply rocks and a shadow.",

    essay: "The Â¨Face\" on Mars is a mere coincidence. There are many formations like this one on earth. When using the Mars Global Survey spacecraft itÂ´s high resolution camera picked up no signs of any type of advanced civilization. Authors of magazines at the time also hyped the Â¨FaceÂ¨ up, to get more people interested in Mars. This story has been used in an array of entertainment, from movies to magazines.\n \n On Earth there are formations called buttes, Â¨ ThatÂ´s a lava domes that take formation of an isolated mesa...Â¨ according to paragraph twelve. Also in paragraph twelve it states that on Earth these landforms are most common in the American west. These particular formations are especially common in the Cydonia region of Mars. Finding these landforms in this region are so common that the scientists at NASA were shocked at how much it resembled a face, knowing it was not an alien artifact. Another reason that we know it is a butte is because it was not only photographed once or twice but three times!\n \n This landform has been photographed by two different spacecraft, the Viking 1 and the Mars Global Surveyor. These spacecraft were spread apart for a span of over 25 years! The Viking 1 picked up the best images it could for itÂ´s time but the much more recent Mars Global Surveyor has a much better and more accurate image of the Â¨FaceÂ¨ than the 1976 photo. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) also took two clear photographs of the landform while the 1976 image is blurry to say the least. In 1976 the image was so fuzzy that no one could tell what was there, which led to reporters and authors to excite the public more than what was necessary.\n \n In 1976 authors and reports hyped up the find of this Â¨FaceÂ¨ on Mars. Authors did this to draw more attention to Mars, which because NASA serves the interests of the people and the government was an outstanding thing but it went to far. After all a face on a planet not all that far from us makes a great headline. Not everyone exaggerated it though NASA, as said in the article, upon releasing the pictures to the public stated Â¨huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â¨ The face on Mars was also used in afilm and in countless magazines across the country.\n \n The Â¨Face\" on Mars is merely just shadows playing tricks on the eye. The Face is merely a landform with shadows in all the right spots playing an illusion on those who see it. Over the years many claims, false or true, have been made about the Face on Mars and they aren going to stop anytime soon. So far no evidence supports the claims of conspiracy theorists, however that doenÂ´t mean they never will. The Â¨FaceÂ¨ on Mars has had many stories told about for over two and a half decades, and they are not going to stop anytime soon, but it is important to know that science has not proven anything about the Â¨FaceÂ¨ on Mars, yet.",

    essay: "The Face\" Is Not A Face\n \n The 1998 dicovery of, the Face has gotten its fair share of publicity throughout numerous years. This photo that was taken on NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, as it was searching for possible landing sites. This \"face\" is nothing but a natural landfrom that happens to look like a face. There are many persuasive and factual reasons to back up the fact that there has been no alien formation on Mars.\n \n First, there has been no real, hard evidence that this human-like figure is actually a face. The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" even says,\"it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" (Notice, it said likeness.) Just because one article and a Hollywood movie says that this was alien created, doesn't mean it really was.\n \n Also, any natural landforms can look like something it is not. Have you ever looked at a rock or even a cloud and said, \"Wow, that looks like a [insert object or name]!\" There have been plenty of instances in which something has been mistaken to be someting it is not. For example, The Little Dipper, as we call it, is said to look like a spoon. Does that mean that there is a big, shiny spoon in the sky? Of couse not, so why should we say the same about a formation of rocks on Mars that happen to look like a face.\n \n Lastly, NASA has even confirmed that this is just a natural rock formation. I know this because, NASA unveiled an image of this \"face\" and captioned it, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" So, this rock's shadows have given the illusion of a human-like face, which leads to the assumption that there is no real face.\n \n You might be thinking,\" Well, why did the people who discovered this even release the information if it wasn't comepletely factual.\" This is beacuse of the conspiracy theorists. Think about it , if you would have never heard about this Face on Earth in books, magazines, and radio talk shows, would you have believed it? NASA is a very trustworthy and credible association and if information wasn't released until it was proven true than none of this would have happened.\n \n In conlusion, the Face on Earth is nothing but a myth, until there are reliable discoveries that have declared it real. Since there is no evidence that there has been alien formation on Earth, it is just a hoax. I hope I have given a sufficent amount of reasons to argue that the Face is not a face.",

    essay: "Recently we have discovered a new landform on Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture of a martian mesa, these are very common. These martian mesas are similar to the ones on Earth. They are very common in Cydonia, a region on Mars. Many conspiracy therorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is not true.\n \n The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large mesa-like landform with the face an Egyptian god on it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any other one. The reason it looks like a face is because shadows were being cast onto it to make it appear like it had eyes, a mouth and a nose.\n \n In 1998, a camera captured another picture of the formation. It was a little cloudy on the day they took the picture, so we went again to capture another picture. This time in April of 2001, we used a much better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was much more detailed and clear. Once we zoomed in it looked like any other landform we might find. In paragraph 11 Garvin states, Â¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see them!Â¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is no alien activity near this landoform.\n \n In conclusion, it is clear that the Â¨Face on MarsÂ¨ wasnÂ´t created by aliens. We took a much more defined picture and found nothing. Not to metion the fact that there is no water on Mars, so it canÂ´t support life. Very very few of the scientists beleive that this was created by aliens. Everything can be explained by science in this picture.",

But to others it may seem like aliens did do it. But they think what they want but aliens don't exist.\n \n The face is not that big of a deal. The face is a way for organizations to sell their products. As it says in the fifth paragraph, \"The 'face on mars' has become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\". All the face is is sand that has been moved around by sand storms and now it looks like a face nothing fun about it. All I'm saying is the face is not as great as it once seemed.\n \n Even though the face really means nothing, some people thinkthat the face was made by life on mars. They say that they made it to show that they were there. \"The face is bona fide evidence on mars\". But we also know that sand storms are very common on Mars, how could it not just be one of those that did it?\n \n The face is not as amazing as everyone was making it out to be.

    essay: "While the Face on Mars does look like a face, there is no way possible that it could be an alien artifact. Research, advance in technology, quotes from scientists, and actual evidence proves that this is just a natural landform on Mars. Mars has had plenty of speculation on this, yet all the answers have come back that it is impossible. No, there is not a lot of evidence, but there is enough to show that this is just a mesa.\n \n When scientist first found the Face, it was already speculated to be a mesa. This was because of the place where it was located, Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having many mesas in its area. This one just happened to have shadows on it appearing like a face. Let us not forget that the Face was found in 1978. That is when space travel was still a new for the world. Technology was not that advanced as it is today. The last picture was taken in 2001, which was twenty years later after the first photograph was taken. Spacecraft and photos had improved twice as much.\n \n Even though technology has improved we still cannot tell whether it is an alien or not. We must go off of facts. Scientist Jim Garvin stated that,\"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, id there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could not see what they were!\" This shows that the Face could not even of been seen. So, it is impossible that it was an alien artifact.\n \n Mesas and buttes are very common on Mars. Especially in Cydonia. Technology has improved and there is no way we could see a face from that size. \"That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars,\" said Garvin. Research and results have proven that the Face is just a landform like any other on earth.",

Yet they were incorect. NASA has now said that it is just a natural landform and has evedince to prove it as well.\n \n In paragraph 3 it talks about how the fce is just a natural landfor. Saying it is just a rock formation. Also it says that the shadows just give it the illoution of being a face. Which means the sun has cast shadows on the rocks and the way the rocks were formed it made the shadows fall in the wholes appering to be a face when it really isn't.\n \n In paragraph 7 it says that there is no alien mounuments. Proving most theroy's wrong. They found this out by taking another photo with a better liense so they can soom in and see what is really there. By doing this they found no alie monuments and that it is just a land formation as NASA origonaly belived.\n \n Also in paragraph 12 it says the face is equivilant to mesa or buttle. Which means that it is compare to mesa and buttle wich are both natural landforms on Earth. Also in this paragraph it was proven that the rocks were created by lava. So now it is considered a lava dome.\n \n So over all scients now belive that it is just a natural landform and that there is no aliens ther and that there never was.

    essay: "When the Viking 1 discovered the face on Mars, many people believed that the face was created by aliens. Forty years later, those consperacies remain in the minds of many people who do not belive NASA when they say, \"It's just a mesa.\" NASA has sent three objects to Mars, the Viking 1 the Vinking 2, and a MGS, in which all three have been able to locate this face shaped messa in a area called Cydonia. Each time the face become a little less noticiable but stil noticable enough to find.\n \n On April 5th, 1998, the MGS along with Michael Malin and his Mars Obriter Camera flew over Cydonia for the first time. They were albe to snap a picture ten times sharper than the one taken in 1976. The picture was uploaded to the internet, where thousands of wed surfers wher waiting to see what it revealed. to many their theory had been proven to be correct, while others still thought it was a alien built structure. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was satisfied with the outcome. Some skepticcs said that alien marking were hiden by the haze. The pictures were taken at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet, causing the Mars Global Surveyor to have to peer through wispy clouds in order to see the face.\n \n The skeptics were right when they said that they had to peek through haze, however they were wrong about the part where they said the haze hid the alien markings. On April 8th, 2001, just three years after the Viking 2 found the face, another mission to Mars reached its location. the 8th of April was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The MGS was able to draw close enough for a second look at the face. Garvin said, \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the feld of view. Milin\"s team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Each pixil in the 2001 imge sans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. He went on to say, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes in the groud or Egyptian-styl pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By saying that, Garvin proved all those speculations about the face being an alien structer, are false.\n \n What the picture actually shows, is not a alien civilation, but is the Martian equivalent od a butte or messa. Buttes and mesas are common landforms around the American West. Garvin addedthat it reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He then explained,\"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.\"\n \n After the first picture of the face on Mars was released to the public, NASA explained the picture is just, \"a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" It was later added that it is just another Martian mesa,, common around Cydonia. The only difference that seperates this one form the rest are unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\n \n Like the man on the moon, the face on Mars is only a structure that resembals the humans that run Earth. The accidental resemblance is quite astonishing to say the least, thought nevertheless, in reality its \"just anouther Masa\" made by nature not aliens.",

    essay: "Have you seen the Grand Canyon? Then you probably know that it was not Pual Bunyon who made it, water carved out the Grand Canyon. Nature makes all of the landmarks that we have. Nature can also make landmarks on other planets as well. This is why the Face on Mars has to be a natural formation.\n \n To begin with, I know that the face is a natural landform because it resembles something in the United States. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, thought that the Face resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also said it was a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars. This shows that even one of the top leaders of NASA's Mars Exploration Program believes that this Face is only a natural landform. Besides, NASA would want to find aliens to prove that there is life on Mars.\n \n Equally as important, nobody has proved that there is any other living thing on a planet except for Earth. Mars is too far away from the sun, and there is very little to no oxygen on the surface of Mars. Even if there is life on Mars, it would be mircoscopic organisms, and they could not build a large structure like the Face. This is another reason why the Face is a natural landform.\n \n And finally, if the Face was made by aliens, then wouldn't there have to be some kind of civilization or living area. The aliens would probably want to be somewhat close to their great formation. However, nobody has located any type of civilization on Mars. With the more powerful that NASA had on the latest probe, they said that you could have see things as small as a shack. Plus, if the aliens built one landmark, why not build another one, but nothing else out of the ordinary has been found by scientists. Lastly, nobody has seen a civilization, so the Face could not have been built by aliens.\n \n In conclusion, there is no strong evidence that the Face on Mars is built by aliens. All the facts point to the idea that the Face is just a natural landform. Scientists took planty of pictures of the Face, trying to find whatever made the Face, but they have found nothing. Besides, there is a natural formation that resembles the Face which proves that they both probably formed the same way. Plus, NASA would want there to be living things on another planet besides Earth, but even they reject the idea that the Face was made by aliens. All this shows why the Face on Mars is only a natural landform.",

    essay: "So, you think that this face on mars, was made by an Alien? Well you thought wrong. There are many reasons why this was not made by an alien. It could be the formation of the land on mars or spacerocks hit it, or it could even be something from inside mars. You dont always know. But Im going to explain why.\n \n Scientist have already went up and discovered this face on Mars because at one time, a lot of people though it was a face made by aliens. Everyone was so excited to see pictures and everything. But some of the information in this article thinks otherwise. In paragraph 7 in this article, it explains how Michael Malin, flew over mars and captured sharper pictures of this \"face. \" But it soon revealed that it was not made by Aliens, it was just a natural lanform and there was no Alien Monuments.\n \n A lot of people were dissapointed, but like I said anything could of happend. The people from NASA took a bunch of pictures and did a lot of tests on it and the picture pretty much said the same thing all along. Plus, Aliens were alive 1000 years ago, if that and so why would people think that they would choose mars, out of all the other planets, and burry an alien in Mars, and it all the sudden show back up. Now do you really think this is true? Now I think it is just a formation in land like the article said.\n \n In the article, some people think that the Alien markings were hidden by haze. Thats a logical reason but I still dont think it is realistic enough. If the haze did not show up in the picture that they took, how could they of not saw it. Plus the Article says that the picture that was most recently took, the lenses on the camera was 10 times sharper and better than the photos that the Vikings photo.\n \n Near the end of the Article it talks about how they even went back again that was even better than the 2 pictures before and that zoomed in so you could see every little detail. Then again it came back with the same results. It was a land formation. They think that it was just a lava dome and has the same formation.\n \n So with all of fthat information I think it is pretty reasonable to say that there was no Aliens on Mars and there deffinataly is not a face from them. This could happen on any other planet to. All along it was just a land formation. At the beggining of the Article I also thought that it was a face from the Aliens too but then I went through the article and there is no possible way. Land forms on its own. So with that being said I guess mars formed with a face on it. Plus rocks and stuff could of made the indents in the face to make it look like eyes.\n \n I hope that was a agreeable argument that aliens were never on mars and proably will never be again.",

Through the passage and its comparrisons, we can infer that the \"face\" on Mars is, in face, just made up of natrual causes and the impact of the weather. If you really think and dig deeper, the picture of the face could resemble moutains or small hills posted, or positioned, relativly close together so that the image of a face is possible.\n \n Lastly, the reason as to why Cydonia is in fact just a landform is the way that the author writes the passage. NASA very briefly mentions the possible outcome of aliens, but other than that nothing else has been said about the \"could be\" creatures. They must not be firm believers. Which leads me to the conclusion that is, if NASA had discovered aliens wouldn't that make them most popular? The discovery of new life would, without a doubt, be absolutly fantastic for NASA and its image. The thought that there might be life on Mars is a good enough situatiion to lie and say that you did find life only to have your buisness in the tabloids. We can all infer that is if NASA had discovered that Cydonia had been built by aliens American citizens would be the first to know. You cant hide something like this that would make your buisness so sucsessful.\n \n In conclusion, we can infer that Cydonia is, in fact, a landform of some sort on the face of Mars. We know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natrual causes, not aliens, and that if the face were to be built by aliens it wouldn't be hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple buisnesses.",

How can they say it was created by aliens when we dont know that aliens are real.

I do believe that it looks like a human face but Mars has sand storms and gets hit by craters all the time and that may be the reason why there is a face on mars.\n \n As we can see in the pictures in 1976, the face looks better then the other pictures. In 2001, the face is gone because of the snadstorm that they had and covered the face. They have no proof that aliens had something to deal withit. They had no foot prints , no sign of an alien, and It looks like to me that t was created by it self. NASA's has no right to say that the face was created by aliens if they have no sign or proof that it was. They don't have proof that aliens are real. That only leads to one conclusion which is that the face on Mars is a land formation.\n \n Therefore, Is the face on Mars created by aliens or is a land formation? The pivtures explain nothing but that it is a land formation. Why? Their is no evidence that it was created by aliens nor anything else. The only way that it would've been created by aliens if NASA's had proof that there were some type of tracks of aliens. They didn't have anything so it leads to one solution.

    essay: "The Universe is an intruging and undefined place that we have begun to understand. Although we have started the search of other planets, there remains a plethora of information that is still undiscovered. Existing life forms have not yet been proven true on any other planet besides our own, Earth. Based on evidence and scientific understanding of the world we live in, the Face on Mars is a structure created by random chance.\n \n Pictures taken on other planets, including Mars, only tell us to a certain extent what the planet is like. Rock, dust, and crater formations are seen in many areas of planets. Just as with Earth, other planets change throughout time from asteroid collisions, internal movement, and natural occurences. From the era in which we live in, we can only know so much about the planet Mars itself. Just as well, full scale space exploration has only recently become possible with innovation and technology of our society. As seen in paragraph seven, \"Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" This proves to us that new additions to technology have been made in a short time period, from 1976 to 1998, twenty-two years. We can see from this that everything, with a second, more detailed look can change.\n \n In addition to technological improvements and understanding of the universe, our belief in social media and public news is phenominal. We trust in almost everything that news reporters, magazines, websites, and spreading word tells us. Rumors and false reports spread quickly and in a wide range. Also, expounding on existing rumors happens often. When the public heard of the Face on Mars, word of aliens and other beings existing on Mars dispersed through the people of Earth. Many people had believed that NASA was keeping such information in secrecy from the media. As public interest peaked, NASA was persuaded to investigate the landform on Mars once again. The public interest can be seen in paragraph five, \"The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" This shows us that our belief in public reports is true. We believe in what media and others tell us, not always specifically what the source, in this case, NASA tells us.\n \n Lastly, NASA researchers are professionals who work with outerspace accounts everyday. It is more plausible to believe in what they tell us rather than what others tell us. As concluded in NASA's research it is seen in further pictures that the Face on Mars is just a landform. There is no extraterestrial link with picture or Mars.\n \n In Conclusion, Pictures and technology back when the original, Face on Mars, was seen is old and outdated. Newer technology proves to us that the picture just happens to be by coincidence and chance. Social media may spread rumors or false reports and should not always be believed. Public attention should be given directly to the source in which the information has come from. Therefore, NASA's research and conclusions should be of our most interest and paramount importance. The Face on Mars is not of alien origin and is simply just a landform created by chance.",

A couple days later NASA relased the image of the \"face\" to the public the caption was simple as it states in the text, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" After that, it was a pop icon, attracting people into learning more about this planet.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" became very popular when it came to scaring humans. According to the text it states \"It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" In films, as always, Hollywood would \"tweak\" the truth to have more people come and see the movie. This was partly the cause of people believing that there is life on mars. However, astronomers are saying that there could have been life on Mars because, of dry river and lake beds on the surface of The Red Planet. Still, that does not prove that there were marshans.\n \n Astronomers are still trying to convince people that there is not life on Mars. According to the text it states \"What the picture actually shows ins the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" This is showing what it really looks like. Besides, from background knowledge it is not possible for a human to live on Mars. There is no oxygen for us to breathe, no water, and no food. Nothing.\n \n Technology has advanced in the past 25 years, showing us clearer pictures in space. This is incuding the \"face\" on Mars. It will forever be a mystery, but from what astronomers have said it will always be a rock formation.",

    essay: "The landform is clearly not from ancient origin in the enhanced picture of the mesa. It is way too cold for life to exist on Mars or civilization to thrive. Mars has no food, no water, and the climate is harsh most of the time.\n \n There is no oxygen on Mars and there is no way to survive without special equipment. If aliens did exist why would they settle for Mars and not Earth. It is most likely just a natural landform that coincidentally looks like a face. Images show that with enhanced graphics the landform looks nothing like a face.\n \n There are different landforms on Earth that look like faces too. Even if there were ancient structures in Mars they probably were destroyed by the intense storms that happen every day on Mars. Its unlikely that there were aliens that the mesa is from ancient origin considering we don't have proof of aliens yet.",

    essay: "Many people think that the face might have been an alien's. I think that the Face is a natural landform because scientists beleive that the eyes,nose and mouth were cause by shadows. Some scientists believe that the face was an alien artifact. Scientists have used better camera that could even show a small shacks. Some say alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n First, I think the Face was caused by natural landforms because the eyes,nose, and mouth were caused shadows. A few days after the the picture, NASA unveilded the image and the caption noted \"Huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" Some scientists still disagree saying it could have been an alien's face. When looking at the picture, there is a shadow of the rock. If it was an alien, why haven't scientist found any other alien like?\n \n Second, the face was formed by a natural landform because when you look at the 2001 picture it is more clear than 1976 or 1998. The clear version shows that it had no eyes,nose, or mouth. Garvin said \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" Scientists are able to see pictures closer than before. Garvin also said \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" All the new technologies can get the actually picture more clearly unlike the picture from 1976.\n \n Then, scientists have better technoloy, they are able to go to Mar with new machines. Scientists can even go near the Face with new spacecraft adn get a better picture. Other scietists think that alien markings were hidden by haze. Even if they were hidden, scientists would be able to find it by now.\n \n Finally, the Face was formed by natural landform because it was caused by shadows, and scientists have better technology. On 2001, scientists used a camera which were better than the camera they used on 1976. This is why the Face was formed by natural landform.",

    essay: "Twenty five years ago something very uncommon happened on our planet Mars. NASA sent a shuttle taht can take pictures of anything, NASA sent the shuttle out into space. The shuttle NASA sent out was called \"Viking 1\". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the \"Human Face\".\n \n Even though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the \"Face\" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying \"Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide.\" Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.\n \n And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. We were very anxious to see the picture... the picture revealed ... like we said a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\n \n Everyone wasn't satisfied. The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98 which was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camrea on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\n \n So then I ordered mission controllers to look again. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that looks straight down and scans teh planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.\n \n April 8, 2001 coudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough fro a second look. They had to roll the Space craft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the field of view. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking photo. Meaning in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there we objects in this pictures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks youll know where they were.\n \n The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. So they we never alien sights. Even though John never blieved what i said.",

    essay: "The conspiracy about aliens has been starting to go too far. An isolated mesa was found on Mars, but when its picture was taken, it looked like a face. The conspiracy theorists have been thinking that that's the proof that there's life on Mars, but they're wrong. The picture was taken in 2001, which means it was very detailed, so it would've been obvious if there were any tombs or buildings surrounding the mesa. Also, it only looks like a face because of it shadows. The shadows actually shape it into a face. Finally, if it was actually a sign for alien life, it would've profited NASA, so there wouldn't be a point in hiding the \"truth\" that the conspiracy theorists believe. These all show that the Face is just an ordinary rock.\n \n The last picture of the Face was taken in 2001. This was a very detailed picture, even for being taken so long ago. Each pixel in the image was equal to 1.56 meters in real life. This means that any other nearby buildings or tombs would've been seen near the rock. There weren't any buildings or any sign of actual alien life nearby, so the picture at least proved that the Face wasn't a sign from the aliens, but just a rock.\n \n The only reason that the Face looks so much like a face is because of the shadows. Without the shadows, the Face might just look like an ordinary rock on mars. The shadows themself give the illusion of the rock having eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Those shadows are the only reason that the Face IS\n \n the Face.\n \n Without those shadows, the Face wouldn't be so famous. Nobody would have probably ever known or cared about it.\n \n The conspiracy theorists and many people in general probably think that NASA is hiding the fact that aliens are real, so they're lying about the Face and just saying that it's a landform, when they think it's a sign that aliens exist. That's not true. NASA is a company that needs money like all the rest. They know that telling people that aliens were real would profit them a lot, so they wouldn't just hide the fact that the Face was an alien artifact if it was one. NASA probably wishes that they had found an ancient cililization on Mars, just for the profit.\n \n The theorists are wrong about the Face being an ancient artifact. The latest picture of the Face is so detailed, that any ancient civilizations nearby would be visible. Also, the Face is only the Face because the rock has shadows along it that makes it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Finally, NASA would proabably like to find an ancient civilization on Mars, just so that they could profit from finding something related to alien life. They wouldn't just hide the truth if they could gain money from it. Therefore, theorists should just realize that facts are facts, and that if NASA finds an ancient civilization on Mars, they'll tell everyone.",

    essay: "Have you ever seen anything unusual and thought that it was just a natural landform, but other people thing it was created by extraterrestials? Well, some people argue that the Face on Mars was created by aliens and some people believe that it was created natural. I believe that the Face formed naturally. I believe this because of the camera quantity and the shadows and clouds of the planet.\n \n First, I am going to discuss the camera quality. The quality of the camera is important so that the picture of the Face is clear. When the scientists first took the picture of the Face in 1976, there was an unclear picture. As time went on the cameras got more and more advanced that to the point you could see every detail of the Face. In 2001, when scientists took a clear picture of the Face, they identified it as a mesa, a natural landform in Western America. Also, they said that if there were any other alien landforms like egyptian pyramids that it would show up in the picture. Last, in the passage it states, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" This quote from the passage proves that the Face is a natural landform and not created by aliens. This is how the camera quality prove whether or not the Face was created by aliens or is a natural landform.\n \n Next, I am going to discuss how the clouds and shadows of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. First, the shadows of Mars gives the Face an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. In the passage it states, \"Huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, mouth.\" This shows that the Face is not really a face and it is actually a natural landform. Next, the clouds on Mars can throw off the cameras vision of the face. When the MGS took a picture of the Face when it was cloudly on Mars the picture was unclear and scientists could not see the Face in detail. Although, in 2001 when the MGS explored Mars, it was not cloudy. MGS was able to get a clear picture of the Face and scientists identified it as a natural landform and not an alien creation. This is how the shadows and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.\n \n Finally, the camera quality, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. The better the camera quality the more proof there is to say that the Face is a natural landform. Also, without the clouds and shadows of Mars, the Face is easily identified as a natural landform. To conclude, this is how the quality of the camera, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.",

The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you \"supposedly\" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens.

For instance Earth has weather elements such as;rain, snow, hail, and mist. Mecury is the nearest to the sun. Venus is made mostly out of gas. And Saturn as well as Uranus has rings. Neptune is the cold icy planet. Then Jupiter is the biggest planet.\n \n Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artcraft, photograpghing Cldonia became a prority for NASA when Mars Global Surbeyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended. \"We felt this was important for taxpayers,\"explained Jim Garvin.

    essay: "Do you think there are aliens? Well I don't. This unmasking the face on mars is not a alien thing because strange things always happen on earth and different planets. This could just be are pollution is spreding not just in the air but even in space. Or Mars could just be doing what earth does every amount of years earth changes in like the land-scap mars land-scap could just be changing.\n \n On Earth we have weird stuff happen a lot like symbols in corn feilds, some people think they see flying space ships some people are just crazy aliens don't exist. We don't have any proof that aliens exist like just because some cows go missing or found dead doesn't mean they didn't just leave or a wild animal didn't kill them. I don't know how to explaine the corn feilds but the \"flying space ship\" is just a jet or plane nothing big and if people say other people have been kinapped by aliens or saw some aliens they would be lying because aliens don't exist.\n \n Earth today has so many pollution problems rigth now it's just not funny but are pollution could somehow start to spread to other planets because we have air pollution. Air pollution can spread pretty easy so when we like have rocket and go to a different planet we may bring different substances to that planet it's not use to. Or just how we went to the moon the pollution we brougth to the moon could have spreaded all over the galxay.\n \n So we all know how the Earth changes once every speacial year or years but were use to that cause we know it's going to happen. So now there is a new change but not to planet Earth but to Mars it's weird but it's just a planet. Like are it may have some new changes may not this doesn't mean it has to do with aliens. We have traveld or seen with are cameraas in space so many planets but never one trace of aliens or any life form so that means aliens aren't real.\n \n So in conclusion with all the evidence we got from prior knowleged and reading this article there are no other life form on anyother planet just Earth. Also aliens don't exist all the weird things that happen in the world or on different planets all happen because humans do something wrong to the earth. We sometimes get granted the most beautiful things ever or it hits us with earth quakes or hurricans and punishes us so do good to the earth not bad.",

    essay: "Unmasking the Face on Mars is a good way to figure out how and why the face is there. People think it was a type of form of aliens but it wasn't it was put there for attention on the planet mars. NASA wants to hide the fact that they came up with the whole idea of putting attention on mars,and making the whole \"research\" fake and all a lie.\n \n The face is a natural landform because it was there to draw attention to mars which it did. \"The author's reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars which it certainly did\". The face on Mars became a pop up icon. It starred in hollywood films, books,magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines. Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\n \n That's how the face and why the face showed up on mars. It was not any form of aliens. NASA wanted to bring attention to the planet mars,which they did by saying that the face was form of aliens. There was no type of aliens involved, but attention from public was given and all eyes was on NASA and the planet Mars. NASA tried to hide it and it seem as if it didn't work.",

    essay: "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\"\n \n This statement would lead anyone to believe that the details and magnification in a camera 25 years younger and improved would lead to better and more eye capsuring photos right?\n \n Right.\n \n So, why would there be controversey over the likelyhood of the face actually being real?\n \n Here's why: people see something one time and they are automatically drawn into the idea that it has to be real. The Martian Mesa was said to look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. That statement leads people to believe that there had to be life to build something like that. But, with the shadow showing groves perfectly and the holes in the mesa made it look real. The \"Face\" is just another Mesa on Mars.\n \n First, the pixels and the picture produced by the camera at that time weren't as developed as the camera used in 2001. You also have to take into account that, as time goes on, most products will be improved and made better, in this case that's how it was with the cameras, with a 25 year gap in between.\n \n The text says, \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" The text also supports the claim by stating, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n Additionally, the shadows had appeared to be hitting the natural landform just right. The scientists belive this because, they have seen many other mesas while traveling in space, this on just happened to have a interesting impression at first sight.\n \n The text proves this by including, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusoin of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"\n \n The text also says, There must have been a degree of spurise amoung mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"\n \n Believers in this \"face\" may claim there was never a clear picture of the \"face\" taken after the first photo.\n \n To support this they may think that the photographer taking the picture may not be able to see the clouds. The text says, \"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 - a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to the Face.\"\n \n However, NASA was able to take another picture of the Face when the clouds weren't in the way and it wasn't winter. The text says, \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 - a cloudless summer day in Cydonia - MGS drew close enough for a second look. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.\"\n \n The Face captured on Mars has proven to be a natural landform. With shadows covering it and dips to make facial features it can across as an Egyptian Pharaoh. This is proven because, of the high tech cameras and the shadows only lasted one day allowed scientists to prove their claim - the Face was just a normal mesa landform.",

Here are a couple reasons why I think the face is a landform, and not a structure made by aliens.\n \n One reason I think the face is a landform, is because the sand on that planet builds up and increases into a mountain. There are also astroids that strike the planet, making the planet have different size shapes on its surface. Also, there are tectonic plates to move the land.\n \n One other reason I think it is a landform is because, if aliens were to create the enourmus structure, how would they do it and why would they do it? To me, there is no other explanation other than it was created by natural landforms. Also, whos to say that aliens are real or not? It wouldnt matter because even if people said aliens are real, they would need to have evidence explaining why and how aliens accually exist.

    essay: "The face is not created by aliens and here are a few reasons why. It was a mesa, or maybe even a shadow. but aliens is not a logical reason for this face to exisist on mars.\n \n First, A mesa, a mesa is a very common landform found around the American West. Even so there is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, USA. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. If something on the earth can have a mesa about or the same height had the face on mars it is very likely that it was a mesa.\n \n Secondly, shadows We all knows that shadows can be very deceiving just like in this instance. A shadow could have been reflecting off the viking 1 while it was taking this photo of the \"Face\", or maybe the shadows were from a bigger land form. that was infront, behind, or on the sides casting a shadow onto this mesa.\n \n All in all, From these facts you can conclude that this was a natural landform and not some type of alien thing. If you still do not believe that it was natural. Another spaceship went into space and found the \"Face\" and took a very detailed picture and there were no markings or signs of aliens.",

Many people just guess without really having adiquite information. We do have enough information to know that when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Mars and took pictures of the Face it was not Alien made.\n \n We know for a fact that the Face on Mars is not an Alien creation. The first Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) or the Viking 1 took blurry photos of the Face on Mars and we could not clearly see the object. Twenty-five years later the MGS was sent to take better quality pictures of the Face and when it came back, the photos were ten times more sharper than the Viking 1Â´s. Now we could clearly speculate that the Face was just another Mars landform.\n \n On Earth there are simialr landforms like the Snake River in Idaho. We have found that the Face is a lava dome under the surface of Mars. We understand how much of an influence the Media can have and you shouldnÂ´t believe them. Again, they do not have as much information as we do on the Face on mars. Thanks to our new pictures from the MGS, we can safely say that there is no Alien temple or monument on Mars.",

It is a big ovle that looks like it has eyes a face and nose. The face is looking right out into outer space and it has a veiw of the whole solar system. When the NASA spacecraft called Viking 1 taking pictures of spots were its sister ship could land Viking 2 it was if the face was looking at them. There is not a face on mars, it is just a landform with a shadow that makes it look like a face.\n \n There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors.

The Face on Mars is located at forty-one degrees norht martian latitude where it was winter in april '98 a cloudy time of year on the planet. So skeptis said that perhaps the the alien markings were hidden by the haze. \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he added.

    essay: "Imagine it's 1976 and Nasa reveals an interesting photo looking down upon Martian landscape. The photo catches your eye as it contains what apears to be a giaint face made of rock coming out of the sand. Nasa states that the \"face\" is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. But you also hear other people saying that the face is an ancient alien artifact! What do you believe? Pop culture quickly jumps on the idea of aliens because that view point is exciting. Meanwhile NASA is a government backed and very credible source. I say that the educated person would listeto NASA. I believe that the \"face on Mars\" is just another natural landform becasue the face looks just like a butte or mesa does on Earth, NASA's powerful cameras haven't captured anything alien looking on near the face, and becasue the majority of NASA and other creidble scientists don't believe that the face is alien.\n \n According to the article Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the area where the famous picture of the face was taken. There is nothinig unusal or different about this specific mesa exept the shadows on top of it. These shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Mesas and buttes are landforms that are also very common on Earth around the American West. The Middle Butte in Idaho is a an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. I'm sure if pyramids started being discovered on the surface of mars thats one thing, but just a single mesa that looks a bit like a face is no reason to immediatly blame aliens.\n \n Another reason why the face is just a natural landform is because we have seen proof that is nothing but a landform.. On April 8, 2001 which was a cloudless day in Cydonia, another picture of the face was taken with a very powerful camera that used its maximum resolution for the picture. When you look at this picture it is almost hard to immgine a face even being there! The illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth is gone. All that remains in this picture are some cracks and rough edges on the rock structure. To many seeing is believing and this picture has allowed many to see the truth that the \"face on mars\" is nothing but a myth.\n \n Some suporters of the idea that the structure was created by aliens argue that NASA is hiding more evidence and mabey even distorting images that point to the face being built by aliens. This is wrong because alien civilizations would increase NASA's funds and popularity. Also it would be almost immpossible to keep an alien secret from the public with so many immployees knowing. These examples show why the \"face on mars\" is just another natural land formation.",

    essay: "There has been a lot of debate circling wether or not the infamous \"Face on Mars\" is an actual alien made structure of a face or just a natural landform. In my professional opinion its safe for me to assume it is just a natural landform.\n \n Although it resembled a face in the first picture it doesn't necesarrily mean it was created by life forms to look like a face. The only features you can make out on the so-called \"Face\" are deep holes for eyes, a pointed part for the nose, and a line for the mouth. It doesn't have any distinct features. If if was made my martians they most likely wouldn't want a monument of a human's face so what is it supposed to be? I'll you what it is butte or mesa, a natural landform that is common on Earth.\n \n Another reason you know it isn't a face is the camera quality of the first image. The camera quality in 1976 wasn't as advanved as today's technology is. The pictures in both 1998 and 2001 were both much more clear than the original photograph. Although you can make out somewhat of a face it doesn't mean thats what it was. It could have just been a blurry picture.\n \n Conspriacy theorists say it actually was aliens and they made the face but NASA would greatly benefit from finding actual life on Mars. If NASA found legitimate alien lifeforms it could benefit the whole world. If they were non-hostile they could teach us how to make and use their technology. We could learn a lot from them, like why the landforms on their planet resemble faces. NASA has been trying to find alien life for years, if they found it they woudln't deny them and say they don't exist.\n \n There are a lot of people that think it has to be a face. And the pictures are from 25 years apart, so anything could have happened to the landform in that long. Natural wear and tear could have washed across the surface of it and rendered it a natural landform. In all seriousness they could be right but it would take a lot more than 25 years to ruin solid rock.\n \n The \"Face on Mars\" had a good 25 year run. It was mostly scaring people and giving conspiracy theorists ammunition to shoot at the government to try to get us to admit there is other life out there, but its time to face reality. It is not a face. It really is a landform. If there was life on Mars you could see it with the cameras we have today, but sadly, no such luck. It's not a face on Mars, we just have imaginations that run wild with wonder.",

    essay: "Many people are thinking that the \"face\" on Mars is an actual face, or they say it was created by aliens. It was proven very well that it is not an actual face. One it is an rock, two the angle the camera was at cought the shadow of it so it seemed as if it was a face, and three the only reason it was told to be a face was for marketing.\n \n My first reason was because it is a rock on mars. It states in paragraph three that it is a huge rock in formation of a human head. therefore that is one reason it is showing everyone that it is just a rock. The rock over the years has wathered down and it has more crevisises and it is losing the foerm of a face. If there was an actual face barryed under there it would never really lose its true form.\n \n My second reason is that the angle of the camera was so that you can see the shadow and if they just wouldve gotten a better angle you woyld be able to see that there was nothing really there. If you were too also look at othere surroundings you would be able to see that there are many other masas on Mars. It also states that it may have been the pixles in the cameras. If we had the technology we have now when they first found it you would most likely have a better picture of it and be able to see what it actually looked like.\n \n My final reason for it not being a face is that the only reason they continued on the theory of it being a face because they wanted good marketing. So itr seemed as if they kept the theory continued because they wanted to have marketing for NASA. Obviously it worked, because the story stated that they started to have hollywood film it appeared in books, magazines, and even raido talks.\n \n Thoes are my reasonings that the \"face\" on Mars is actually just a rock. It was proven to be just another one of the many rocks on mars, the angle of the camera could've been off, the kept the theory going just for marketing.",

    essay: "A face on mars! NASA found a face on mars that is said to be a natural landform but many think it is alien creation. There are many reasons that shows that claim of it being an alien creation is false for example there have been 3 pictures of the \"face\" the face looks different in each, it is a lava dome, and there is not a reason for NASA to keep it a secret.\n \n In the article they give 3 pictures to look at and in each one the landform looks a little different because of the new advance technology. For example the picture in 1976 yes it does look like a face but that could be just because of the low camera quality at the time of the picture taken. The picture could've been anything at the time a rock formation is and was the logical explanation for this. For example in the second picture taken in 1998 the landform is a little blurry but easier to see and in this picture it doesnt resemble a face at all it was revealed to be a natural landform. The example shows that NASA confirmed that it is just a natural landform and is not an alien creation. It does not even look like a face in the sharper picture take in 1998. The last example is the picture taken in 2001. Many thought that the picture taken in 1998 was not proving anything because it would have been winter in mars so the picture had to be taken through wispy clouds so they went again in 2001 they went on a cloudless summer day. For example in the passage it says,\" Malin's team captured an extra ordinary photo using the camera's absoulte maximum resolution.\" The example shows that NASA took an amazing clear photo revealing that it is just a land form.\n \n In the article there are three different missions. In the first mission they fiqures it was just another common Martian mesa. For example in the text it says,\" Scientist fiqured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows.\" The example shows that they said that it is just mesa with unusual shadows. The next mission sais that it is indeed a natural landform. For example in the story it says,\"Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial viking photos and posted on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform.\" The example shows that the new cameras showed that it was just a landform but that still wasnt enough evidence to some. The third mission was in 2001. For example in the text it says,\" a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" The example shows that this mission was on a cloudless day so there would be nothing blocking the view of the landform. All three missions they all agreed it was just a natural landform\n \n Why would NASA want to hide it and there is enough evidence that it is just a natural landform There would be no reason to \"hide\" if aliens were found. For example in the text it says,\"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars.\" The example shows that if there was a civilzation they would not keep it a secreat because they could get more money to study it and in the long run more money for discovering it. Another example is in the story it says,\" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes ont he ground or Eqyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" The example shows that if there was ancient civilization there they had to live somewhere and we would be able to see their shacks. The last example is in the story it says,\" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" The example shows that it is a butte or mesa and it even looks like the middle butte in the River. There is no way the \"face\" is anything but rocks.\n \n In conclusion there is no evidence what so ever that the landform is an alien creation. There was though 3 missions that have evidence showing that it is a landform, there were three different pictures,and there was no reason for NASA to hide this dicovery. The \"face\" is just a natural landform.",

    essay: "Is it possible that the face on Mars could have been created by aliens? Some people believe that the Face on Mars was formed by aliens; however,\n \n I do not believe that is possible. A few of the pictures taken of the Face on Mars were taken when it was cloudy,but that is the only information that suggests that aliens could have made the face. Many scientists have done extensive research on the Face on Mars, and they have found that it is nothing more than a natural landform in the shape of a face. If you believe aliens formed the face on Mars, then be prepared for multiple facts that go against that belief.\n \n Numerous scientists have studied the area in which the surreal face formation is located, and they have found various mesas. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the place in which you would find the face. Because of these facts, it is believed that the Face on Mars is just another Martian mesa that is coincidently shaped like a face. NASA even captioned one of the pictures saying \"Huge rock formation that was formed by shadows, giving the illusion of a face.\" This explanation makes a tremendous amount of sense more than aliens creating the face.\n \n Although quite a few people vehemetley express their opinions that the face is evidence of life on Mars, NASA says that they are not hiding any information about alien life. Why would NASA keep life on Mars a secret? If life was found on Mars, NASA would share the information because they would make a lot of money from it. They would make history if they had proof of life in Mars! Some defenders of NASA even wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. There is absolutely no way that NASA would turn down that amazing oppurtunity and keep the evidence to themselves.\n \n The picture taken by Michael Malin is another reason to believe that the face was not an alien creation. He took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos by using his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC). The picture taken on April 5, 1998, revealed that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. There was no reason to believe that the face was not natural, but some people still believed that aliensdid in fact make the formation. The tenacious scientists were still determined to find evidence to make everyone see the truth.\n \n April 8, 2001, was a cloudless day in Cydonia, and Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the face to capture a extraordinary photo.\n \n The picture was taken using the camera's maximum resolution. If there were objects in the picture near the face, you could have seen what the objects were. There was nothing unusual aroung the Face on Mars.\n \n The picture shows a Martion equivalent to landforms common around the American West. It reminds some people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is the same height as the Face on Mars. This evidence supports the idea that the giant, face-shaped formation is a natural landform, nothing more, nothing less. Aliens are not even proved to exist, let alone form a landform like this one.",

    essay: "Have you ever wondered if the face on Mars was created by aliens? The face on Mars was not created by aliens it is a natural landform. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team got a picture of the face that was good enough to see that the face had no alien monument.\n \n Some people think the face on Mars is created by aliens or think it's bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Scientist Michael Malin found out the right answer. That the face is a natural landform. The camera Michael and his team used was 10 times better than the one used to take the photo of the face in 1976. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program says \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" That quote shows how good the camera is.\n \n Today, people still belive it was aliens who made the face on Mars. But what they dont know is that its really just a landform, thanks to Michael Malin and his MOC team we now know the truth.",

    essay: "The face that was found on Mars may be made by natural causes. There are many reasons why this odd shaped figure would be made by natural causes, like gust of wind throwing rocks around could make that human like face. Or something that can pick up big boulders and can move them into place. There are many reasons why this face showed up, but aliens are not one of them.\n \n What might have caused rocks to move into place to create this human like face is large gust of wind. Or something that is really strong. Or it could have been a big pile of rock and just formed over the years into a face. In the story \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", there is more then one lump of rock there is two. The second is just not shaped like a face. There are spots everywhere on this planet with lumps of rock. Most of them are formed by erosion. Erosion is the process of being broken down. There could be parts of the lump of rock that wasn't strong enough to hold it's self up. They may have fell in to make the eye shape. The nose could have been another small pile of rock that made it look like a nose. This is from up high it may look different down low. It may look like a big piece of rock. There are different views or angles you can look at it.\n \n Other people may think that aliens did this. But there was no traces or marks left behind that can detect an alien. In the story it says, \"There was no alien monument after all.\" Now in the story it says that all the traces of the alien that did this were covered in haze. In paragraph 12 it says, \"\n \n What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\"\n \n They strongly agree that this is just natural causes. Now they are probably still doing some testing or research about this face. But they strongly agree that it is just a natural cause. Formed by erosion,or gust of winds,or even soft spots.\n \n They shape is another crazy thing added on the list of things that NASA sees on different planets. This is just another figure made by the planets natural causes. Thats why NASA believes it was made by natural causes and nothing like aliens. This is just another cool object found on a planet.",

    essay: "In May of 1976, a space ship that was looking for a landing site on Mars snapped a very interesting photo. The blurry photo clearly resembled a human face. The picture led a lot of people to think that the structure was build by aliens. However, this statement has been proven wrong by scientific evidence. The structure wasn't built by aliens because a more up to date photo of the same spot has proven that it is just a mass of rock.\n \n Up until around 1998, a large amount of people believed that the image of the blurry face was evidence of an alien civilization. On April 5, 1998 however, scientists were finally ale to take another picture of the same spot with more up to date technology. The new image revealed that it was just a bunch of rocks.\n \n Scientists say that the blurry face could've been caused by a thick haze that was on that part of the planet when the original photo was taken. They said it was a cloudy day when the photo was taken, so the fae could've been created by the combination of the clouds and the shadows.\n \n Now that a more up to date photo was released, some people have dropped the whole idea of an alien civilization, however, some people still believe that there could still be alien life elswhere. This could be true, but as for the blurry face photo, it was all just a trick of the eye.",

On the other hand, there are people that beleive it is just a mesa, \"landorrms common around the American West.\" There are many people in both parties, making for a huge \"debate.\" The most logical, however, is that the Face is naturally occuring, due to the evidance that NASA has been able to uncover.\n \n The people that say it is an ancient civilization use illogical evidance for their conclusions, such as, \"alien markings were hidden by haze.\" However, the people that believe it is naturally occuring use stable evidance, including, \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This evidance shows that the best technology we have shows nothing more than, \"a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\"\n \n Another way to show that the Face on Mars is naturally occuring is the comparison to the lanforms here on Earth, such as the mesa landforms in the American West.

    essay: "The 'Face' in Space\n \n The Face is a bonafide example of a natural landform. However, some people say that it is an ancient artifact that proves that there is life on Mars. Scientists have said that the Face is just another buttle or Martian mesa, that the Face is just another natural landform and there isn't a face at all. It is just a common landform.\n \n Even if the masses aren't satisfied, the Face will remain just a buttle or Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Cydonia, the place where the Face was found. The Face only has shadows that make it appear like a face. Conspiracy theorists say that the Face might be evidence of ancient civilization on Mars, but defenders of NASA's budget beg to differ.\n \n Truly, the face is just a natural landform.\n \n As the text states \"There wasn't an alien monument after all.\"The passage also reads that Malin sent a team to capture a more clear picture of the Face. Some said that there might have been hidden alien markings, and they were proven wrong. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to get a clear picture of the Face. As it turns out, there really wasn't a alien monument after all.\n \n In the beginning, there was no face to begin with. The Face only had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see and here in the passage it reads \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.\" This shows that there wasn't a face, just an illusion.\n \n There is the arguement that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization. At the time the picture of the Face was taken, it was winter. Perhaps the alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze. Mission controllers even looked again. On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Cydonia.\n \n In conclusion, the Face turned out to be a common landform. Just another buttle, another landform, another rock formation, not really a face at all. There is no evidence that there was even a civilization and there wasn't even evidence that there was life to begin with! Again, there could have been alien markings that were covered by the haze, and there could have been life on Mars. Let us face the facts though; in this reality; there isn't a face on Mars, there isn't a civilization on Mars and it is just another landform.",

There are diffrent reasons on why that image is there, besides \"aliens\" put it there. It could be butte mesa. Also cameras sent in space would have picked up on something unusual. Scientist don't present a theory unless they have evidence to back it up.\n \n One reason that the \"face on mars\" is there, is butte mesa. Which is usually shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Butte mesa are found in West America, one example of the butte mesa is in Snake River Plain of Idaho. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. The mesa located in Idaho is about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n \n Another thing, is that cameras are sent into space to take pictures of planets and record everything that is found. Scientist enlarge the photos 3 times bigger, to see everthing within it. If there were anything in the picture that seemed unusual, the cameras would allow you to see it. Any objects, like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyrsmids. Even small shacks, you would be able to see it.\n \n Thirdly, scientists don't present a theory unless they have gone threw precautions and looked over all of there evidence to support the theory. In the article it talks about how the scientists, sent two diffrent cameras up to make sure the clouds wren't the issue of what they saw. Also, they blew the images up to see if there was an objects. To make sure that nothing could endanger there theory, of it just being a butte mesa. If the scientists really didnt believe there theory was valed, they would'nt have taken so many precautions.\n \n In conclusion, the \"Face on Mars\" is probably just a naturally occuring landform on Mars. With the evidence of the butte mesa in West America. The cameras going up and taking pictures more than once. Also, the scientists taking many precautions to prove that the \"Face on Mars\", is a butte mesa. The theory that the \"Face on Mars\", is just a naturally occuring landform, is highley likley.",

    essay: "Many people believe this very famous \"Face on Mars\" was indeed created by aliens. We've been hoping for explanations of this and possibly another alternative than the Face just being a landform on Mars. Although, after reading the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", NASA had indeed found an explanation that shows the Face is surely not created by aliens, but it is just another natural landform that we have discovered.\n \n First of all, the Face has been discovered as a natural landform because NASA scientists even said, \"There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just anohter Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" Even though the face caused much excitement between the scientists, we as the scientists needed to face the fact after all the research and pictures that showed the Face was not something extravagant the aliens on Mars had created. So even though the Face gained much popularity commercially, it was just another landform like the many other ones on that planet.\n \n Also, finding out their was ancient civilization or aliens currently on Mars would benefit NASA greatly, as it would be seen as a huge accomplishment. The article states, \"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" My question is for you, why would NASA try to cover up or hide that they indeed found aliens or life forms creating things on Mars? NASA spent a long time taking pictures and doing research to look at this kind of stuff, even though something like this would be a huge event in all of history. It would become a great accomplishment for NASA and they would definitely want to share what they have discovered. When they first found the Face, NASA gained popularity from commercials and it became an icon. So if the Face was indeed created by aliens, NASA would gain even more popularity, if they thought the face was anything more that a landform after all the pictures and research.\n \n Finally, the area that the Face was discovered in a common place for those landforms. The article says, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.\" Even though it caused a great surprise, the scientists soon realized it was just another landform, which they the sensation was over. Don't worry though, a few scientists did actually believe the Face was an alien artifact, but let me tell you, they were wrong. \"On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camers team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious websurfers were waiting when the imagine first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" So as you can see, those scientist were proved wrong by that picture that proved there was no actual alien monument, as they believed so.\n \n In conclusion, I hope I have convinced you with the evidence from over the years involving the unmasking of the Face on Mars. The Face was not created by aliens because NASA would not hide the information, there is signifact pictures evidence to prove this argument, and the Face was in a common place for things like those to be found, in a place called Cydonia. NASA worked on it for years, trying to find the truth, only to find they had discovered another natural landform. Also, even though some scientists may have thought there could be alien artifacts and it was created by the aliens on Mars, they soon realized what the Face truly was.",

    essay: "There have been conspiracy theories going around that the Face on Mars is actually created by aliens, but it can be proven to everyone that the claims are false. The Face is simply a natural landform, and NASA is not trying to hide or distort the truth. Some may still be skeptical, but there is proof that the Face is not an alien monument of any sort.\n \n As stated before, the Face is actually a natural landform. It's the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa found commonly in the American West. Fellow researcher, Jim Garvin, even states that it reminds him of the \"Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\"(paragraph 12). It can be proven that Earth landforms definitely aren't made from aliens, and the same could be said for the Face.\n \n The Face isn't even an actual face, so it's unlikely it even is an alien monument. The only reason the rock formation resembles a face is because the shadows cast an illusion of facial features such as eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Pictures of the Face were captured two other times using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Skeptics may believe that NASA messed up somewhere or that something was flawed, but it is highly unlikey that this is true. The procedure was performed on a cloudless summer day with the best camera at NASA's disposal.\n \n Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face wasn't created by aliens, believing that NASA is just attempting to hide the evidence of an ancient civilization. In truth, this is false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life. How can one believe NASA is keeping secrets about alien life from the public when it would benefit to do the opposite. Proof of an alien civilization would be more helpful to share than hiding it, so why do people believe otherwise?\n \n Whether or not people believe the Face is actual just a Martian landform, it doesn't affect the researchers of NASA. Evidence to support the claim has been provided, but what proof do the skeptics have? Can they really disprove the truth or are they just desperate for attention?",

Second, if it could prove aliens once lived, or currently live on Mars, then NASA would not hesitate to publish it.

This rock formation is much like what we have on Earth. The shadows cast upon the rock, giving it facial features. On a different day, those shadows are not there.\n \n Why would NASA keep this a secret? NASA would thrive from finding alien lifeforms. Why would they keep that private. As the story states, \" Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" They want that, because their budget would increase and they could do better projects if they had published it.\n \n Nerws articles claimed it was a rock formation long before any conspiracy theories were out.

    essay: "Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed \"Face on Mars\". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.\n \n First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now. Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface?\n \n Additionally, even if NASA had found this further evidence, why would the company try to hide it? Not only would releasing such infrormation to the public leave NASA with all sorts of world renouned achievements, it would be more than beneficial for the company's financial standpoint. Releasing statements as big as signs of life on Mars would do wonders for the company. The more achievements, the more sponsors will see the potential in investing money in a program such as NASA. Adding to that, the more sponsors, the more projects NASA can fund, and by extension, the more the foundation will be able to learn and teach the public.\n \n Probably the most obvious piece of evidence that busts the idea of unknown life, is that these photos were taken in 1976 (according to paragraph 5 of Unmasking the Face on Mars) . Technology at that time was still fairly primitive, especially for space travel. The photo just happened to be taken at the right time, at the right angle, by a pilgrim piece of technology. Further pictures, such as the ones taken in 2001, reveal that the \"face\" is just a mesa, with next to no details that resemble that of a human complextion. Think of it as the\n \n \"...Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...\" (paragraph 12)\n \n All in all, this \"face\" on Mars is no different from other conspiracies. Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the \"Bigfoot\" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence. The face on Mars is simply a clump of rock, nothing to be even slightly concerned about. Unless, of course, you are an individual who likes to be concerned about clumps of rock.",

It is just a land formation because, shadows are making up its nose, eyes, and mouth. Others believe it is a butte or a mesa, which are land formations around the American West. The image of the \"face\" looks just like a hill or rounded very small mountaion top. The \"face\" even has changed over the years. Many things change by erosion or the weather,so i believe it is just a mesa that has changed over the years. The markings were not hidden by some kind of an \"alien haze\" it was simply the weather. Planets other than earth have diferent kind of weathers also. There is something in the United States that is simulaur to the \"face\", it is a small lava doom and it is the same height as the \"face\".\n \n Scientist believed that there is somekind of an alien face on Mars, but there isnt it is just a mesa or a butte. Which is a small landmass. If there was an ancient civilization or still life on Mars, we would be able to see it, unless they are just great at hinding. Even if there were civilzations on Mars wouldn't we be able to see more artifacts? The land mass has also changed in the pass years, probably by ersion or wether. There is also shadows that are reflectind over the land mass, to show its distinct characterristics, like the nose, mouth, and eyes.",

    essay: "NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took photos of Mars, as many as they could for their sister ship Viking 2. It spotted a likeness of a human face, it was nearly 2 miles long from a reigon of Mars called Cydonia. The appereance of this supposible face caused a lot of suprise from NASA and common people. Scientists thought nothing of it as a face only a possible Martian mesa. Some thought of this creation on Mars as a face others thought of it just as a landmark on the planet.\n \n The face got a alot of publicity from the people that thought it was real and also the people who didnt. In my opinion I would like to think of it as a artifact of the other possible beings but I cant bring myself to think that it's real. \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\" Now I can believe that, even though I often dream of far off places and creatures like the vampires in Lost Boys or the Goblin King I can't bring myself to believe that that is a artifact.\n \n Science most of the time has a solution to what things are while some think it's a thing of signifigance like another race of space people it's not, it's just a rock formation that happened and will happen again. The world endlessly enjoys tricking us with things like this, aliens, vampires, werewolves, sea monsters, and zombies. They are all in the same boat even they don't always seem like they are. The face is a hoax but that doesn't mean aliens don't exist. It means we need to expand our horizons, make our technology better, have brighter imaginations, support those with different yet logical ideas, and find out what the universe and planet hold hidden from us. Some of the best things are things we can't see after all.",

    essay: "In 1976 the Viking 1 aircraft that circled and took pictures of mars looking for potential landing sports for future aircrafts found a shaodwly likeness of a human face on mars. Some scientists believed it to be unnatural and made by ancient civilization on mars. The more reasonable option was that it was just another Martian mesa which are commonly found on the part of mars called Cydonia.\n \n Nasa has proven the face on Mars to be a butte or mesa, common landforms that are found on Earth. On April 5th, 1998 the aircraft Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The Mars Orbiter Camera team or MOC took a picture with a way higher amount of resolution than the first one. \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\"\n \n Even after proving the public wrong about this conspiracy many were still not satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter on Mars at the time when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Therefore some people believed that the alien markings were hidden by the clouds.\n \n On April 8th, 2001 whatever hope people had that the Martian face was made by aliens Nasa threw away. \"It was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.\" The MOC team took an extraordinary photo of the face a million times better than the past two. \"What the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West.\"\n \n In conclusion The conspiracy on The Face On Mars was yet only a conspiracy and proven so by Nasa. The picture only showed the equivalent of a butte or mesa according to Nasa, thanks to the Mars Global Surveyor which took a picture in maximum resolution. \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.",

    essay: "The year is 2041, and astronaut Jeff Goudard has just landed in the region of Cydonia. He is extremly exited becouse he will be the first human to see the only alien artifact known to man. As soon as he lands, he sees the face. Jeff's jaw drops practically to his feet. He relizes the \"Face on Mars\" is really just a plain old mesa, just like the ones out in the American West. Now just like this astronaut, there are probably hundreds of people that think that the \"Face on Mars\" is some sort of alien monuent, but in reality science and logical thinking has proven that in reality, the \"Face on Mars\" is really just a Mesa almost identical to the ones found out in the American West.\n \n First off is the logical thinking portion. In the region of Cydonia mesas are incredibly common.\n \n Now this particular mesas is oddly shapped, I will give it that, but it is just a mesa. What gives it human fetures is just the shadows. Just look at 1976 Viking one photograph. You can clearly see shadows Just look slightly below it, you can see a long shadow protruding from the mesa. Now on the flip side, look at the picture captured on 1998 when it was cloudy out and there were no shadows at all. The image just makes it look like a weird rock, not like a human face at all.\n \n While still on the topic of the photographs, the one snapped on 2001 also proves that the so called \"Face on Mars\" is really just a mesa becouse of not the actual formation, but the surronding area. It was taken by a very high quality camera. In fact, it's pixles spanned 1.56 meters whereas the best Viking photograph the pixles spanned 43 meters. That ment that you could zoom in around the area of the mesa to scan if there was any other evidence of alien life. So scienteists and analysts could scan the sourrounding area for pyramids or buildings, but they found absolutly nothing that would sugest that aliens are present in the region.\n \n Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret. I mean, NASA is really short on funding, but if it was proven that there was aliens on Mars, then that would mean NASA funding probaly would go through the roof. What better goal could NASA have then to make conatact with extratrestrialls. This must mean that the \"Face on Mars\" is just another mesa. What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding.\n \n So just face the facts. The \"Face on Mars\" is just a mesa that had well placed shadows that are one in a million. So don't be Jeff the astronaut, and just face the facts early on as oposed to having high hopes and dreams just to have them crushed by even more scientifically proven evidence. If you don't remember anything from this article, remember this: don't be Jeff.",

I think that the face on mars is just the background for a couple of reasons. These are my reasons.\n \n First, it is impossible for there to be aleins because there is no water. Every living organism needs water. Another reason why it cannot be aliens is that when they did a close up they didnt find anything. The camera was special because it caught even the smallest of things. For example, if there was some sort of shack, this camera's lens could spot it, as said in paragraph 11. Another reason why i think that this could just be a coincidence is that every planet has oddly shaped landmarks. For example, earth has rocks hat are all placed in a circle in Ireland.\n \n In conclusion, this why I think that this face on mars is just a coincidence and a landmark.

Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.\n \n First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.\n \n The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.\n \n The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 \"What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West.\" Then to prove it even more it says this. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar.\" So that just said that these \"faces\" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.\n \n These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.",

This lead many people to believe that there really was life on mars. Many conspiracy theories formed. People believed now more than ever that life exsisted on Mars.

    essay: "Some people say that \"The Face on Mars\" is something that was built by ancient aliens, much like the theories that people come up with about the structures on Earth. Some people have even stated that the \"aliens\" could be trying to cover it up by hiding it during the time they take it. Then there are the firm believers that this is just a land mass that consists of the surroundings and resembles a mesa type biome. Since there have been developments over time, showing the different variations of the \"face\" and what it has become over the years. There are different arguements and different points of view, but there are different time periods with different variations of the same thing, so it will be proven that is is a natural land mass, and not a martian made structure.\n \n There is a lot of things that points toward this being a natural land mass and that it is not a Martian made structure, or that the Government is trying to cover it up. One thing that shows that it is a natural structure is when the article states, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia...\" This means that there are multiple things like this, but the only things that make this one different is the fact that is has \"unusual shadows\" in it that make it look human or like a structure that was built. After this happened and people got news of it and figured out it wasn't real, the Conspiracy Theorists came out and made it seem like a cover up, but this isn't true, because NASA could have gotten publicity from it, as well as many funds. This mesa is no different from anything that we have in Western United States, there we have many mesas that could look equally as strange, but we don't bother, because we want to believe that there is other life, or that there is something strange going on in other planets.\n \n Over the years, the images of this land mass have gotten more and more clear, and we have come to realize, that no, it is not a face, but it is a large point with shadowy parts in it. From the picture from 1976, it is really blurry, and you can't really tell what it is, which is what got people hopes up and thought it may be a structure, due to the shadows and the formation around it. The 1998 one is a bit clearer, but it still is a bit unclear of what it is or could be, because it does look like it could be something like the Sphinx in Egypt, but with the same formation around it. The 2001 image looks way more clear, and this one shows something completely different than what we expected, it is just a regular mesa, with cracks, dips and shadows, and the same formation around it as before. There is something you can tell about the 2001 picture though, if you look closely, it is the same image as all the others, because you can see the dips in it where the \"eyes\" and \"mouth\" are, just more clear so they don't really show up, and since everything is more clear, you can see the cracks, which could have added to the effect.\n \n Even after all of the theories that were made, and NASA defending themselves, as well as people trying to prove them wrong, and prove that there was something that the government did to cover it up. All of this could still be fought, who knows, there could be life out there somewhere besides on Earth, but as of now, there is no proof, and this image will still remain a natural land structure. Some people are dissapointed by this, others are motivated to keep moving and possibly one day find some signs of life, so maybe humans would be prepped and set in case of disaster. There is nothing wrong with personal opinions, but for the most part and from what pictures and plenty of evidence have proven, this is still no more than a natural occurence do to the way land forms over time. So even though people may keep looking for any signs of something that could be a conspiracy, or you just want to find something \"supernatural\" or strange, but the fact stands that there are many thing like this, and just because it is on a different planet, does not make it anymore special, and it doesn't make it any different.",

Over the years there has been speculation that this \"face\" was created by aliens. But over the years new equiptment has revealed the \"face\" for what it is: a mesa.\n \n There are three key points of evidence that disprove the alien theory: the equiptment first used to photograph the Face on Mars is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the sky was clear on Mars when the 2001 image was taken, and Earth has similar landforms on its surface.

    essay: "The \"Face on Mars\" is a famous landmark on, you guessed it, Mars! Many people believe that it is just a natural landform, but others believe it was created by aliens. Why do people believe that it's created by aliens? Well, they believe that the Face is bona fide proof that there is life on Mars, and NASA is hiding something from us. In my personal opinion, I believe that it's just a natural landform that just happens to look like a face. I think that because I think the odds of aliens creating a face on Mars out of no where is very illogical. So in this essay, I'm going to prove to you that the \"Face of Mars\" is actually a landform instead of an actual alien artifact!\n \n One of the main reasons I believe that it is just a natural landform is because according to the article, mesas are something that is common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. And since the face was located in Cydonia, it wouldn't be out of place for there to be a mesa there. So in the beginning, scientists told everyone what it really was, another Martian mesa, but it was shaped like a face. But many people noted something that was in the article in paragraph 2, where it said that the mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. My explanation for this is maybe the mesa was formed a certain way that made it have these out of place shadows, because not every mesa is alike and some may have different shapes than another. Also according to the article, it notes that very few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact, which means there are someone skeptics among scientists, and sure, scientists may be smarter than the average person, but that does not mean they are always correct.\n \n Now we move along to even more important evidence, the pictures. The pictures are important because if you look at the picture of the \"Face on Mars\" taken in 1976, you could see that it really isn't that clear, but you can make out a face in it. But if you look at the better pictures in 1998 and 2001, you can see that they're a whole lot clearer than the ones in 1976. Right now I'm focusing on the one taken in 1998, which according to the article, it was posted on a JPL website where it was revealed as a natural landform. But skeptics again were skeptic as always, and said that since it was taken during the winter, which is a cloudy time on Mars, that the alien markings of the Face were hidden by haze. My reponse to this is, if there were alien markings, why couldn't you make a brief outline of them in the picture from 1976? And how do you know for sure that there are any alien markings? Many questions arose and taken pictures of the Face became a priority.\n \n 3 years later, on April 8, 2001, another picture of the Face was taken. This one was much clearer than the one in 1998 due to there being no clouds. According to the article, the pxiel size in the image was 1.56 meters, and as rule of thumb, if there were any alien markings or another of that sort, they would've been able to be seen in the picture because of the pixels. So the \"Face on Mars\" was got rid of its skeptics and now many scientists say it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. According to the article, Garvin says it remind him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, because it is about the same height of the \"Face on Mars\".\n \n So in conclusion, the \"Face on Mars\" is a mesa plain and simple, and the main reasons are because of the pictures, and overall the really big reason many mesas are common around Cydonia, which is where the Face is located. Another reason why I don't think that you should believe that it is an alien artifact is, there is so much evidence to why it isn't whenever people just pointed out obvious things in the picture, like clouds of haze covered \"markings\" in the 1998 picture but there weren't ever markings on the mesa as revealed in the next picture taken in 2001. So to end this essay, the \"Face on Mars\" is a mesa, not an alien artifact as many skeptics believe.",

Mars is too far away that NASA can't send people up there to make sure it is an alien. There isn't any oxygen up there so people could breathe.\n \n The Face is on Mars, which could be an alien. People have always thought that there were aliens on Mars. This time there actually could be one on Mars. Life on Mars could be a real thing. Mars is a eird place because it is red, unlike Earth which is mostly blue and green.\n \n The Face is a natural landform because NASA has proven that there can't be any life form on Mars. There is nothing that they would be able to eat to stay alive. The planet is red and there isn't any water or anything to drink for them to survive. There is no possible way for any life form to survive on Mars.\n \n There is a natural landform on Mars that looks like a face because huge rocks were fromed together looking like a face. This is all nature, there is no way that aliens could live on this planet. Natural landforms all around the universe. Mountains and hills are all over Earth. Nature takes control of everything that is alive. The Face is a natural landform and not some kind of alien.\n \n The\"Face on Mars\" is a natural landform because aliens can't live on a planet without anything to survive, natural ladforms are all over the universe, and the Face is just huge rocks formed together looking like a face. I strongly believe that this is not an alien, and that this is a natural landform.",

    essay: "Some people believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is just an alien artifact. Although these people believe this, it is not true. The \"face\" that was discovered on the surface of Mars was really just a mesa. This was proven, when scientists used a special camera to capture what we were really seeing. The camera used showed everything that it captured. It was so clear that no matter what it had taken a picture of you'd be able to tell exactly what it was.\n \n This was a huge attraction to everyone. This topic bacame very popular. The truth was then revealed. The huge attraction, the \"Face on Mars\", was just a landform. Things like this were commonly found around Cydonia, thus proving that things like this are somewhat common in this area. The picture taken showed a butte or a mesa which are said to be commonly found in the American West. It was even compared to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. In conclusion the disception of the \"Face on Mars\" was all just a misunderstanding. The truth was unfolded an now the world knows what the \"Face on Mars\" really was; a mesa.",

    essay: "As a NASA scientist I know more about how the Face is not made from aliens. First off how would aliens create the face because they probably never seen a human. We never seen any evidence that supports that aliens are real. So how would aliens create the face if we don't have any evidence that they are real?\n \n The face is made from rocks. Rocks like from Mars. The face is just a natural landform nothing else. Since the Face is made from Rocks and is on Mars it is called a mesa. Its basically a huge rock formation eveyone would say, even I would say it. There might have been an ancient civillization there, but we are still finding out new stuff everyday.\n \n Yes the face has been a pop icon. It has appeared in many books, magazines even radio talk shows. Some people even think that it is possible that there is somehow life there on Mars.\n \n You shouldn't believe that aliens really did make the face. We don't have any proof that aliens are even real. So we can't say that aliens made the face. Since there are humans are Earth then there could probably once have been humans on Mars, but we have no clue at all. So far its just a natural landform since we have no proof its made from humans or even possible aliens.",

    essay: "The Face on Mars was at first just a shadowy likeness of a human face. Yet, as we focused more and more into the Face the more superficial it became. Is it a Martian? Is there life on Mars?\n \n Well, from the evidence given, it is very likely that the superstions are false, and the Face is just a landform.\n \n The Face was captured again on April 5, 1998 by the MOC which gave a sharper photo. That alone was enough proof to show that the Face is just a landform. Even though it was very cloudy around Mars around that time, it would still be difficult to pass over the Face. The MOC scans over the planet with narrow 2.5 km-wide strips which would make it very hard to miss over the Face.\n \n Lastly on April 8, 2001 NASA captured an extraordinarry photo of the Face. It was a cloudless, summer day which squelched all objections of it being too cloudy around Cydonia to capture a good photo. Each pixel in the photo spans 1.56 meters, whereas the best photo in 1976 only had 43 meters per pixel. The photo was so spectacular that you could zoom in 3 times the pixels size, so even if there were life, small shacks, or pyramids on Mars, you'd be able to see them.\n \n In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landform. the 2001 photo gives enough evidence that even if there were life or monuments on Mars you would be able to see them. The photo in 1998 was also a good photo, so good that it would be hard to even miss over the Face. Also, even if there were life on Mars NASA would have no reason to hide it, it would help their company more than it would be a detriment to it. The article states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West.",

    essay: "Things aren't always as they appear, just because it looks that way doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The formation on Mars does look like a face but it is just a land formation it's not like land formations are rare. Coincidences happen all the time, this is just one of those times. You can't judge something based on how it's looked, you have to really pay attention.\n \n Formations are a very common thing, both on Earth and on Mars. It is nothing strange, what is strange is that it looks like a head. But even at the picture was taken in 1976 with a much lower quality of camera so things wouldn't have looked as clear as a more modern camera, the other picture was taken in 2001, technology would have advanced and improved much in that time span as it was 25 years later. The quality would have improved so it would have been much easier to see and to know what it really was, it was just a coincidence and coincidences are just as common as land formations.\n \n Coincidences happen a lot, and this is just one of the instances that it happens. It may look like a face and something that was made but when you look at it again, with a different perspective you see what it really is. Like sometimes you will have food, like chips and it will look like a face or an object, but just because it looks like that doesn't mean that is that. Or sometime you will see something, but then have to look again to see if that's really what you saw, it's the same concept. Just because you see it doesn't mean it is that or that is even there. Magic is a good example as it is just an illusion, it's happening in front of you but that doesn't mean it's actually there, because when you see how it's really done it's not so magic. The clouds may look like animals floating in the sky but they are still just clouds. All of this brings it back to the same point, that the land formation may look like a face that was created but when you really look at it and realize what it is you know what it really is, just another land formation.\n \n You may say that aliens made something like this but that just doesn't make sense. That's like saying that people made the Grand Canyon or that people made the Rocky Mountains. These things would have made by what was there and things that affected them, not by people or aliens. There is no evidence that aliens even exist, so with lacking that proof how can you say something that never existed or at least something that is unable to be proved existed made this.\n \n It all loops and loops and loops. You end up with the same thing and it just becomes repetitive. You can say that aliens made this but you lack proof, where as it's just a land mass has plenty of evidence to back it up. It is just a coincidence that it looked like a face.",

With us humans we have many different statues monuments tall skyscrapers not just one of them.

Some people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens or any kind of life on Mars, and NASA is trying to keep the public from knowing.\n \n The first reason is that it has been confirmed by NASA that the human face is just an illusion! This illusion created by shadows gives it the appearance of a human face. Now some people may believe that NASA is saying that it is an illusion because they want to hide that they have been given a sign of life in space. Most people do not know that if there was life on Mars then NASA would benefit, which I will speak more about in the next paragraph.\n \n The second reason to convince you that the \"Face on Mars\" is just a landform is that if there was life on Mars, it would be no secret! NASA would financially benefit from life on Mars. Think of all the publicity NASA would get and how much money that would bring to them, they could fund a lot more programs and projects.\n \n The third reason is that we can not question the power of the technology they have at NASA. NASA has taken several looks at the face and each time the results are the same. They have extraordinary cameras and photography technology at NASA. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, most common in the American West.\n \n Although some people might still believe that the face is not just a landform, the facts show that it is just an illusion with shadows giving the appearance of a face.

    essay: "When looking at the Face over the years, you can clearly tell that it's a landform. From 1976 to 2001 the Face has lost almost all features to make it look like a face. For example, in 1976 you could clearly see a nose and eyes. By 1998 you could hardly make out the form of the nose and there was a crack where a mouth would have been bplaced. Finally, by 2001 you could hardly see any of its features. In the following paragraphs I will discuss detalis and characteristics into further detail.\n \n When I took a first looked at the Face, in the photo from 1976, I saw a clear face with a nose, eyes, and the feature of a pharoh.\n \n By 1998 I could no longer see the eyes and nose look caved in. I did however see the form of a mouth that I didn't see before. A martian couldn't make a face out of the ground because nobody knows for sure that they're real. No one has ever seen a martian so how do we know that they're even there? Land however could completely make this. If you look at Earth and the mountains that have been formed, not by man but by the land, you know that there's no way martian's could've built this.\n \n Also, nobody has proof that this isn't just shadows reflecting onto the ground. There might not even be a landform there but the shadows are forming an allusion that makes it look like a land mass. In paragraph 9, Garvin says, \"We don't just pass over the Face very often.\" When Garvin says this, it makes me believe more that it's just a shadow because they don't see it very often. The sun might have to be placed just right to cast the shadows onto that specific spot. Lastly, how would martians know what an ancient pharoh looked like?\n \n Now I'm going to sides with the martian's. If martians were in fact a real living thing, why couldn't they build something to look like a face? I'm sure that they would have hands, fingers, feet, and toes just like humans. If this Face was martian made, maybe they were trying to send a signal to someone like, \"Hey, we really are here and we need your help!\" They could've known that there were space rovers going around their planet from somewhere else. There's no telling who built the Face.\n \n There's no telling how the Face got there or why. The most realistic and logical explanation is that the land formed it. There are many conspiraces out there as to how and why the Face is on Mars. I choose to believe that they had a \"Mars Quake\" and the face just appeared. But in reality nobody knows how it was formed.",

The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to a mesa here on Earth.

If the Face were created by an alien civilization, NASA would greatly benefit. Therefore, there would be no reason to hide the information. \"defenders of the NASA budjet wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars\" (5). The second photo of the Face on Mars was claimed by some to be inconclusive because of the haze created by the winter weather on Mars. However, a third photo of the Face was taken on April 8, 2001 \"a cloudless summer day in Cydonia [the region of Mars where the Face resides]\" (10) tat also clearly shows that the Face on Mars is not a face at all, but simply a natural land formation.\n \n The Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural land formation. \"'[the Face on Mars] reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.

If the ruins of an alien civilization actually existed on Mars, NASA would reap a great benifit, meaning that there would be no reason to hide the discovery. The first picture showing the Face on Mars as merely a natural landform was dismissed by skeptics because the time of year the photo was taken gave the camera a layer of haze to look through to see the face. This haze, skeptics said, hid the alien markings from view. However, this was disproven in April 2001, when a new photo was taken during the clear summertime on Mars. This photo still showed that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to the mesas of Earth.",

After that though, scientisits figured out it was just another Martian mesa common around Cydonia.

This \"face\" is just a natural landform. Many years ago scientists thought it was a sign of life too, but this was short lived.

The \"Face on Mars\" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in movies, magazines, radio talk shows, and as the passage says \"Haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years\". This is a perfect example of why you shouldn't trust what you see on movies, online, or read in magazines.\n \n In the passage it says,\"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hid, say conspiracy theorists.

    essay: "The \"Face of Mars\" is clearly a natural landmark that, in a low resolution camera, looked like a face. Until there is proof of life on Mars, there is not a single chance that something couldv'e made this. It is actually a very common mesa on Mars and this is why it cannot be man-made.\n \n First of all, the photo taken at first and released to the public was not very good. The difference between the photo from 1976 and 2001 is extremely noticable. The picture from 1998 looks the most like a face, but it is still quite a stretch to say that it is a face. The high-resolution images and 3D altimetry completely disproves it and shows what it really, a mesa.\n \n Now some skeptics might say that NASA might be unreliable and might have changed the photo. There are two things wrong with that arguement. If NASA had discovered new life on Mars, they would most defineitly share it with the public. Everyone would know that there were other lifeforms on other planets, and this would be extremely benificial to NASA. They would get all the funding they need to do more exploration deeper into space. They would get more scientists interested in making technology for space travel. They would get more brave volenteers for space travel. The second thing wrong is the difference between sources of information. All the info people have about the face is either from NASA itself and pop culture like movies or magazines. So if you trust magazines and movies more than a well supplied and well known orginazation like NASA, then you don't have as reliable sources making your own arguement not very believable.\n \n In conclution, skeptics don't have any reliable proof that hasn't been already disproven.",

    essay: "Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.\n \n Us scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to \"landforms common around the American West\", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the \"Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\" here on Earth.\n \n If that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states \"Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.\" This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, \"defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.\n \n If you're still not convinced, look at the picture we took of The Face on April 5, 1998, \"when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time\". NASA got a picture \"ten times sharper than the original Viking photos\", as stated in paragraph 7. This means that it was much easier to see The Face, and what it actually was. The pictures revealed something amazing... the Face was \"a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" I know, shocking! But these are just the facts. Some argued that is was cloudy that day on Mars, so \"alien markings were hidden by haze\", as it states in paragraph 8. So we took a better picture on April 8, 2001 - an uncloudy day on Mars - showing, again, that it was just a landform. Nothing more to it.\n \n In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform on Mars, similar to those here on our home planet, Earth. As far as anyone knows, even NASA, there are no life-forms on Mars of any kind that made The Face. As it says in paragraph 12, the pictures we took on April 8 were so high-quality that \"\"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\" If there were any kind of aliens or alien markings on the Face, or creating the Face at that time, you would have been able to see it in that picture. The Face \"is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa\", landforms commonly seen here on Earth. That's all there is to it. No aliens. No magic. Just natural happenings, that's simply all the Face is.",

I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA.\n \n My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.\n \n My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos! When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\n \n This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien . these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head. Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking.",

    essay: "Can aliens really create a face on the moon? No, they cant! I know this because the picture snapped of the face from 1976, was bit blurry, once they got abetter camera the picture became more clear and looked less like a face. Only some of the scientist beleived the face was a 'alien artifact'. There is proof that it is just a landform that looks like a face.\n \n The picture from 1976 was a bad quality picture, it was blurry and you couldnt see much of the real features that were there. Once cameras got better and more HD the pictures got more clear and you could actually see the cracks and the rough parts if the landform. In 2001, the picture was good, it looked less like a face when the cameras got better, but it still had that face effect on it.\n \n Only some of the scientist beleived that the face looking land form was created by aliens, not all. When they snapped the first picture in 1976, some of the scientist noticed the face and the first thing that came to there mind was that aliens did it. They started to go back and capture a picture of the face looking landform. Cyndonia became a priority for NASA when they arrived at the 'Red Planet' in September 1997.\n \n They finnaly figured that it was just a regualr landform that had been created like face, not by aliens but by nature. The picture actually shows is the Martain equivlent of butte or mesa, those are landforms common around the American West. Scientist state that \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\". Also he says \"Thats the lava dome that taks the form of isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars\".\n \n The face on mars could have been crated by aliens though. Aliens cpuld have easily managed the curves and the ways the face looks, the nose, eyes, ears, mouth and the way it was even shaped looked like a alien head. It is very possible for it to be alins who have created this face, maybe it was a sign that aliens are here or asign that aliens know about humas.\n \n Most landforms mostly get created about how the surroundings are or whos there. There is stuff called man made and thats made by human, but no ones ever heard of alien made. Since they used the better camera with better pixels and better HD, it turns out that the face looking lanform on Mars was just another weird looking landform, no aliens, just landform.",

    essay: "Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.\n \n The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.\n \n Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.\n \n It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.\n \n This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars.",

In fact, the Face is just a natural landform.\n \n The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.\n \n The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

    essay: "Lets face the facts the face on Mars is nothing more than clever illusion. The face that you have no doubt seen on mars isn't proof of alein life it just doesn't make logical sense. The higher quality photos don't even show the face, and why would NASA cover up somthing that would help them with their budget issues. Its clearly just rock formation just like ones we have on earth.\n \n First of all the first picture was just a lucky happenstance. When NASA went back in to get a higher quality photo, it wasn't there. The face was just a product of clouds and outdated equipment. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" (P10) The best quality photo, and it looked less like a face and more like a pile of broken dreams.\n \n Some hardcore conspiracy theorists might say NASA was trying to pull a wool over our eyes and cover up the existents of extraterestrial life with fake pictures. But why would NASA cover somthing as earth shattering as aliens, the publicity alone would help push the government to extend their budget.\" Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\" (P5) Why would litteral rocket scientists cover up something that would help the massively.\n \n Thirdly it's just like rock formations we have on earth. In the article one scientist even says it looks just like a butte we have on Earth. \" It reminds me of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" (P12) We are all losing our heads over somthing that we could drive to Idaho in a matter of hours to see.\n \n Overall only crazy conspiracy nuts could ignore the facts to this degree. Its was a one time photo that happened almost 40 years ago. People need to quit ignoring the facts and see whats right in front of them. The face on Mars is just a natural land form that, under the right conditions, can look like a face.",

How could The Face on Mars be created by aliens if aliens aren't real? Why would NASA go through all that trouble to make a fake Face on Mars.\n \n The face is a natural landform because, before it was a face NASA captioned it as a \"Huge rock formation\". It was a humans head it was also formed by shadows, which made it seem like the huge rock formation had eyes, nose, and a mouth. But it was just an illusion. NASA knew that if they were to put the \"huge rock formation\" on Mars they would attract a lot of attention. The were right!

    essay: "In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit. Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars.\n \n One reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. In paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.\n \n But even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that NASA was trying to cover something up. In spite of the new pictures people said that the day the photo was taken, it was cloudy. Therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate. In fact, these theorists were right. The day the photo was taken was in winter. It says in paragraph 8 that, \" ... it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" These facts show that the landmass could indead be hidden by clouds. However, NASA still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform.\n \n While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,\" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, the face on mars is supported and not supported. NASA has proven with photographic evidence that it is just a natural occurance while conspiracy theorists say that it is a martian civilization. I think that NASA's facts are very believable, and they have the science to back up their claim. I hope that in the future, more people will base their beleifs off of science and not fictional conspiracy theories.",

They have already spent loads of money for this project and made all the equipment. They would not go through all that trouble just to lie to the public. NASA also took may pictures with their instruments from many angles and different views. They are high resolution photographs and they even have 3D alimetry, according to the article \"Unmasking the Face of Mars.\"\n \n Overall, NASA is an important space project that is honest and truthful about their work. They prove their claims with scientific facts and photos. They have the brains, tools, and budget that allows them to do that. If the public is not happy with their results they will find a different way to show it and find more evidence that will satisfy them.",

    essay: "In 1976, the spacecraft Viking 1 took a photo of a certain area on Mars. When NASA saw the photo, they saw what looked like a face. However, many years later, the Face turned out to be a natural formation, like a mesa is on Earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that the Face is not an alien artifact. Also, NASA has found no other evidence of alien life on Mars, so the chances that the Face is made by aliens go down even more. Some people still believe that this Face has something do to with aliens. Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding evidence from us, and that they don't want us to know about aliens on Mars. This theory is also disproved. Jim Garvin said that it's hard work to get photographs of the area, so why would NASA work so hard to get pictures of the Face if they wanted to hide it? Furthermore, NASA would love to find an ancient alien civilization, and would probably share it if they did find something. Finally, there is one more piece of evidence that the Face wasn't made by aliens. There are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face. I would give an example but I cant do any research because this is a test. The reasons above prove that the landform on Mars known as the Face, is NOT made by aliens.",

Not only is this crazy, it's impossible. It's impossible because we spent a lot of time and money reaserching if humans can go live on Mars.

    essay: "The Face of Mars has proven to be one of NASA's most mystifying cases to ever be solved. Twenty five years ago, as NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, it snapped a photo of a startling image resembling a human face. After releasing the image to the public, many people became fascinated in the \"face\". This rolled the ball for many people to believe there was an ancient civilization on Mars. However, modern technology and expertise of numerous scientists have discovered the face is merely a natural landform. The use of more efficient cameras have diminished any hopes of alien life on Mars.\n \n NASA's Mars Exploration Program has already identified the area on which the face is found as Cydonia. When the face was first seen in the Jet Propulsion Lab, scientists figured it was a Martian mesa, which were common enough in Cydonia. Although it was abnormally figured in the shape of a human face, scientists already knew mesa's were prominent in the area of Cydonia. Also, modern technology, such as a Mars Global surveyor camera, has revealed the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. The camera's absolute maximum resoultion picture ensures that no \"alien markings\" were hidden by haze, as some skeptics argued. In the 2001 image, each pixel spans 1.56 meters, whereas pixels in the 1976 image spanned 43 meters. Therefore, the better camera quality ensures the truth behind the Face on Mars: a natural landform.\n \n Some people argue that, due to the cloudiness on the planet, alien life could have been hidden by haze. However, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor on \"a cloudless summer day in Cydonia\" and captured another photo. Garvin explained \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.\" Garvin knew if there were any pyramids or shacks, the camera would have been able to capture it and he would have been able to see it. Thus, there is no chance haze could have hidden the aliens. People also argued that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence NASA would rather hide. This is not the case. Authors thought this would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. Therefore, the belief of life on Mars is simply just for the public. It has been in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The Face on Mars was used to engage the public, not neccessariy to inform.\n \n Proven from better camera quality and scientific knowledge, people can know believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If any civilization was there, the Mars Global Surveyor would have been able to seen it. Also, mesa's are common in the Cydonia area, where the face was found. In conclusion, better technology from 1976 proves the Face on Mars is a landfrom, and there is no chance any life on Mars exists based on the face.",

A few years ago NASA discovered what seemed to look like a face on Mar's surface. Many think that the so called \"Face\" was created by alien's. But others think it was just created by natural causes just like how some landforms are created on Earth. How do you think that the formation was created?\n \n So far NASA hasn't discovered any alien markings or any other form of life on other planets. This is one of the reasons why the formation was created by natural causes and not by alien's. Just like on Earth we discover something new every day, such as new landforms and new natural resources. The formation couldn't of been formed by alien's because where did they get the tools to make it? If aliens exsited, i think we would have more evidence.\n \n Alien's don't exsit becuase we would have found some evidence of diffrent life on diffrent planet's by now. If their are no aliens then their are no alien made objects on Mars. Alien's probably would have found a better communication rought then sending us weird landforms that dont have much meaning at all.\n \n Why of all things would the aliens create a face? Even if aliens did exsit i don't think it is their goal in their life to scare us humans. They would probably make something more reasonable, like a house or something like a shelter.\n \n Along with the formation there are also many landforms on earth that are similar. Such as the Grand Cannon and things like that. Think if the humans lived on Mars and we came to Earth and saw the Grand Cannon we would automatically think that there must be life here since there is no other way this could have been formed.

Untill their is more evidence about alien's we should not believe that they exsit.\n \n As it says in the artical \"What the picture actually shows is the Maritian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West.\" This landform represents many of the already discovered landforms on earth such as the Grand Cannon and their is no official evidence that aliens exsit this is obviously a naturally formed landform and not created by aliens.",

I think if aliens were on Mars I think we might have discovered them by now, but you can never be sure.\n \n The Face is just formed by conveniently placed shadows. NASA wishes there was life on Mars becase they would benefit from it, so why would they try to cover up something that could get them a lot of popularity and money. Scientists researched this farther and released even better pictures proving it was just a landmass and not an alien artifact. People believe that the clouds could've covered up alien markings but that seems illogical because in 2001 they went back to the face and took more pictures with even higher resolution and found that there were no markings at all, meaning more evidence leaning towards the Face just being a natural landmass and not an alien artifact. It was just a mesa the whole time.\n \n So there is a lot of evidence leading you to believe that the Face on Mars is merely just a natural landmass called a mesa, combined with shadows gives the mass a facelike texture.

The passage states that no aliens have interloped the area or anything. The text showed that overtime the face has deceased of showing up.

The text states that on April 5, 1998 they got the first really well took picture of the Face on Mars. When they uploaded the picture, nothing of the sort of alien industry being there. The text also stated, \"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monunment after all.\"\n \n The Face on Mars was incredible to see. The people were craving to see the alien life become on Mars and as so was the NASA people. Everyone was stoked to have maybe a new set of living creatures come out. \" The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows - even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\" Although, the Face on Mars was the only face that could be seen on there. The more pictures taken of this Face on Mars the more everyone found out that the face was more of a natural landform. \"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.",

    essay: "Unmasking the Face on Mars\n \n Introduction:\n \n [The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was formed over the years. It could of been made by an alien, but that is so unreal.]\n \n The Face on Mars was common around Cydonia, but the only thing is this face had a unusal shadow which made the face look like a Egytian Pharaoh. Over the years that have passed the Face has become more like a rock shape then a actual face. The face look like a rock that resemble a human head in some sort.\n \n We really don't know what made the face or how the face was formed. The face was \"formed by the shadows that create a illusion of eyes nose and mouth\". - Unmasking the Face of Mars\n \n Also over the years the face has become more of a pop icon that was for most popular stuff. Honestly how could the face be created by an alien when it was such in human formed, but the over the years change rock like. The Face has been compare to some of the Earth natural landfrom. It look like Snake River Plain of Idaho. I think that the face is an artifact that was formed over years ago from its natural landform and hasn't been seen into now.",

    essay: "Have you ever thought maybe there was life on mars?\n \n Well there is no life on mars. Well you might think diffrent but there are a ton of facts to prove there is not life on mars. So here are the facts to prove this thought\n \n In the article \"Unmasking the Faces on Mars\" gives a picture of what apears to be a face, and that is what they thought until more studies show diffrent facts. \"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, sanpping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camras from a region of the red planet called Cybonia.\" This text fro m\"unmasking the Face on Mars\" show there was a possible human alien type thing on mars, but after more years of studing the picuter and taking better picures they found this out. \"On April 5 1998, when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a pictuer ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\" This evidence shows that there is no life forms on mars that we know about.\n \n So in concluion to all of this mars Dose not have life formss on it. There is a chance that there is life forms but according to all the evidicne NASA has found as of right now there is no life forms on planet mars. So jsut be on the look at for more information from NASA as our techolagey and studies become better and better proving for sure that there is no life on Mars.",

    essay: "The face that NASA found on mars was not made by aliens. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and got better pictures than the Viking did and it showed that there was no alien monument, it was just a natural landfrom. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. Lastly the picture that the Viking took was not very good quality compared to the pictures took in 2001.\n \n One reason that the Face on Mars was not made by aliens is because the Mars Global Surveyor got the best picture of it in 2001 and it just turned out to be a natural landform. In line 11 it says that \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" he also added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n Another reason that the Face was not made by aliens is that the face is the equivalent of as butte or a mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 12 it compares the Face on Mars to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.\n \n The pictures that the\n \n Mars Global Surveyor took in 2001 were a lot more clearer than the pictures took by the Viking in 1976. In paragraph 10 it says that Malin's team captured an amazing picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixal in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixal in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how bad the quality was in the 1976 photo taken by the Viking. Also, it proves that it was not a good photo and that the 2001 photo shows so much more and is way better quality. Other people might say that in the photo of '98, taken by the cmaera on board the MGS had to pear through wispy clouds to see the face, which made the alien markings hidden by the haze. Then the picture or 2001 proved that there was no alien markings and that the Face was just a landform.\n \n In conclusion, this is why I believe that the Face of Mars was not made by aliens and is just a natural landform. First of all, The Mars Global Surveyor got better quality pictures than the Vikning did. Also, the 2001 picture shows that the Face is the equivalent to a mesa or butte, which are landforms that are common in the American West. Lastly, when you compare the '76, '98, and the '01 picture side by side you can tell that the '98 and the '01 pictures are more clear and show that the Face is just a landform.",

    essay: "If you think that the mask on the fave of mars is reall? Well im here to prove you wrong and to show you that there is a scientific reason why there is somtheing like that on mars. First, I'll talk to you about how it is that it got to be like that. Secondly, i will explain how it was made. Lastly, I will show you how and prove to you with facts of how it was proven to not be aliens who built this face on mars.\n \n First, I am positive of what you said about the aliens creating this face and then the government taking them to area 51, is a lie. The alines weren't the ones to create this face because it was what we like to call the mesa or you can also call it the butte. Anyway, the mesa is like a lot of landforms that we have here in western part of America, just as it states in paragrph 12. Secondly, when people started to make assumptions it was because NASA had not been able to take a clear image. So you can not say that it was the aliens because the rest of the world was sayng it. Thirdly, we really couldnt find it whenever we wanted because it was hard to find. As it states in paragraph 9. ''We have to scan the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips'' said Jim Garvin. so this are some small but really to the point facts so you can have and understanding about the face of mars and so you can stop thinking that it was aliens who created this face.",

    essay: "Aliens vs. Knowledge\n \n Twenty-five years before 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a landform in the shape of a face on Mars's surface. This, after being released to the media, caused an uprising of speculations. Did aliens make this? Were there other beings on other planets? Are we not alone?\n \n A famous scientist once said that we researched for other life on other planets because humans didn't want to be alone in this vast galaxy. He also said that it could cause either fear or excitement. The media wanted to grab the attention of the common people, and to do that they needed something extraordinary. The media spins the truth to benefit their needs. You can't believe everything they say because all they can do is gain by your speculation.\n \n NASA hardly thought this was the work of aliens. They didn't want the people to think they were lying, they wanted to seek the truth. Even if they were hiding something, they could only ever lose everything for covering it up. More attention on the dying out NASA program would gain the support and money to fund them. So, on April 5, 1998, they sent another spacecraft to take pictures of the landform.\n \n Not everyone thought the image that came up, the one of a landform, sufficed. They argued that it was probably too hazy and that the image wasn't a reliable resource. They said that the haze was blocking the alien markings.\n \n Again, NASA sent another spacecraft in 2001 to take better pictures in different angles. The picture showed a landform much like a butte or mesa here on Earth. Some people stated that it was a conspiracy.\n \n Mars has unique quirks like every planet. Here on earth we have natural landforms such as a mesa, and mountains, and rivers. Mars isn't much different.\n \n Scientists have special catogories for classifying a planet, and Pluto did not meet those requirements. So, every planet has to have at least one thing in common with another. Just beacause Mars is a different planet, doesn't mean that it can't have landforms much like those on Earth.\n \n To say that one planet has aliens because of a landform, is to say that we are aliens as well. Don't we have mountains? Yes, you might say, but it's because of tectonic plates pushing against each other. Science has taught us many things, so now we know something foreign to people back then.\n \n Take Christopher Columbus as in example. Before he sailed the ocean, everyone thought that the earth was flat. After he disproved the theory, people saw the earth for what it was: a round, water planet. Another great example would be Galileo, who disproved the theory that Earth was the center of the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around it. People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is. Now, we don't question on how the mountains were made. We don't question on why we have day and night.\n \n We are more educated now, but there are still things we haven't learned. That's why people should have a more open mind about finding the truth. Once we find the truth, we'll move on to bigger things and so on and so on. This mystery is one which piques people's interest, but turning to myth and false facts isn't the way to go. Exploring and learning from new innovations is what makes scientists who they are. They took the time to go through the process of being a certified scientist. To say you are smarter than one is disrespectful towards them, saying all their hard work was worth nothing.\n \n So, to summarize, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. It was a natural occurence that got blown up into bigger proportions because the media wanted to satisfy their own needs to get profit. NASA knows what they are saying, and we should respect their statements until we ,for sure, know ourselves that the statement is false.",

    essay: "Twenty five years ago the Viking 1 spacecraft was taking pictures of Mars, when the spacecraft got a picture of something that looked like a human face, they named it the Face. Scientist from NASA have done futher research on the Face and think that it is a mesa, but others think that the Face was created by aliens. The Face on Mars is simply, a natural landform, and was not created by aliens like some people think.\n \n When the scientist discovered the Face they were very excited because they thought it was something special, but the feeling was short lived. The scientist figured out it was a Martian mesa, which is very common around Cydonia. To better describe the Face would be to say it is: a huge rock formation that respembles a human head. A mesa is a rock formation and rocks can look like all kinds of things, even a human head.\n \n Pictures were taken of the Face in 1976, 1998, and 2001 the resolution on the pictures getting better as technology advances. If one simply looks at the pictures they could tell that the Face is just a rock and it was not alien-made. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original pictures, it was then that the scientist decided that the Face was a rock. The people were still in denial, so NASA set out to get more pictures in 2001. When the pictures came back it was clear that the Face was still just a mesa and was not made by aliens.\n \n At this point the scientist were satisfied, the Face was just a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. One scientist even compared it to things on Earth. Scientist Jim Garvin said, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\". The Face is a mesa that was formed naturally just like a mesa on Earth. They both look the same and were not created by aliens.\n \n The Face that was found on Mars in 1976, was not made by aleins and is just a mesa that was formed naturally. Multiple pictures determined that it just happened to look like a human face and upon closer examination was not alien-made. The Face has been compared to things on Earth like a butte or a mesa multiple times. This proves that the Face was not made by aliens and is a natural Martian mesa.",

There has been no proof of any of those things. Say there were aliens living on earth. Would that make a difference in how we lived? My opinion it would. There would be different things, different looking people maybe. You can not live without water or oxygen. Oxygen is not on Mars or in outer space. There has also been no proof of water on Mars either.\n \n The article says that for almost 25 years, NASA has been looking for proof on what this thing is.

    essay: "Do you think there is a face on Mars created by aliens on Cydonia? Lets talk about it. Cydonia is a huge red planet. Better stated in pargraph one, \"An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camera from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.\" On this beautiful reddish planet, people thought there was a human face carved in it. They do not know how, and they do not know who did it.\n \n What did people see on this great sized planet? People saw a face, with shadows forming human face features! After Nasa had generously let the images on display for everyone to see, it became a huge news story. Everyone was, as said, talking about the unspecified \"Face on Mars\". The word was soon sent out by everyone ,and the public was attract to what they had seen in the picture of mars! The public went balistic after seeing such an amazing picture!\n \n What did NASA and scientists say about this human looking face? They had said it was just a natural created landform! When they flew over the beautiful Cydonia to snap a better picture of \"The Face\" that was sharper, they had said, \"There was no alien monument after all.\" Not everyone had agreed with what they had said, which cause a comotion. Other people had said they were clearly oblivious to the alien markings hidden by the haze. Which then, NASA had to send more people to look at the face once more.\n \n What had happened the second time they send people to search \"The Face.\" Well, they had a little bit of trouble this time around! They had said, it was not easy, and It had been very hard work. They also said, in paragraph 9, \"We just don't pass over the Face very often.\" Next, they found a great cloudless summer day to finally search Cydonia. There team had caught an \"Extraordinary photo usimg the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Their picture had been 100x better the second time around! They stated, \"Well, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\n \n In conclusion, If were unseen aliens on Cydonia, they would most likely know about it!

    essay: "The Face on Mars was created by natural landforms and it is impossible to have been created by aliens. First,there was no sign of alien interaction on Mars when the Face appeared. Next,it has been proven that the picture of the Face was actually a butte or mesa landform. Also, the other picture that was taken was more visual and it was 3 times bigger than the original. The Face couldn't have been formed by alien life.\n \n One reason that proves that the Face is natural is that there has never been any alien interaction evidence on any planet. First of all,it is not possible for aliens to create a face in cement rock. Next,aliens wouldn't know what a face would look like because they wouldn't have a mirror and they wouldn't even know what they look like. Finally,if aliens were able to move rock,they wouldn't have any tools to use. Aliens couldn't have formed the Face if we don't even know if they exist.\n \n Another reason that the Face is natural is that it has been proven that the Face was created by a butte or mesa landform. First,these landforms are very common in the American West. Next,Garvin knows that they are common because he mentioned,\"it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\"Garvin also said that the Middle Butte landform is the same height as the Face on Mars. If the Face is similar to another landform,it is most likely a natural landform.\n \n The final reason that the Face is natural is that the first picture that was taken,isn't as clear as the newer picture. First,when the original picture was taken,it was very cloudy and difficult to see during the winter in April. This could have been mistaken for alien markings because the sight wasn't easy to see. Finally,the newer picture that was taken had a digital image 3 times bigger than the original pixel in the first photo. The newer photo proves that aliens were not around at all.\n \n In conclusion,many people may have thought the Face was formed by aliens,but they only thought that because of the evidence they were given. The original photo was not clear so the newer photo shows what it really looked like. The Face also had similar features to mesa and butte landforms which are very common in many areas. Since there was no evidence to show that aliens were there,it's not reliable to believe. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform that formed suddenly and it can happen anywhere.",
